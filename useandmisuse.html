<p><span class=title>USE OF PROLE.INFO MATERIAL</span></p>
<p>Feel free to print and distribute the comic books and posters on this site. Feel free to reproduce parts or all of the comic books or posters wherever you want, so long as you give a link to or otherwise acknowledge the full comic.
Chapters from "Abolish Restaurants" were printed in <em>The Northeastern Anarchist</em>, <em>Fifth Estate</em>, and <em>Rolling Thunder</em> and in the required reading for a class on "The Geography of Food and Eating" at the University of Washington.</p>
<p>Feel free to use prole.info drawings to make your own flyers, posters, stickers, or pamphlets so long as your material is in overwhelming agreement with the political perspective in the prole.info comic books. If you have questions, email <img src="images/email.gif"></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span class=title>MISUSE OF PROLE.INFO MATERIAL</span></p>
<p>Do <strong><em>not</em></strong> use material from this site for advertisements of any kind, or for pamphlets, flyers, posters or stickers that put forward a substantially different political perspective from the site, or that have nothing to do with the political perspective of this site. If you're not sure what political perspective this site puts forward, don't use the images.
</p><p>
The following were all <strong><em>not</em></strong> produced by prole.info and are examples of how <strong><em>not</em></strong> to use material from this site.
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>French/Italian fascist group "Zentropa" stole some images and used them on stickers. Clearly this is the exact opposite of everything prole.info supports.</p>   
<p>&nbsp;</p>               
<p><img align=left src=images/nobakunin.gif><br><br><br>Someone rearranged and rewrote "Work Community Politics War" for a Russian translation and called it "What is Communism?". It was now much shorter because the "translator" had "<em>taken out all the influence of Bakunin</em>". </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>            
<p>&nbsp;</p>            
<p>&nbsp;</p>            
<p>&nbsp;</p>            
<p>&nbsp;</p>                 
<p><img align=right src=images/crimethinc1.gif><br><br><br>Crimethinc produced a poster using a graphic from "Abolish Restaurants". Presumably it was meant to be hung in collective houses over the kitchen sink. It includes gems like "<em>If you can't wash, it's not my revolution...</em>" There's nothing necessarily wrong with living in collective houses, but they have nothing to do with the political perspective of this site.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>            
<p>&nbsp;</p>           
<p>&nbsp;</p>            
<p><img align=left src=images/crimethinc2.gif><br><br><br>Crimethinc strikes again with a pamphlet against the 2008 US elections using a part of the "Capitalist Society" poster as the cover. It critiques capitalist democracy and looks for something that could be "<em>more democratic than democracy.</em>" Besides the ridiculous implication that consensus should be used by anything other than small groups, it confuses social relations with decision making processes. It's not the worst pamphlet ever, but the superficial critique of capitalist social relationships means that it contains some terrible ideas like: 
"<em>If you want corporations to have less power, don't petition the politicians they bought to 
put limits on their own masters -- take that power from them yourself. Don't 
buy their products, don't work for them, sabotage their billboards and offices, 
prevent their meetings from taking place and their merchandise from being 
delivered.</em>"</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>            
<p>&nbsp;</p>            
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img align=right src=images/serviceclass.gif><br><br><br><br><br><br>Someone created this poster and used an image from "Abolish Restaurants".
It is signed "<em>some criminals who were accidentally hired</em>", with a link to prole.info.
It's main point is to argue that there is a "<em>service class</em>" consisting of "<em>servicers</em>" and "<em>precariats</em>".
It then tries to combine this bad idea with a sprinkling of identity politics: "<em>We're on the verge of discovering what servicers, undocumented peoples, black folks, queers, and wimmin bodied folks all share in common.</em>" 
Prole.info would never put out anything this confused, or this poorly written.</p>
