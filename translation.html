<p>If you would like to translate any material on prole.info please get in touch by emailing: <img src="images/email.gif">
</p><p>The following are a few things to remember when translating prole.info texts. Some of them are basic translation tips and some of them are specific to translating prole.info texts. Please take a look before translating.
</p><blockquote>

<p><strong>Don't translate literally.</strong><br>
There is nothing uglier than a direct literal translation. The comic books are extended political arguments, and are supposed to be close to how people talk. Use words that best make the point. "Abolish Restaurants" is translated as "&Agrave; Bas les Restaurants" in French (literally "Down with Restaurants") and as "Inga j&auml;vla Restauranger!" in Swedish (literally "No Fucking Restaurants!").</p>
<p><strong>Don't back translate.</strong><br>
The comic books have some quotations from people who were originally writing or speaking in a language other than English. Guy Debord and Raoul Vaneigem wrote in French. Karl Marx usually wrote in German. If you're translating into that language, look up the original instead of translating it back again.</p>
<p><strong>Make sure you understand the technical language.</strong><br>
The comic books use some terms from Marx's critique of political economy, such as "value", "surplus value", "commodities" etc... When translating these, please make sure you're translating them the way Marxist categories are normally translated. There is also some technical language that relates to different kinds of work, such as "two-tops" or "front of the house" etc... If you haven't worked in a restaurant before, and are translating Abolish Restaurants, please talk to someone who has to try to make sure this work-related language is translated authentically.</p>
<p><strong>Look at the pictures when translating.</strong><br>
When translating the text, feel free to change around minor things to make it sound better. But these are comicbooks, not just texts, so if you do this, make sure that the changes make sense with the drawings on the page. Also, take a look at the things written on shirts, signs, tatoos, posters, etc... It may or may not make sense to translate these.</p>
<p><strong>Don't get too politically correct.</strong><br>
Every time it says "workers" in English, there is a problem for people translating into a language with genders. In French, activists sometimes use "travailleurs et travailleuses" (literally "workers [male] and workers [female]"), which is quite long, or more hideously "travailleursEUSES" or "travailleur-euse-s". These kinds of monsterous constructions exist in a lot of languages and should be avoided. You can replace "workers" with "we" in some cases, and in other cases you can use masculine or feminine words depending on whether the people in the pictures on that page are men or women. The goal is to get the text to sound close to how people speak, not to sound like an official statement from a government or a trade union. If that means that sometimes the "male" version of a word is used to mean both male and female, that's fine.</p>
<p><strong>Get someone else to check your translation.</strong><br>
