<p class="title">The Continuing Appeal of Nationalism</p>
<p class="author"> by Fredy Perlman (1985)</p>
<p>

Nationalism was proclaimed dead several times during the present
century:
</p><p>
* after the first world war, when the last empires of Europe, the
Austrian and the Turkish, were broken up into self-determined
nations, and no deprived nationalists remained, except the
Zionists;
</p><p>
* after the Bolshevik coup d'etat, when it was said that the
bourgeoisie's struggles for self-determination were henceforth
superseded by struggles of workingmen, who had no country;
</p><p>
* after the military defeat of Fascist Italy and National
Socialist Germany, when the genocidal corollaries of nationalism
had been exhibited for all to see, when it was thought that
nationalism as creed and as practice was permanently discredited.
</p><p>
Yet forty years after the military defeat of Fascists and National
Socialists, we can see that nationalism did not only survive but
was born again, underwent a revival. Nationalism has been revived
not only by the so-called right, but also and primarily by the so-
called left. After the national socialist war, nationalism ceased
to be confined to conservatives, became the creed and practice of
revolutionaries, and proved itself to be the only revolutionary
creed that actually worked.
</p><p>
Leftist or revolutionary nationalists insist that their
nationalism has nothing in common with the nationalism of fascists
and national socialists, that theirs is a nationalism of the
oppressed, that it offers personal as well as cultural liberation.
The claims of the revolutionary nationalists have been broadcast
to the world by the two oldest continuing hierarchic institutions
surviving into our times: the Chinese State and, more recently,
the Catholic Church. Currently nationalism is being touted as a
strategy, science and theology of liberation, as a fulfilment of
the Enlightenment's dictum that knowledge is power, as a proven
answer to the question "What Is to be Done?"
</p><p>
To challenge these claims, and to see them in a context, I have to
ask what nationalism is - not only the new revolutionary
nationalism but also the old conservative one. I cannot start by
defining the term, because nationalism is not a word with a static
definition: it is a term that covers a sequence of different
historical experiences. I'll start by giving a brief sketch of
some of those experiences.
</p><p class="subtitle">
                              *  *  *
</p><p>
According to a common (and manipulable) misconception, imperialism
is relatively recent, consists of the colonization of the entire
world, and is the last stage of capitalism. This diagnosis points
to a specific cure: nationalism is offered as the antidote to
imperialism: wars of national liberation are said to break up the
capitalist empire.
</p><p>
This diagnosis serves a purpose, but it does not describe any
event or situation. We come closer to the truth when we stand this
conception on its head and say that imperialism was the first
stage of capitalism, that the world was subsequently colonized by
nation-states, and that nationalism is the dominant, the current,
and (hopefully) the last stage of capitalism. The facts of the
case were not discovered yesterday; they are as familiar as the
misconception that denies them.
</p><p>
It has been convenient, for various good reasons, to forget that,
until recent centuries, the dominant powers of Eurasia were not
nation-states but empires. A Celestial Empire ruled by the Ming
dynasty, an Islamic Empire ruled by the Ottoman dynasty and a
Catholic Empire ruled by the Hapsburg dynasty vied with each other
for possession of the known world. Of the three, the Catholics
were not the first imperialists but the last. The Celestial Empire
of the Mings ruled over most of eastern Asia and had dispatched
vast commercial fleets overseas a century before sea-borne
Catholics invaded Mexico.
</p><p>
The celebrants of the Catholic feat forget that, between 1420 and
1430, Chinese imperial bureaucrat Cheng Ho commanded naval
expeditions of 70,000 men and sailed, not only to nearby Malaya,
Indonesia and Ceylon, but as far from home ports as the Persian
Gulf, the Red Sea and Africa. The celebrants of Catholic
conquistadors also belittle the imperial feats of the Ottomans,
who conquered all but the westernmost provinces of the former
Roman Empire, ruled over North Africa, Arabia, the Middle East and
half of Europe, controlled the Mediterranean and hammered on the
gates of Vienna. The imperial Catholics set out westward, beyond
the boundaries of the known world, in order to escape from
encirclement.
</p><p>
Nevertheless, it was the imperial Catholics who “discovered
America”, and their genocidal destruction and plunder of their
“discovery” changed the balance of forces among Eurasia's empires.
</p><p>
Would imperial Chinese or Turks have been less lethal had they
“discovered America”? All three empires regarded aliens as less
than human and therefore as legitimate prey. The Chinese
considered others barbarians; the Muslims and Catholics considered
others unbelievers. The term unbeliever is not as brutal as the
term barbarian, since an unbeliever ceases to be legitimate prey
and becomes a full-fledged human being by the simple act of
converting to the true faith, whereas a barbarian remains prey
until she or he is made over by the civilizer.
</p><p>
The term unbeliever, and the morality behind it, conflicted with
the practice of the Catholic invaders. The contradiction between
professions and acts was spotted by a very early critic, a priest
called Las Casas, who noted that the conversion ceremonies were
pretexts for separating and exterminating the unconverted, and
that the converts themselves were not treated as fellow Catholics
but as slaves.
</p><p>
The critiques of Las Casas did little more than embarrass the
Catholic Church and Emperor. Laws were passed and investigators
were dispatched, but to little effect, because the two aims of the
Catholic expeditions, conversion and plunder, were contradictory.
Most churchmen reconciled themselves to saving the gold and
damning the souls. The Catholic Emperor increasingly depended on
the plundered wealth to pay for the imperial household, army, and
for the fleets that carried the plunder.
</p><p>
Plunder continued to take precedence over conversion, but the
Catholics continued to be embarrassed. Their ideology was not
altogether suited to their practice. The Catholics made much of
their conquests of Aztecs and Incas, whom they described as
empires with institutions similar to those of the Hapsburg Empire
and the religious practices as demonic as those of the official
enemy, the heathen empire of the Ottoman Turks. But the Catholics
did not make much of the wars of extermination against communities
that had neither emperors nor standing armies. Such feats,
although perpetrated regularly, conflicted with the ideology and
were less than heroic.
</p><p>
The contradiction between the invaders' professions and their acts
was not resolved by the imperial Catholics. It was resolved by
harbingers of a new social form, the nation-state. Two harbingers
appeared during the same year, 1561, when one of the Emperor's
overseas adventures proclaimed his independence from the empire,
and several of the Emperor's bankers and provisioners launched a
war of independence.
</p><p>
The overseas adventurer, Lope de Aguirre, failed to mobilize
support and was executed.
</p><p>
The Emperor's bankers and provisioners mobilized the inhabitants
of several imperial provinces and succeeded in severing the
provinces from the empire (provinces which were later called
Holland).
</p><p>
These two events were not yet struggles of national liberation.
They were harbingers of things to come. They were also reminders
of things past. In the bygone Roman Empire, Praetorian guards had
been engaged to protect the Emperor; the guards had assumed ever
more of the Emperor's functions and had eventually wielded the
imperial power instead of the Emperor. In the Arabic Islamic
Empire, the Caliph had engaged Turkish bodyguards to protect his
person; the Turkish guards, like the earlier Praetorians, had
assumed ever more of the Caliph's functions and had eventually
taken over the imperial palace as well as the imperial office.
</p><p>
Lope de Aguirre and the Dutch grandees were not the Hapsburg
monarch's bodyguards, but the Andean colonial adventurer and the
Dutch commercial and financial houses did wield important imperial
functions. These rebels, like the earlier Roman and Turkish
guards, wanted to free themselves of the spiritual indignity and
material burden of serving the Emperor; they already wielded the
Emperor's powers; the Emperor was nothing more to them than a
parasite.
</p><p>
Colonial adventurer Aguirre was apparently inept as a rebel; his
time had not yet come.
</p><p>
The Dutch grandees were not inept, and their time had come. They
did not overthrow the empire; they rationalized it. The Dutch
commercial and financial houses already possessed much of the New
World's wealth; they had received it as payment for provisioning
the Emperor's fleets, armies and household. They now set out to
plunder colonies in their own name and for their own benefit,
unshackled by a parasitic overlord. And since they were not
Catholics but Calvinist Protestants, they were not embarrassed by
any contradiction between professions and acts. They made no
profession of saving souls. Their Calvinism told them that an
inscrutable God had saved or damned all souls at the beginning of
Time and no Dutch priest could alter God's plan.
</p><p>
The Dutch were not crusaders; they confined themselves to
unheroic, humorless, and businesslike plunder, calculated and
regularized; the plundering fleets departed and returned on
schedule. The fact that the plundered aliens were unbelievers
became less important than the fact that they were not Dutchmen.
</p><p>
West Eurasian forerunners of nationalism coined the term savages.
This term was a synonym for the east Eurasian Celestial Empire's
term barbarians. Both terms designated human beings as legitimate
prey.
</p><p class="subtitle">
                               * * *
</p><p>
During the following two centuries, the invasions, subjugations
and expropriations initiated by the Hapsburgs were imitated by
other European royal houses.
</p><p>
Seen through the lenses of nationalist historians, the initial
colonizers as well as their later imitators look like nations:
Spain, Holland, England, France. But seen from a vantage point in
the past, the colonizing powers are Hapsburgs, Tudors, Stuarts,
Bourbons, Oranges - namely dynasties identical to the dynastic
families that had been feuding for wealth and power ever since the
fall of the western Roman empire. The invaders can be seen from
both vantage points because a transition was taking place. The
entities were no longer mere feudal estates, but they were not yet
full-fledged nations; they already possessed some, but not yet
all, the attributes of a nation-state. The most notable missing
element was the national army. Tudors and Bourbons already
manipulated the Englishness or Frenchness of their subjects,
especially during wars against another monarch's subjects. But
neither Scots and Irishmen, not Corsicans and Provencals, were
recruited to fight and die for “the love of their country”. War
was an onerous feudal burden, a corvée; the only patriots were
patriots of Eldorado.
</p><p>
The tenets of what was going to become the nationalist creed did
not appeal to the ruling dynasts, who clung to their own tried and
tested tenets. The new tenets appealed to the dynast's higher
servants, his money-lenders, spice-vendors, military suppliers and
colony-plunderers. These people, like Lope de Aguirre and the
Dutch grandees, like earlier Roman and Turkish guards, wielded key
functions yet remained servants. Many if not most of them burned
to shake off the indignity and the burden, to rid themselves of
the parasitic overlord, to carry on the exploitation of countrymen
and the plunder of colonials in their own name and for their own
benefit.
</p><p>
Later known as the bourgeoisie or the middle class, these people
had become rich and powerful since the days of the first westward-
bound fleets. A portion of their wealth had come from the
plundered colonies, as payment for the services they had sold to
the Emperor; this sum of wealth would later be called a primitive
accumulation of capital. Another portion of their wealth had come
from the plunder of their own local countrymen and neighbors by a
method later known as capitalism; the method was not altogether
new, but it became very widespread after the middle classes got
their hands on the New World's silver and gold.
</p><p>
These middle classes wielded important powers, but they were not
yet experienced in wielding the central political power. In
England they overthrew a monarch and proclaimed a commonwealth
but, fearing that the popular energies they had mobilized against
the upper class could turn against the middle class, they soon
restored another monarch of the same dynastic house.
</p><p>
Nationalism did not really come into its own until the late 1700s
when two explosions, thirteen years apart, reversed the relative
standing of the two upper classes and permanently changed the
political geography of the globe. In 1776, colonial merchants and
adventurers re-enacted Aguirre's feat of proclaiming their
independence from the ruling overseas dynast, outdid their
predecessor by mobilizing their fellow-settlers, and succeeded in
severing themselves from the Hanoverian British Empire. And in
1789, enlightened merchants and scribes outdid their Dutch
forerunners by mobilizing, not a few outlying provinces, but the
entire subject population, by overthrowing and slaying the ruling
Bourbon monarch, and by remaking all feudal bonds into national
bonds. These two events marked the end of an era. Henceforth even
the surviving dynasts hastily or gradually became nationalists,
and the remaining royal estates took on ever more of the
attributes of nation-states.
</p><p class="subtitle">
                               * * *
</p><p>
The two eighteenth century revolutions were very different, and
they contributed different and even conflicting elements to the
creed and practice of nationalism. I do not intend to analyze
these events here, but only to remind the reader of some of the
elements.
</p><p>
Both rebellions successfully broke the bonds of fealty to a
monarchic house, and both ended with the establishment of
capitalist nation-states, but between the first act and the last
they had little in common. The main animators of both revolts were
familiar with the rationalistic doctrines of the Enlightenment,
but the self-styled Americans confined themselves to political
problems, largely to the problem of establishing a state machinery
that could take up where King George left off. Many of the French
went much further; they posed the problem of restructuring not
only the state but all of society; they challenged not only the
bond of subject to monarch, but also the bond of slave to master,
a bond that remained sacred to the Americans. Both groups were
undoubtedly familiar with Jean-Jacques Rousseau's observation that
human beings were born free, yet everywhere were bound in chains,
but the French understood the chains more profoundly and made a
greater effort to break them.
</p><p>
As influenced by rationalistic doctrines as Rousseau himself had
been, French revolutionaries tried to apply social reason to the
human environment in the same way that natural reason, or science,
was starting to be applied to the natural environment. Rousseau
had worked at his desk; he had tried to establish social justice
on paper, by entrusting human affairs to an entity that embodied
the general will. The revolutionaries agitated to establish social
justice not only on paper, but in the midst of mobilized and armed
human beings, many of them enraged, most of them poor.
</p><p>
Rousseau's abstract entity took the concrete form of a Committee
of Public Safety (or Public Health), a police organization that
considered itself the embodiment of the general will. The virtuous
committee members conscientiously applied the findings of reason
to human affairs. They considered themselves the nation's
surgeons. They carved their personal obsessions into society by
means of the state's razor blade.
</p><p>
The application of science to the environment took the form of
systematic terror. The instrument of Reason and Justice was the
guillotine.
</p><p>
The Terror decapitated the former rulers and then turned on the
revolutionaries.
</p><p>
Fear stimulated a reaction that swept away the Terror as well as
the Justice. The mobilized energy of bloodthirsty patriots was
sent abroad, to impose enlightenment on foreigners by force, to
expand the nation into an empire. The provisioning of national
armies was far more lucrative than the provisioning of feudal
armies ever had been, and former revolutionaries became rich and
powerful members of the middle class, which was now the top class,
the ruling class. The terror as well as the wars bequeathed a
fateful legacy to the creed and practice of later nationalisms.
</p><p>
The legacy of the American revolution was of an altogether
different kind. The Americans were less concerned with justice,
more concerned with property.
</p><p>
The settler-invaders on the northern continent's eastern shore
needed George of Hanover no more urgently then Lope de Aguirre had
needed Philip of Hapsburg. Or rather, the rich and powerful among
the settlers needed King George's apparatus to protect their
wealth, but not to gain it. If they could organize a repressive
apparatus on their own, they would not need King George at all.
</p><p>
Confident of their ability to launch an apparatus of their own,
the colonial slave-holders, land-speculators, produce-exporters
and bankers found the King's taxes and acts intolerable. The most
intolerable of the King's acts was the act that temporarily banned
unauthorized incursions into the lands of the continent's original
inhabitants; the King's advisers had their eyes on the animal furs
supplied by indigenous hunters; the revolutionary land-speculators
had theirs on the hunters' lands.
</p><p>
Unlike Aguirre, the federated colonizers of the north succeeded in
establishing their own independent repressive apparatus, and they
did this by stirring up a minimum of cravings for justice; their
aim was to overthrow the King's power, not their own. Rather than
rely excessively on their less fortunate fellow-settlers or
backwoods squatters, not to speak of their slaves, these
revolutionaries relied on mercenaries and on indispensable aid
from the Bourbon monarch who would be overthrown a few years later
by more virtuous revolutionaries.
</p><p>
The North American colonizers broke the traditional bonds of
fealty and feudal obligation but, unlike the French, they only
gradually replaced the traditional bonds with bonds of patriotism
and nationhood. They were not quite a nation; their reluctant
mobilization of the colonial countryside had not fused them into
one, and the multi-lingual, multi-cultural and socially divided
underlying population resisted such a fusion. The new repressive
apparatus was not tried and tested, and it did not command the
undivided loyalty of the underlying population, which was not yet
patriotic. Something else was needed. Slave-masters who had
overthrown their king feared that their slaves could similarly
overthrow the masters; the insurrection in Haiti made this fear
less than hypothetical. And although they no longer feared being
pushed into the sea by the continent's indigenous inhabitants, the
traders and speculators worried about their ability to thrust
further into the continent's interior.
</p><p>
The American settler-invaders had recourse to an instrument that
was not, like the guillotine, a new invention, but that was just
as lethal. This instrument would later be called Racism, and it
would become embedded in nationalist practice. Racism, like later
products of practical Americans, was a pragmatic principle; its
content was not important; what mattered was the fact that it
worked.
</p><p>
Human beings were mobilized in terms of their lowest and most
superficial common denominator, and they responded. People who had
abandoned their villages and families, who were forgetting their
languages and losing their cultures, who were all but depleted of
their sociability, were manipulated into considering their skin
color a substitute for all they had lost. They were made proud of
something that was neither a personal feat nor even, like
language, a personal acquisition. They were fused into a nation of
white men. (White women and children existed only as scalped
victims, as proofs of the bestiality of the hunted prey.) The
extent of the depletion is revealed by the nonentities the white
men shared with each other: white blood, white thoughts, and
membership in a white race. Debtors, squatters and servants, as
white men, had everything in common with bankers, land speculators
and plantation owners, nothing in common with Redskins, Blackskins
or Yellowskins. Fused by such a principle, they could also be
mobilized by it, turned into white mobs. Lynch mobs, “Indian
fighters”.
</p><p>
Racism had initially been one among several methods of mobilizing
colonial armies, and although it was exploited more fully in
America than it ever had been before, it did not supplant the
other methods but rather supplemented them. The victims of the
invading pioneers were still described as unbelievers, as heathen.
But the pioneers, like the earlier Dutch, were largely Protestant
Christians, and they regarded heathenism as something to be
punished, not remedied. The victims also continued to be
designated as savages, cannibals and primitives, but these terms,
too, ceased to be diagnoses of conditions that could be remedied,
and tended to become synonyms of non-white, a condition that could
not be remedied. Racism was an ideology perfectly suited to a
practice of enslavement and extermination.
</p><p>
The lynch-mob approach, the ganging-up on victims defined as
inferior, appealed to bullies whose humanity was stunted and who
lacked any notion of fair play. But this approach did not appeal
to everyone. American businessmen, part hustlers and part
confidence men, always had something for everyone. For the
numerous Saint Georges with some notion of honor and great thirst
for heroism, the enemy was depicted somewhat differently; for them
there were nations as rich and powerful as their own in the trans-
montane woodlands and on the shores of the Great Lakes.
</p><p>
The celebrants of the heroic feats of imperial Spaniards had found
empires in central Mexico and on top of the Andes. The celebrants
of nationalist American heroes found nations; they transformed
desperate resistances of anarchic villagers into international
conspiracies masterminded by military archons such as General
Pontiac and General Tecumseh; they peopled the woodlands with
formidable national leaders, efficient general staffs, and armies
of uncountable patriotic troops; they projected their own
repressive structures into the unknown; they saw an exact copy of
themselves, with all the colors reversed - something like a
photographic negative. The enemy thus became an equal in terms of
structure, power and aims. War against such an enemy was not only
fair play; it was a dire necessity, a matter of life and death.
The enemy's other attributes - the heathenism, the savagery, the
cannibalism - made the tasks of expropriating, enslaving and
exterminating all the more urgent, made these feats all the more
heroic.
</p><p>
The repertory of the nationalist program was now more or less
complete. This statement might baffle a reader who cannot yet see
any “real nations” in the field. The United States was still a
collection of multilingual, multi-religious and multi-cultural
“ethnicities”, and the French nation had overflowed its boundaries
and turned itself into a Napoleonic empire. The reader might be
trying to apply a definition of a nation as an organized territory
consisting of people who share a common language, religion and
customs, or at least one of the three. Such a definition, clear,
pat and static, is not a description of the phenomenon but an
apology for it, a justification. The phenomenon was not a static
definition but a dynamic process. The common language, religion
and customs, like the white blood of the American colonizers, were
mere pretexts, instruments for mobilizing armies. The culmination
of the process was not an enshrinement of the commonalities, but a
depletion, a total loss of language, religion and customs; the
inhabitants of a nation spoke the language of capital, worshipped
on the altar of the state and confined their customs to those
permitted by the national police.
</p><p class="subtitle">
                               * * *
</p><p>
Nationalism is the opposite of imperialism only in the realm of
definitions. In practice, nationalism was a methodology for
conducting the empire of capital.
</p><p>
The continual increase of capital, often referred to as material
progress, economic development or industrialization, was the main
activity of the middle classes, the so-called bourgeoisie, because
capital was what they owned, it was their property; the upper
classes owned estates.
</p><p>
The discovery of new worlds of wealth had enormously enriched
these middle classes, but had also made them vulnerable. The kings
and nobles who initially gathered the new world's plundered wealth
resented losing all but a few trophies to their middle class
merchants. This could not be helped. The wealth did not arrive in
usable forms; the merchants supplied the king with things he could
use, in exchange for the plundered treasures. Even so, monarchs
who saw themselves grow poor while their merchants grew rich were
not above using their armed retainers to plunder the wealthy
merchants. Consequently the middle classes suffered continual
injuries under the old regime - injuries to their property. The
king's army and police were not reliable protectors of middle
class property, and the powerful merchants, who already operated
the business of the empire, took measures to put an end to the
instability; they took the politics in hand as well. They could
have hired private armies, and they often did. But as soon as
instruments for mobilizing national armies and national police
forces appeared on the horizon, the injured businessmen had
recourse to them. The main virtue of a national armed force is
that it guarantees that a patriotic servant will war alongside his
own boss against an enemy boss's servant.
</p><p>
The stability assured by a national repressive apparatus gave the
owners something like a hothouse in which their capital could
grow, increase, multiply. The term “grow” and its corollaries come
from the capitalists' own vocabulary. These people think of a unit
of capital as a grain or seed which they invest in fertile soil.
In spring they see a plant grow from each seed. In summer they
harvest so many seeds from each plant that, after paying for the
soil, sunshine and rain, they still have more seeds than they had
initially. The following year they enlarge their field, and
gradually the whole countryside becomes improved. In reality, the
initial “grains” are money; the sunshine and rain are the expended
energies of laborers; the plants are factories, workshops and
mines, the harvested fruits are commodities, bits of processed
world; and the excess or additional grains, the profits, are
emoluments which the capitalist keeps for himself instead of
dividing them up among the workers.
</p><p>
The process as a whole consisted of the processing of natural
substances into saleable items or commodities, and of the
incarceration of wage workers in the processing plants.
</p><p>
The marriage of Capital with Science was responsible for the great
leap forward into what we live in today. Pure scientists
discovered the components into which the natural environment could
be decomposed; investors placed their bets on the various methods
of decomposition; applied scientists or managers saw to it that
the wage workers in their charge carried the project through.
Social scientists sought ways to make the workers less human, more
efficient and machine-like. Thanks to science, capitalists were
able to transform much of the natural environment into a processed
world, an artifice, and to reduce most human beings into efficient
tenders of the artifice.
</p><p>
The process of capitalist production was analyzed and criticized
by many philosophers and poets, most notably by Karl Marx(1), whose
critiques animated, and continue to animate, militant social
movements. Marx had a significant blind spot; most of his
disciples, and many militants who were not his disciples, built
their platforms on that blind spot. Marx was an enthusiastic
supporter of the bourgeoisie's struggle for liberation from feudal
bonds. Who was not an enthusiast in those days? He, who observed
that the ruling ideas of an epoch were the ideas of the ruling
class, shared many of the ideas of the newly empowered middle
class. He was an enthusiast of the Enlightenment, of rationalism,
of material progress. It was Marx who insightfully pointed out
that every time a worker reproduced his labor power, every minute
he devoted to his assigned task, he enlarged the material and
social apparatus that dehumanized him. Yet the same Marx was an
enthusiast for the application of science to production.
</p><p>
Marx made a thorough analysis of the production process as an
exploitation of labor, but he made only cursory and reluctant
comments about the prerequisite for capitalist production, and the
initial capital that made the process possible(2). Without the
initial capital, there could have been no investments, no
production, no great leap forward. This prerequisite was analyzed
by the early Soviet Russian marxist Preobrazhensky, who borrowed
several insights from the Polish marxist Rosa Luxemburg to
formulate his theory of primitive accumulation(3). By primitive,
Preobrazhensky meant the basement of the capitalist edifice, the
foundation, the prerequisite. This prerequisite cannot emerge from
the capitalist production process itself, if that process is not
yet under way. It must, and does, come from outside the production
process. It comes from the plundered colonies. It comes from the
expropriated and exterminated populations of the colonies. In
earlier days, when there were no overseas colonies, the first
capital, the prerequisite for capitalist production, had been
squeezed out of internal colonies, out of plundered peasants whose
lands were enclosed and crops requisitioned, out of expelled Jews
and Muslims whose possessions were expropriated.
</p><p>
The primitive or preliminary accumulation of capital is not
something that happened once, in the distant past, and never
after. It is something that continues to accompany the capitalist
production process, and is an integral part of it. The process
described by Marx is responsible for the regular profits are
periodically destroyed by crises endemic to the system; new
injections of preliminary capital are the only known cure to the
crises. Without an ongoing primitive accumulation of capital, the
production process would stop; each crisis would tend to become
permanent.
</p><p>
Genocide, the rationally calculated extermination of human
populations designated as legitimate prey, has not been an
aberration in an otherwise peaceful march of progress. Genocide
has been a prerequisite of that progress. This is why national
armed forces were indispensable to the wielders of capital. These
forces did not only protect the owners of capital from the
insurrectionary wrath of their own exploited wage workers. These
forces also captured the holy grail, the magic lantern, the
preliminary capital, by battering the gates of resisting or
unresisting outsiders, by looting, deporting and murdering.
</p><p>
The footprints of the national armies are the traces of the march
of progress. These patriotic armies were, and still are, the
seventh wonder of the world. In them, the wolf lay alongside the
lamb, the spider alongside the fly. In them, exploited workers
were the chums of exploiters, indebted peasants the chums of
creditors, suckers the chums of hustlers in a companionship
stimulated not by love but by hatred - hatred of potential sources
of preliminary capital designated as unbelievers, savages,
inferior races.
</p><p>
Human communities as variegated in their ways and beliefs as birds
are in feathers were invaded, despoiled and at last exterminated
beyond imagination's grasp. The clothes and artefacts of the
vanished communities were gathered up as trophies and displayed in
museums as additional traces of the march of progress; the extinct
beliefs and ways became the curiosities of yet another of the
invaders' many sciences. The expropriated fields, forests and
animals were garnered as bonanzas, as preliminary capital, as the
precondition for the production process that was to turn the
fields into farms, the trees into lumber, the animals into hats,
the minerals into munitions, the human survivors into cheap labor.
Genocide was, and still is, the precondition, the cornerstone and
ground work of the military-industrial complexes, of the processed
environments, of the worlds of offices and parking lots.

</p><p>
Nationalism was so perfectly suited to its double task, the
domestication of workers and the despoliation of aliens, that it
appealed to everyone - everyone, that is, who wielded or aspired
to wield a portion of capital.
</p><p>
During the nineteenth century, especially during its second half,
every owner of investable capital discovered that he had roots
among the mobilizable countryfolk who spoke his mother's tongue
and worshipped his father's gods. The fervor of such a nationalist
was transparently cynical, since he was the countryman who no
longer had roots among his mother's or father's kin: he found his
salvation in his savings, prayed to his investments and spoke the
language of cost accounting. But he had learned, from Americans
and Frenchmen, that although he could not mobilize the countryfolk
as loyal servants, clients and customers, he could mobilize them
as loyal fellow-Catholics, Orthodox or Protestants. Languages,
religions and customs became welding materials for the
construction of nation-states.
</p><p>
The welding materials were means, not ends. The purpose of the
national entities was not to develop languages, religions or
customs, but to develop national economies, to turn the
countryfolk into workers and soldiers, to turn the motherland into
mines and factories, to turn dynastic estates into capitalist
enterprises. Without the capital, there could be no munitions or
supplies, no national army, no nation.
</p><p>
Savings and investments, market research and cost accounting, the
obsessions of the rationalistic former middle classes, became the
ruling obsessions. These rationalistic obsessions became not only
sovereign but also exclusive. Individuals who enacted other
obsessions, irrational ones, were put away in madhouses, asylums.
</p><p>
The nations usually were but need no longer have been
monotheistic; the former god or gods had lost their importance
except as welding materials. The nations were mono-obsessive, and
if monotheism served the ruling obsession, then it too was
mobilized.
</p><p>
World War I marked the end of one phase of the nationalizing
process, the phase that had begun with the American and French
revolutions, the phase that had been announced much earlier by the
declaration of Aguirre and the revolt of the Dutch grandees. The
conflicting claims of old and newly-constituted nations were in
fact the causes of that war. Germany, Italy and Japan, as well as
Greece, Serbia and colonial Latin America, had already taken on
most of the attributes of their nationalistic predecessors, had
become national empires, monarchies and republics, and the more
powerful of the new arrivals aspired to take on the main missing
attribute, the colonial empire. During that war, all the
mobilizable components of the two remaining dynastic empires, the
Ottoman and the Hapsburg, constituted themselves into nations.
When bourgeoisies with different languages and religions, such as
Turks and Armenians, claimed the same territory, the weaker were
treated like so-called American Indians; they were exterminated.
National Sovereignty and Genocide were - and still are -
corollaries.
</p><p>
Common language and religion appear to be corollaries of
nationhood, but only because of an optical illusion. As welding
materials, languages and religions were used when they served
their purpose, discarded when they did not. Neither multi-lingual
Switzerland nor multi-religious Yugoslavia were banned from the
family of nations. The shapes of noses and the color of hair could
also have been used to mobilize patriots - and later were. The
shared heritages, roots and commonalities had to satisfy only one
criterion, the criterion of American-style pragmatic reason: did
they work? Whatever worked was used. The shared traits were
important, not because of their cultural, historical or
philosophical content, but because they were useful for organizing
a police to protect the national property and for mobilizing an
army to plunder the colonies.
</p><p>
Once a nation was constituted, human beings who lived on the
national territory but did not possess the national traits could
be transformed into internal colonies, namely into sources of
preliminary capital. Without preliminary capital, no nation could
become a great nation, and nations that aspired to greatness but
lacked adequate overseas colonies could resort to plundering,
exterminating and expropriating those of their countrymen who did
not possess the national traits.
</p><p class="subtitle">
                               * * *
</p><p>
The establishment of nation-states was greeted with euphoric
enthusiasm by poets as well as peasants who thought their muses or
their gods had at last descended to earth. The main wet blankets
amidst the waving banners and flying confetti were the former
rulers, the colonized, and the disciples of Karl Marx.
</p><p>
The overthrown and the colonized were unenthusiastic for obvious
reasons.
</p><p>
The disciples of Marx were unenthusiastic because they had learned
from the master that national liberation meant national
exploitation, that the national government was the executive
committee of the national capitalist class, that the nation had
nothing for workingmen but chains. These strategists for the
workingmen, who were not themselves workingmen but were as
bourgeois as the ruling capitalists, proclaimed that the
workingmen had no country and organized themselves into an
International. This International split into three, and each
International moved increasingly into the field of Marx's blind
spot.
</p><p>
The First International was carried off by Marx's one-time Russian
translator and then antagonist Bakunin, an inveterate rebel who
had been a fervent nationalist until he'd learned about
exploitation from Marx. Bakunin and his companions, rebels against
all authorities, also rebelled against the authority of Marx; they
suspected Marx of trying to turn the International into a state as
repressive as the feudal and national combined. Bakunin and his
followers were unambiguous in their rejection of all states, but
they were ambiguous about capitalist enterprise. Even more than
Marx, they glorified science, celebrated material progress and
hailed industrialization. Being rebels, they considered every
fight a good fight, but the best of all was the fight against the
bourgeoisie's former enemies, the fight against feudal landlords
and the Catholic Church. Thus the Bakuninist International
flourished in places like Spain, where the bourgeoisie had not
completed its struggle for independence but had, instead, allied
itself with feudal barons and the Church for protection from
insurgent workers and peasants. The Bakuninists fought to complete
the bourgeois revolution without and against the bourgeoisie. They
called themselves anarchists and disdained all states, but did not
begin to explain how they would procure the preliminary or the
subsequent industry, progress and science, namely the capital,
without an army and a police. They were never given a real chance
to resolve their contradiction in practice, and present day
Bakuninists have still not resolved it, have not even become aware
that there is a contradiction between anarchy and industry.
</p><p>
The Second International, less rebellious than the first, quickly
came to terms with capital as well as the state. Solidly
entrenched in Marx's blind spot, the professors of this
organization did not become enmeshed in any Bakuninist
contradiction. It was obvious to them that the exploitation and
the plunder were necessary conditions for the material progress,
and they realistically reconciled themselves to what could not be
helped. All they asked for was a greater share of the benefits for
the workingmen, and offices in the political establishment for
themselves, as the workingmen's representatives. Like the good
unionists who preceded and followed them, the socialist professors
were embarrassed by “the colonial question”, but their
embarrassment, like Philip Hapsburg's, merely gave them bad
consciences. In time, imperial German socialists, royal Danish
socialists and republican French socialists even ceased to be
internationalists.
</p><p>
The Third International did not only come to terms with capital
and the state; it made them its goal. This international was not
formed by rebellious or dissenting intellectuals; it was created
by a state, the Russian state, after the Bolshevik Party installed
itself in that state's offices. The main activity of this
international was to advertise the feats of the revamped Russian
state, of its ruling party, and of the party's founder, a man who
called himself Lenin. The feats of that party and founder were
indeed momentous, but the advertisers did their best to hide what
was most momentous about them.
</p><p class="subtitle">
                               * * *
</p><p>
The first world war had left two vast empires in a quandary. The
Celestial Empire of China, the oldest continuous state in the
world, and the Empire of the Tsars, a much more recent operation,
hovered shakily between the prospect of turning themselves into
nation-states and the prospect of decomposing into smaller units,
like their Ottoman and Hapsburg counterparts had done.
</p><p>
Lenin resolved this quandary for Russia. Is such a thing possible?
Marx had observed that a single individual could not change
circumstances; he could only avail himself of them. Marx was
probably right. Lenin's feat was not to change circumstances, but
to avail himself of them in an extraordinary manner. The feat was
monumental in its opportunism.
</p><p>
Lenin was a Russian bourgeois who cursed the weakness and
ineptitude of the Russian bourgeoisie(4). An enthusiast for
capitalist development, an ardent admirer of American-style
progress, he did not make common cause with those he cursed, but
rather with their enemies, with the Anti-capitalist disciples of
Marx. He availed himself of Marx's blind spot to transform Marx's
critique of the capitalist production process into a manual for
developing capital, a "how-to-do-it" guide. Marx's studies of
exploitation and immiseration became food for the famished, a
cornucopia, a virtual horn of plenty. American businessmen had
already marketed urine as spring water, but no American confidence
man had yet managed an inversion of such magnitude.
</p><p>
No circumstances were changed. Every step of the inversion was
carried out with available circumstances, with tried and tested
methods. Russian countryfolk could not be mobilized in terms of
their Russianness or orthodoxy or whiteness, but they could be,
and were, mobilized in terms of their exploitation, their
oppression, their ages of suffering under the despotism of the
Tsars. Oppression and exploitation became welding materials. The
long sufferings under the Tsars were used in the same way and for
the same purpose as the scalpings of white women and children had
been used by Americans; they were used to organize people into
fighting units, into embryos of the national army and the national
police.
</p><p>
The presentation of the dictator and of the Party's central
committee as a dictatorship of the liberated proletariat seemed to
be something new, but even this was new only in the words that
were used. This was something as old as the Pharaohs and Lugals of
ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, who had been chosen by the god to
lead the people, who had embodied the people in their dialogues
with the god. This was a tried and tested gimmick of rulers. Even
if the ancient precedents were temporarily forgotten, a more
recent precedent had been provided by the French Committee of
Public Health, which had presented itself as the embodiment of the
nation's general will.
</p><p>
The goal, communism, the overthrow and supersession of capitalism,
also seemed something new, seemed to be a change of circumstances.
But only the word was new. the goal of the dictator of the
proletariat was still American-style progress, capitalist
development, electrification, rapid mass transportation, science,
the processing of the natural environment. The goal was the
capitalism that the weak and inept Russian bourgeoisie had failed
to develop. With Marx's Capital as their light and guide, the
dictator and his Party would develop capitalism in Russia; they
would serve as a substitute bourgeoisie, and they would use the
power of the state not only to police the process, but to launch
and manage it as well.
</p><p>
Lenin did not live long enough to demonstrate his virtuosity as
general manager of Russian capital, but his successor Stalin amply
demonstrated the powers of the founder's machine. The fist step
was the primitive accumulation of capital. If Marx had not been
very clear about this, Preobrazhensky had been very clear.
Preobrazhensky was jailed, but his description of the tried and
tested methods of procuring preliminary capital was applied to
vast Russia. The preliminary capital of English, American, Belgian
and other capitalists had come from plundered overseas colonies.
Russia had no overseas colonies. This lack was no obstacle. The
entire Russian countryside was transformed into a colony.
</p><p>
The first sources of preliminary capital were Kulaks, peasants who
had something worth plundering. This drive was so successful that
it was applied to the remaining peasants as well, with the
rational expectation that small amounts plundered from many people
would yield a substantial hoard.
</p><p>
The peasants were not the only colonials. The former ruling class
had already been thoroughly expropriated of all its wealth and
property, but yet other sources of preliminary capital were found.
With the totality of state power concentrated in their hands, the
dictators soon discovered that they could manufacture sources of
primitive accumulation. Successful entrepreneurs, dissatisfied
workers and peasants, militants of competing organizations, even
disillusioned Party Members, could be designated as counter-
revolutionaries, rounded up, expropriated and shipped off to labor
camps. All the deportations, mass executions and expropriations of
earlier colonizers were re-enacted in Russia.
</p><p>
Earlier colonizers, being pioneers, had resorted to trial and
error. The Russian dictators did not have to resort to trial and
error. By their time, all the methods of procuring preliminary
capital had been tried and tested, and could be scientifically
applied. Russian capital developed in a totally controlled
environment, a hothouse; every lever, every variable, was
controlled by the national police. Functions which had been left
to chance or to other bodies in less controlled environments fell
to the police in the Russian hothouse. The fact that the colonials
were not abroad but within, and therefore subject not to conquest
but to arrest, further increased the role and size of the police.
In time the omnipotent and omnipresent police became the visible
emanation and embodiment of the proletariat, and communism became
a synonym of total police organization and control.
</p><p class="subtitle">
                               * * *
</p><p>
Lenin's expectations were not, however, fully realized by the
Russian hothouse. The police-as-capitalist worked wonders in
procuring preliminary capital from expropriated counter-
revolutionaries, but did not do nearly as well in managing the
capitalist production process. It may still be too early to tell
for sure, but to date this police bureaucracy had been at least as
inept in this role as the bourgeoisie Lenin had cursed; its
ability to discover ever new sources of preliminary capital seems
to be all that has kept it afloat.
</p><p>
Nor has the appeal of this apparatus been on a level with Lenin's
expectations. The Leninist police apparatus has not appealed to
businessmen or to established politicians; it has not recommended
itself as a superior method of managing the production process. It
has appealed to a somewhat different social class, a class I will
briefly try to describe, and it has recommended itself to this
class primarily as a method of seizing national power and
secondarily as a method of primitive accumulation of capital.
</p><p>
The heirs of Lenin and Stalin have not been actual Praetorian
guards, actual wielders of economic and political power in the
name and for the benefit of a superfluous monarch; they have been
understudy Praetorians, students of economic and political power
who despaired of ever reaching even intermediate levels of power.
The Leninist model has offered such people the prospect of leaping
over the intermediate levels directly into the central palace.
</p><p>
The heirs of Lenin were clerks and minor officials, people like
Mussolini, Mao Zedong and Hitler, people who, like Lenin himself,
cursed their weak and inept bourgeoisies for having failed to
establish their nation's greatness.
</p><p>
(I do not include the Zionists among the heirs of Lenin because
they belong to an earlier generation. They were Lenin's
contemporaries who had, perhaps independently, discovered the
power of persecution and suffering as welding materials for the
mobilization of a national army and police. The Zionists made
other contributions of their own. Their treatment of a dispersed
religious population as a nation, their imposition of the
capitalist nation-state as that population's end-all and be-all,
and their reduction of a religious heritage to a racial heritage,
contributed significant elements to the nationalist methodology,
and would have fateful consequences when they were applied on a
population of Jews, not all of them Zionists, by a population
welded together as a "German race".)
</p><p>
Mussolini, Mao Zedong and Hitler cut through the curtain of
slogans and saw Lenin's and Stalin's feats for what they were:
successful methods of seizing and maintaining state power. All
three trimmed the methodology down to its essentials. The first
step was to join up with likeminded students of power and to form
the nucleus of the police organization, an outfit called, after
Lenin's, the Party. The next step was to recruit the mass base,
the available troops and troop suppliers. The third step was to
seize the apparatus of the state, to install the theoretician in
the office of Duce, Chairman or Fuehrer, to apportion police and
managerial functions among the elite or cadre, and to put the mass
base to work. The fourth step was to secure the preliminary
capital needed to repair or launch a military-industrial complex
capable of supporting the national leader and cadre, the police
and army, the industrial managers; without this capital there
could be no weapons, no power, no nation.
</p><p>
The heirs of Lenin and Stalin further trimmed the methodology, in
their recruiting drives, by minimizing capitalist exploitation and
by concentrating on national oppression. Talk of exploitation no
longer served a purpose, and had in fact become embarrassing,
since it was obvious to all, especially to wage workers, that
successful revolutionaries had not put an end to wage labor, but
had extended its domain.
</p><p>
Being as pragmatic as American businessmen, the new
revolutionaries did not speak of liberation from wage labor, but
of national liberation(5). This type of liberation was not a dream
of romantic utopians; it was precisely what was possible, and all
that was possible, in the existing world, one needed only to avail
oneself of already existing circumstances to make it happen.
National liberation consisted of the liberation of the national
chairman and the national police from the chains of powerlessness;
the investiture of the chairman and the establishment of the
police were not pipe dreams but components of a tried and tested
strategy, a science.
</p><p>
Fascist and National Socialist Parties were the first to prove
that the strategy worked, that the Bolshevik Party's feat could
actually be repeated. The national chairmen and their staffs
installed themselves in power and set out to procure the
preliminary capital needed for national greatness. The Fascists
thrust themselves into one of the last uninvaded regions of Africa
and gouged it as earlier industrializers had gouged their colonial
empires. The National Socialists targeted Jews, an inner
population that had been members of a "unified Germany" as long as
other Germans, as their first source of primitive accumulation
because many of the Jews, like many of Stalin's Kulaks, had things
worth plundering.
</p><p>
Zionists had already preceded the National Socialists in reducing
a religion to a race, and National Socialists could look back to
American pioneers for ways to use the instrument of racism.
Hitler's elite needed only to translate the corpus of American
racist research to equip their scientific institutes with large
libraries. The National Socialists dealt with Jews much the same
way as the Americans had earlier dealt with the indigenous
population of North America, except that the National Socialists
applied a later and much more powerful technology to the task of
deporting, expropriating and exterminating human beings. But in
this the later exterminators were not innovators; they merely
availed themselves of the circumstances within their reach.
</p><p>
The Fascists and National Socialists were joined by Japanese
empire-builders who feared that the decomposing Celestial Empire
would become a source of preliminary capital for Russian or
revolutionary Chinese industrializers. Forming an Axis, the three
set out to turn the world's continents into sources of primitive
accumulation of capital. They were not bothered by other nations
until they started to encroach on the colonies and homelands of
established capitalist powers. The reduction of already
established capitalists to colonized prey could be practised
internally, where it was always legal since the nation's rulers
make its laws - and had already been practised internally by
Leninists and Stalinists. But such a practice would have amounted
to a change of circumstances, and it could not be carried abroad
without provoking a world war. The Axis powers overreached
themselves and lost.
</p><p>
After the war, many reasonable people would speak of the aims of
the Axis as irrational and of Hitler as a lunatic. Yet the same
reasonable people would consider men like George Washington and
Thomas Jefferson sane and rational, even though these men
envisioned and began to enact the conquest of a vast continent,
the deportation and extermination of the continent's population,
at a time when such a project was much less feasible than the
project of the Axis(6). It is true that the technologies as well as
the physical, chemical, biological and social sciences applied by
Washington and Jefferson were quite different from those applied
by the National Socialists. But if knowledge is power, if it was
rational for the earlier pioneers to maim and kill with gunpowder
in the age of horse-drawn carriages, why was it irrational for
National Socialists to maim and kill with high explosives, gas and
chemical agents in the age of rockets, submarines and "freeways"?
</p><p>
The Nazis were, if anything, yet more scientifically-oriented than
the Americans. In their time, they were a synonym for scientific
efficiency to much of the world. They kept files on everything,
tabulated and cross tabulated their findings, published their
tabulations in scientific journals. Among them, even racism was
not the property of frontier rabble-rousers, but of well-endowed
institutes.
</p><p>
Many reasonable people seem to equate lunacy with failure. This
would not be the first time. Many called Napoleon a lunatic when
he was in prison or in exile, but when Napoleon re-emerged as the
Emperor, the same people spoke of him with respect, even
reverence. Incarceration and exile are not only regarded as
remedies for lunacy, but also as its symptoms. Failure is
foolishness.
</p><p class="subtitle">
                               * * *
</p><p>
Mao Zedong, the third pioneering national socialist (or national
communist; the second word no longer matters, since it is nothing
but a historical relic; the expression “left-wing fascist” would
serve as well, but it conveys even less meaning than the
nationalist expressions) succeeded in doing for the Celestial
Empire what Lenin had done for the Empire of the Tsars. The oldest
bureaucratic apparatus in the world did not decompose into smaller
units nor into colonies of other industrializers; it re-emerged,
greatly changed, as a People's Republic, as a beacon to “oppressed
nations”.
</p><p>
The Chairman and his Cadre followed the footsteps of a long line
of predecessors and transformed the Celestial Empire into a vast
source of preliminary capital, complete with purges, persecutions
and their consequent great leaps forward.
</p><p>
The next stage, the launching of the capitalist production
process, was carried out on the Russian model, namely by the
national police. This did not work in China any better than it had
in Russia. Apparently the entrepreneurial function was to be
entrusted to confidence men or hustlers who are able to take other
people in, and cops do not usually inspire the required
confidence. But this was less important to Maoists than it had
been to Leninists. The capitalist production process remains
important, at least as important as the regularized drives for
primitive accumulation, since without the capital there is no
power, no nation. But the Maoists make few, and ever fewer, claims
for their model as a superior method of industrialization, and in
this they are more modest than the Russians and less disappointed
by the results of their industrial police.
</p><p>
The Maoist model offers itself to security guards and students the
world over as a tried and tested methodology of power, as a
scientific strategy of national liberation. Generally known as Mao-
Zedong-Thought(7), this science offers aspiring chairmen and cadres
the prospect of unprecedented power over living beings, human
activities and even thoughts. The pope and priests of the Catholic
Church, with all their inquisitions and confessions, never had
such power, not because they would have rejected it, but because
they lacked the instruments made available by modern science and
technology.
</p><p>
The liberation of the nation is the last stage in the elimination
of parasites. Capitalism and already earlier cleared nature of
parasites and reduced most of the rest of nature to raw materials
for processing industries. Modern national socialism or social
nationalism holds out the prospect of eliminating parasites from
human society as well. The human parasites are usually sources of
preliminary capital, but the capital is not always “material”; it
can also be cultural or “spiritual”. The ways, myths, poetry and
music of the people are liquidated as a matter of course; some of
the music and costumes of the former “folk culture” subsequently
reappear, processed and packaged, as elements of the national
spectacle, as decorations for the national accumulation drives;
the ways and myths become raw materials for processing by one or
several of the “human sciences”. Even the useless resentment of
workers toward their alienated wage labor is liquidated. When the
nation is liberated, wage labor ceases to be an onerous burden and
becomes a national obligation, to be carried out with joy. The
inmates of a totally liberated nation read Orwell's 1984 as an
anthropological study, a description of an earlier age.
</p><p>
It is no longer possible to satirize this state of affairs. Every
satire risks becoming a bible for yet another national liberation
front(8). Every satirist risks becoming the founder of a new
religion, a Buddha, Zarathustra, Jesus, Muhammad or Marx. Every
exposure of the ravages of the dominant system, every critique of
the system's functioning, becomes fodder for the horses of
liberators, welding materials for builders of armies. Mao-Zedong-
Thought in its numerous versions and revisions is a total science
as well as a total theology; it is social physics as well as
cosmic metaphysics. The French Committee of National Health
claimed to embody the general will of only the French nation. The
revisions of Mao-Zedong-Thought claim to embody the general will
of all the world's oppressed.
</p><p>
The constant revisions of this Thought are necessary because its
initial formulations were not applicable to all, or in fact to
any, of the world's colonized populations. None of the world's
colonized shared the Chinese heritage of having supported a state
apparatus for the past two thousand years. Few of the world's
oppressed had possessed any of the attributes of a nation in the
recent or distant past. The Thought had to be adapted to people
whose ancestors had lived without national chairmen, armies or
police, without capitalist production processes and therefore
without the need for preliminary capital.
</p><p>
These revisions were accomplished by enriching the initial Thought
with borrowings from Mussolini, Hitler and the Zionist state of
Israel. Mussolini's theory of the fulfilment of the nation in the
state was a central tenet. All groups of people, whether small or
large, industrial or non-industrial, concentrated or dispersed,
were seen as nations, not in terms of their past, but in terms of
their aura, their potentiality, a potentiality embedded in their
national liberation fronts. Hitler's (and the Zionists') treatment
of the nation as a racial entity was another central tenet. The
cadres were recruited from among people depleted of their
ancestors' kinships and customs, and consequently the liberators
were not distinguishable from the oppressors in terms of language,
beliefs, customs or weapons; the only welding material that held
them to each other and to their mass base was the welding material
that had held white servants to white bosses on the American
frontier; the “racial bond” gave identities to those without
identity, kinship to those who had no kin, community to those who
had lost their community; it was the last bond of the culturally
depleted.
</p><p class="subtitle">
                               * * *
</p><p>
The revised thought could now be applied to Africans as well as
Navahos, Apaches as well as Palestinians(9). The borrowings from
Mussolini, Hitler and the Zionists are judiciously covered up,
because Mussolini and Hitler failed to hold on to their seized
power, and because the successful Zionists have turned their state
into the world's policeman against all other national liberation
fronts. Lenin, Stalin and Mao Zedong must be given even more
credit than they deserve.
</p><p>
The revised and universally applicable models work much the same
as the originals, but more smoothly; national liberation has
become an applied science; the apparatus has been frequently
tested; the numerous kinks in the originals have by now been
straightened out. All that is needed to make the contraption run
is a driver, a transmission belt, and fuel.
</p><p>
The driver is of course the theoretician himself, or his closest
disciple. The transmission belt is the general staff, the
organization, also called the Party or the communist party. This
communist party with a small c is exactly what it is popularly
understood to be. It is the nucleus of the police organization
that does the purging and that will itself be purged once the
leader becomes National Leader and needs to re-revise the
invariant Thought while adapting himself to the family of nations,
or at least to the family bankers, munitions suppliers and
investors. And the fuel: the oppressed nation, the suffering
masses, the liberated people are and will continue to be the fuel.
</p><p>
The leader and the general staff are not flown in from abroad;
they are not foreign agitators. They are integral products of the
capitalist production process. This production process has
invariably been accompanied by racism. Racism is not a necessary
component of production, but racism (in some form) has been a
necessary component of the process of primitive accumulation of
capital, and it has almost always leaked into the production
process.
</p><p>
Industrialized nations have procured their preliminary capital by
expropriating, deporting, persecuting and segregating, if not
always by exterminating, people designated as legitimate prey.
Kinships were broken, environments were destroyed, cultural
orientations and ways were extirpated.
</p><p>
Descendants of survivors of such onslaughts are lucky if they
preserve the merest relics, the most fleeting shadows of their
ancestors' cultures. Many of the descendants do not retain even
shadows; they are totally depleted; they go to work; they further
enlarge the apparatus that destroyed their ancestors' culture. And
in the world of work they are relegated to the margins, to the
most unpleasant and least highly paid jobs. This makes them mad. A
supermarket packer, for example, may know more about the stocks
and the ordering than the manager, may know that racism is the
only reason he is not manager and the manager not a packer. A
security guard may know racism is the only reason he's not chief
of police. It is among people who have lost all their roots, who
dream themselves supermarket managers and chiefs of police, that
the national liberation front takes root; this is where the leader
and general staff are formed.
</p><p>
Nationalism continues to appeal to the depleted because other
prospects appear bleaker. The culture of the ancestors was
destroyed; therefore, by pragmatic standard, it failed; the only
ancestors who survived were those who accommodated themselves to
the invader's system, and they survived on the outskirts of
garbage dumps. The varied utopias of poets and dreamers and the
numerous "mythologies of the proletariat" have also failed; they
have not proven themselves in practice; they have been nothing but
hot air, pipe dreams, pies in the sky; the actual proletariat has
been as racist as the bosses and the police.
</p><p>
The packer and the security guard have lost contact with the
ancient culture; pipe dreams and utopias don't interest them, are
in fact dismissed with the practical businessman's contempt toward
poets, drifters and dreamers. Nationalism offers them something
concrete, something that's been tried and tested and is known to
work. There's no earthly reason for the descendants of the
persecuted to remain persecuted when nationalism offers them the
prospect of becoming persecutors. Near and distant relatives of
victims can become a racist nation-state; they can themselves herd
other people into concentration camps, push other people around at
will, perpetrate genocidal war against them, procure preliminary
capital by expropriating them. And if “racial relatives” of
Hitler's victims can do it, so can the near and distant relatives
of the victims of a Washington, Jackson, Reagan or Begin.
</p><p>
Every oppressed population can become a nation, a photographic
negative of the oppressor nation, a place where the former packer
is the supermarket's manager, where the former security guard is
the chief of police. By applying the corrected strategy, every
security guard can follow the precedent of ancient Rome's
Praetorian guards. The security police of a foreign mining trust
can proclaim itself a republic, liberate the people, and go on
liberating them until they have nothing left but to pray for
liberation to end. Even before the seizure of power, a gang can
call itself a Front and offer heavily taxed and constantly policed
poor people something they still lack: a tribute-gathering
organization and a hit-squad, namely supplementary tax farmers and
police, the people's own. In these ways, people can be liberated
of the traits of their victimized ancestors; all the relics that
still survive from pre-industrial times and non-capitalist
cultures can at last be permanently extirpated.
</p><p>
The idea that an understanding of the genocide, that a memory of
the holocausts, can only lead people to want to dismantle the
system, is erroneous. The continuing appeal of nationalism
suggests that the opposite is truer, namely that an understanding
of genocide has led people to mobilize genocidal armies, that the
memory of holocausts has led people to perpetrate holocausts. The
sensitive poets who remembered the loss, the researchers who
documented it, have been like the pure scientists who discovered
the structure of the atom. Applied scientists used the discovery
to split the atom's nucleus, to produce weapons which can split
every atom's nucleus; Nationalists used the poetry to split and
fuse human populations, to mobilize genocidal armies, to
perpetrate new holocausts.
</p><p>
The pure scientist, poets and researchers consider themselves
innocent of the devastated countrysides and charred bodies. Are
they innocent?
</p><p>
It seems to me that at least one of Marx's observations is true:
every minute devoted to the capitalist production process, every
thought contributed to the industrial system, further enlarges a
power that is inimical to nature, to culture, to life. Applied
science is not something alien; it is an integral part of the
capitalist production process. Nationalism is not flown in from
abroad. It is a product of the capitalist production process, like
the chemical agents poisoning the lakes, air, animals and people,
like the nuclear plants radioactivating micro-environments in
preparation for the radioactivation of the macro-environment.
</p><p>
As a postscript I'd like to answer a question before it is asked.
The question is: "Don't you think a descendant of oppressed people
is better off as a supermarket manager or police chief?" My answer
is another question: What concentration camp manager, national
executioner or torturer is not a descendant of oppressed people?

page 599: "if...we compare the present rapidity of development
with that which could be achieved with the general level of
technique and culture as it is today, the present rate of
development of capitalism in Russia really must be considered as
slow. And it cannot but be slow, for in no single capitalist
country has there been such an abundant survival of ancient
institutions that are incompatible with capitalism, retard its
development, and immeasurably worsen the condition of the
producers..."

myth is the greatness of the nation"; "It is the state which
creates the nation, conferring volition and therefore real life on
a people made aware of their moral unity"; "Always the maximum of
liberty coincides with the maximum force of the state";
"Everything for the state; nothing against the state; nothing
outside the state." From Che cosa A il fascismo and La dottrina

cause the savage, as the wolf, to retire; both being beast of
prey, tho' they differ in shape" (G. Washington in 1783). "...if
ever we are constrained to lift the hatchet against any tribe, we
will never lay it down till that tribe is exterminated, or driven
beyond..." (T. Jefferson in 1807). "...the cruel massacres they
have committed on the women and children of our frontiers taken by
surprise, will oblige us now to pursue them to extermination, or
drive them to new seats beyond our reach" (T. Jefferson in 1813).

8. Black & Red tried to satirize this situation over ten years ago
with the publication of a fake Manual for Revolutionary Leaders, a
"how-to-do-it guide" whose author, Michael Velli, offered to do
for the modern revolutionary prince what Machiavelli had offered
the feudal prince. This phoney "Manual" fused Mao-Zedong-Thought
with the Thought of Lenin, Stalin, Mussolini, Hitler and their
modern followers, and offered grizzly recipes for the preparation
of revolutionary organizations and the seizure of total power.
Disconcertingly, at least half of the requests for this "Manual"
came from aspiring national liberators, and it is possible that
some of the current versions of the nationalist metaphysic contain
recipes offered by Michael Velli.
</p><p>
9. I am not exaggerating. I have before me a book-length pamphlet
titled The Mythology of the White Proletariat: A Short Course for
Understanding Babylon by J. Sakai (Chicago: Morningstar Press,
1983). As an application of Mao-Zedong-Thought to American
history, it is the most sensitive Maoist work I've seen. The
author documents and describes, sometimes vividly, the oppression
of America's enslaved Africans, the deportations and
exterminations of the American continent's indigenous inhabitants,
the racist exploitation of Chinese, the incarceration of Japanese-
Americans in concentration camps. The author mobilizes all these
experiences of unmitigated terror, not to look for ways to
supersede the system that perpetrated them, but to urge the
victims to reproduce the same system among themselves. Sprinkled
with pictures and quotations of chairmen Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong
and Ho-chi Minh, this work makes no attempt to hide or disguise
its repressive aims; it urges Africans as well as Navahos, Apaches
as well as Palestinians, to organize a party, seize state power,
and liquidate parasites.
