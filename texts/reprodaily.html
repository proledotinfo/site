<p class="title">THE REPRODUCTION OF EVERYDAY LIFE</p>
<p class="author">by Fredy Perlman (1969)</p>
<p>The everyday practical activity of tribesmen 
  reproduces, or perpetuates, a tribe. This reproduction is not merely physical, 
  but social as well. Through their daily activities the tribesmen do not merely 
  reproduce a group of human beings; they reproduce a tribe, namely a particular 
  social form within which this group of human beings performs specific activities 
  in a specific manner. The specific activities of the tribesmen are not the outcome 
  of "natural" characteristics of the men who perform them, the way the production 
  of honey is an outcome of the "nature" of a bee. The daily life enacted and 
  perpetuated by the tribesman is a specific social response to particular material 
  and historical conditions.<br>
  <br>
  The everyday activity of slaves reproduces slavery. Through their daily activities, 
  slaves do not merely reproduce themselves and their masters physically; they 
  also reproduce the instruments with which the master represses them, and their 
  own habits of submission to the master's authority. To men who live in a slave 
  society, the master-slave relation seems like a natural and eternal relation. 
  However, men are not born masters or slaves. Slavery is a specific social form, 
  and men submit to it only in very particular material and historical conditions.<br>
  <br>
  The practical everyday activity of wage-workers reproduces wage labor and capital. 
  Through their daily activities, "modern" men, like tribesmen and slaves, reproduce 
  the inhabitants, the social relations and the ideas of their society; they reproduce 
  the social form of daily life. Like the tribe and the slave system, the capitalist 
  system is neither the natural nor the final form of human society; like the 
  earlier social forms, capitalism is a specific response to material and historical 
  conditions.<br>
  <br>
  Unlike earlier forms of social activity, everyday life in capitalist society 
  systematically transforms the material conditions to which capitalism originally 
  responded. Some of the material limits to human activity come gradually under 
  human control. At a high level of industrialization, practical activity creates 
  its own material conditions as well as its social form. Thus the subject of 
  analysis is not only how practical activity in capitalist society reproduces 
  capitalist society, but also how this activity itself eliminates the material 
  conditions to which capitalism is a response.</p>
  
  <p class="subtitle">Daily Life in Capitalist Society</p>
  
<p>The social form of people's regular activities under capitalism is a response 
  to a certain material and historical situation. The material and historical 
  conditions explain the origin of the capitalist form, but do not explain why 
  this form continues after the initial situation disappears. A concept of "cultural 
  lag" is not an explanation of the continuity of a social form after the disappearance 
  of the initial conditions to which it responded. This concept is merely a name 
  for the continuity of the social form. When the concept of "cultural lag" parades 
  as a name for a "social force" which determines human activity, it is an obfuscation 
  which presents the outcome of people's activities as an external force beyond 
  their control. This is not only true of a concept like "cultural lag." Many 
  of the terms used by Marx to describe people's activities have been raised to 
  the status of external and even "natural" forces which determine people's activity; 
  thus concepts like "class struggle," "production relations" and particularly 
  "The Dialectic," play the same role in the theories of some "Marxists" that 
  "Original Sin," "Fate" and "The Hand of Destiny" played in the theories of medieval 
  mystifiers.<br>
  <br>
  In the performance of their daily activities, the members of capitalist society 
  simultaneously carry out two processes: they reproduce the form of their activities, 
  and they eliminate the material conditions to which this form of activity initially 
  responded. But they do not know they carry out these processes; their own activities 
  are not transparent to them. They are under the illusion that their activities 
  are responses to natural conditions beyond their control and do not see that 
  they are themselves authors of those conditions. The task of capitalist ideology 
  is to maintain the veil which keeps people from seeing that their own activities 
  reproduce the form of their daily life; the task of critical theory is to unveil 
  the activities of daily life, to render them transparent, to make the reproduction 
  of the social form of capitalist activity visible within people's daily activities.<br>
  <br>
  Under capitalism, daily life consists of related activities which reproduce 
  and expand the capitalist form of social activity. The sale of labor-time for 
  a price (a wage), the embodiment of labortime in commodities (saleable goods, 
  both tangible and intangible), the consumption of tangible and intangible commodities 
  (such as consumer goods and spectacles)-these activities which characterize 
  daily life under capitalism are not manifestations of "human nature," nor are 
  they imposed on men by forces beyond their control.<br>
  <br>
  If it is held that man is "by nature" an uninventive tribesman and an inventive 
  businessman, a submissive slave and a proud craftsman an independent hunter 
  and a dependent wage-worker, then either man's "nature" is an empty concept, 
  or man's "nature'' depends on material and historical conditions, and is in 
  fact a response to those conditions.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Alienation of Living Activity</p>
<p> In capitalist society, creative activity takes the form of commodity production, 
  market production of marketable goods, and the results of human activity take 
  the form of commodities. Marketability or saleability is the universal characteristic 
  of all practical activity and all products. The products of human activity which 
  are necessary for survival have the form of saleable goods: they are only available 
  in exchange for money. And money is only available in exchange for commodities. 
  If a large number of men accept the legitimacy of these conventions, if they 
  accept the convention that commodities are a prerequisite for money, and that 
  money is a prerequisite for survival, then they find themselves locked into 
  a vicious circle. Since they have no commodities, their only exit from this 
  circle is to regard themselves, or parts of themselves, as commodities. And 
  this is, in fact, the peculiar "solution" which men impose on themselves in 
  the face of specific material and historical conditions. They do not exchange 
  their bodies or parts of their bodies for money. They exchange the creative 
  content of their lives, their practical daily activity, for money.<br>
  <br>
  As soon as men accept money as an equivalent for life, the sale of living activity 
  becomes a condition for their physical and social survival. Life is exchanged 
  for survival. Creation and production come to mean sold activity. A man's activity 
  is "productive," useful to society, only when it is sold activity. And the man 
  himself is a productive member of society only if the activities of his daily 
  life are sold activities. As soon as people accept the terms of this exchange, 
  daily activity takes the form of universal prostitution.<br>
  <br>
  The sold creative power, or sold daily activity, takes the form of labor. Labor 
  is a historically specific form of human activity. Labor is abstract activity 
  which has only one property: it is marketable, it can be sold for a given quantity 
  of money. Labor is indifferent activity: indifferent to the particular task 
  performed and indifferent to the particular subject to which the task is directed. 
  Digging, printing and carving are different activities, but all three are labor 
  in capitalist society. Labor is simply "earning money." Living activity which 
  takes the form of labor is a means to earn money. Life becomes a means of survival.<br>
  <br>
  This ironic reversal is not the dramatic climax of an imaginative novel; it 
  is a fact of daily life in capitalist society. Survival, namely self-preservation 
  and reproduction, is not the means to creative practical activity, but precisely 
  the other way around. Creative activity in the form of labor, namely sold activity, 
  is a painful necessity for survival; labor is the means to selfpreservation 
  and reproduction.<br>
  <br>
  The sale of living activity brings about another reversal. Through sale, the 
  labor of an individual becomes the "property" of another, it is appropriated 
  by another, it comes under the control of another. In other words, a person's 
  activity becomes the activity of another, the activity of its owner; it becomes 
  alien to the person who performs it. Thus one's life, the accomplishments of 
  an individual in the world, the difference which his life makes in the life 
  of humanity, are not only transformed into labor, a painful condition for survival; 
  they are transformed into alien activity, activity performed by the buyer of 
  that 1abor. In capitalist society, the architects, the engineers, the laborers, 
  are not builders; the man who buys their labor is the builder; their projects, 
  calculations and motions are alien to them; their living activity, their accomplishments, 
  are his.<br>
  <br>
  Academic sociologists, who take the sale of labor for granted, understand this 
  alienation of labor as a feeling: the worker's activity "appears" alien to the 
  worker, it "seems" to be controlled by another. However, any worker can explain 
  to the academic sociologists that the alienation is neither a feeling nor an 
  idea in the worker's head, but a real fact about the worker's daily life. The 
  sold activity is in fact alien to the worker; his labor is in fact controlled 
  by its buyer.<br>
  <br>
  In exchange for his sold activity, the worker gets money, the conventionally 
  accepted means of survival in capitalist society. With this money he can buy 
  commodities, things, but he cannot buy back his activity. This reveals a peculiar 
  "gap" in money as the "universal equivalent." A person can sell commodities 
  for money, and he can buy the same commodities with money. He can sell his living 
  activity for money, but he cannot buy his living activity for money.<br>
  <br>
  The things the worker buys with his wages are first of all consumer goods which 
  enable him to survive, to reproduce his laborpower so as to be able to continue 
  selling it; and they are spectacles, objects for passive admiration. He consumes 
  and admires the products of human activity passively. He does not exist in the 
  world as an active agent who transforms it. but as a helpless impotent spectator 
  he may call this state of powerless admiration "happiness," and since labor 
  is painful, he may desire to be "happy," namely inactive, all his life (a condition 
  similar to being born dead). The commodities, the spectacles, consume him; he 
  uses up living energy in passive admiration; he is consumed by things. In this 
  sense, the more he has, the less he is. (An individual can surmount this death-in-life 
  through marginal creative activity; but the population cannot, except by abolishing 
  the capitalist form of practical activity, by abolishing wagelabor and thus 
  de-alienating creative activity.)
<p class="subtitle">
  The Fetishism of Commodities</p>
<p>By alienating their activity and embodying it in commodities, in material receptacles 
  of human labor, people reproduce themselves and create Capital. From the standpoint 
  of capitalist ideology, and particularly of academic Economics, this statement 
  is untrue: commodities are "not the product of labor alone"; they are produced 
  by the primordial "factors of production," Land, Labor and Capital, the capitalist 
  Holy Trinity, and the main "factor" is obviously the hero of the piece, Capital. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The purpose of this superficial Trinity is not analysis, since analysis is not 
  what these Experts are paid for. They are paid to obfuscate, to mask the social 
  form of practical activity under capitalism, to veil the fact that producers 
  reproduce themselves, their exploiters, as well as the instruments with which 
  they're exploited. The Trinity formula does not succeed in convincing. It is 
  obvious that land is no more of a commodity producer than water, air, or the 
  sun. Furthermore Capital, which is at once a name for a social relation between 
  workers and capitalists, for the instruments of production owned by a capitalist, 
  and for the money-equivalent of his instruments and "intangibles," does not 
  produce anything more than the ejaculations shaped into publishable form by 
  the academic Economists. Even the instruments of production which are the capital 
  of one capitalist are primordial "factors of production" only if one's blinders 
  limit his view to an isolated capitalist firm, since a view of the entire economy 
  reveals that the capital of one capitalist is the material receptacle of the 
  labor alienated to another capitalist. However, though the Trinity formula does 
  not convince, it does accomplish the task of obfuscation by shifting the subject 
  of the question: instead of asking why the activity of people under capitalism 
  takes the form of wage-labor, potential analysts of capitalist daily life are 
  transformed into academic house-Marxists who ask whether or not labor is the 
  only "factor of production." <br>
  <br>
  Thus Economics (and capitalist ideology in general) treats land, money, and 
  the products of labor, as things which have the power to produce, to create 
  value, to work for their owners, to transform the world. This is what Marx called 
  the fetishism which characterizes people's everyday conceptions, and which is 
  raised to the level of dogma by Economics. For the economist, living people 
  are things ("factors of production"), and things live (money "works," Capital 
  "produces"). The fetish worshipper attributes the product of his own activity 
  to his fetish. As a result, he ceases to exert his own Fewer (the power to transform 
  nature, the power to determine the form and content of his daily life); he exerts 
  only those "powers" which he attributes to his fetish (the "power" to buy commodities). 
  In other words, the fetish worshipper emasculates himself and attributes virility 
  to his fetish. <br>
  <br>
  But the fetish is a dead thing, not a living being; it has no virility. The 
  fetish is no more than a thing for which, and through which, capitalist relations 
  are maintained. The mysterious power of Capital, its "power" to produce, its 
  virility, does not reside in itself, but in the fact that people alienate their 
  creative activity, that they sell their labor to capitalists, that they materialize 
  or reify their alienated labor in commodities. In other words, people are bought 
  with the products of their own activity, yet they sec their own activity as 
  the activity of Capital, and their own products as the products of Capital. 
  By attributing creative power to Capital and not to their own activity, they 
  renounce their living activity, their everyday life, to Capital, which means 
  that people give themselves daily, to the personification of Capital, the capitalist. 
  <br>
  <br>
  By selling their labor, by alienating their activity, people daily reproduce 
  the personifications of the dominant forms of activity under capitalism, they 
  reproduce the wage-laborer and the capitalist. They do not merely reproduce 
  the individuals physically, but socially as well; they reproduce individuals 
  who are sellers of labor-power, and individuals who are owners of means of production; 
  they reproduce the individuals as well as the specific activities, the sale 
  as well as the ownership. <br>
  <br>
  Every time people perform an activity they have not themselves defined and do 
  not control, every time they pay for goods they produced with money they received 
  in exchange for their alienated activity, every time they passively admire the 
  products of their own activity as alien objects procured by their money, they 
  give new life to Capital and annihilate their own lives. <br>
  <br>
  The aim of the process is the reproduction of the relation between the worker 
  and the capitalist. However, this is not the aim of the individual agents engaged 
  in it. Their activities are not transparent to them; their eyes are fixed on 
  the fetish that stands between the act and its result. The individual agents 
  keep their eyes fixed on things, precisely those things for which capitalist 
  relations are established. The worker as producer aims to exchange his daily 
  labor for money-wages, he aims precisely for the thing through which his relation 
  to the capitalist is re established, the thing through which he reproduces himself 
  as a wage- worker and the other as a capitalist. The worker as consumer exchanges 
  his money for products of labor, precisely the things which the capitalist has 
  to sell in order to realize his Capital. <br>
  <br>
  The daily transformation of living activity into Capital is mediated by things, 
  it is not carried out by the things. The fetish worshipper does not know this; 
  for him labor and land, instruments and money, entrepreneurs rind bankers, are 
  all "factors" and "agents." When a hunter wearing an amulet downs a deer with 
  a stone, he may consider the amulet an essential "factor" in downing the deer 
  and even in providing the deer as an object to be downed. If he is a responsible 
  and well-educated fetish worshipper, he will devote his attention to his amulet, 
  nourishing it with care and admiration; in order to improve the material conditions 
  of his life, he will improve the way he wears his fetish, not the way he throws 
  the stone; in a bind, he may even send his amulet to "hunt" for him. His own 
  daily activities are not transparent to him: when he eats well, he fails to 
  see that it is his own action of throwing the stone, and not the action of the 
  amulet, that provided his food; when he starves, he fails to See that it is 
  his own action of worshipping the amulet instead of hunting, and not the wrath 
  of his fetish, that causes his starvation. <br>
  <br>
  The fetishism of commodities and money, the mystification of one's daily activities, 
  the religion of everyday life which attributes living activity to inanimate 
  things, is not a mental caprice born in men's imaginations; it has its origin 
  in the character of social relations under capitalism. Men do in fact relate 
  to each other through things; the fetish is in fact the occasion for which they 
  act collectively, and through which they reproduce their activity. But it is 
  not the fetish that performs the activity. It is not Capital that transforms 
  raw materials, nor Capital that produces goods. If living activity did not transform 
  the materials, these would remain untransformed, inert, dead matter. If men 
  were not disposed to continue selling their living activity, the impotence of 
  Capital would be revealed; Capital would cease to exist; its last remaining 
  potency would be the power to remind people of a bypassed form of everyday life 
  characterized by daily universal prostitution. <br>
  <br>
  The worker alienates his life in order to preserve his life. If he did not sell 
  his living activity he could not get a wage and could not survive. However, 
  it is not the wage that makes alienation the condition for survival. If men 
  were collectively not disposed to sell their lives, if they were disposed to 
  take control over their own activities, universal prostitution would not be 
  a condition for survival. It is people's disposition to continue selling their 
  labor, and not the things for which they sell it, that makes the alienation 
  of living activity necessary for the preservation of life. <br>
  <br>
  The living activity sold by the worker is bought by the capitalist. And it is 
  only this living activity that breathes life into Capital and makes it "productive." 
  The capitalist, an "owner" of raw materials and instruments of production, presents 
  natural objects and products of other people's labor as his own "private property. 
  But it is not the mysterious power of Capital that creates the capitalist's 
  "private property" ;living activity is what creates the "property," and the 
  form of that activity is what keeps it "private." </p>
<p class="subtitle">Transformation of Living Activity into Capital</p>
<p> The transformation of living activity into Capital takes place through things, 
  daily, but is not carried out by things. Things which are products of human 
  activity seem to be active agents because activities and contacts are established 
  for and through things, and because people's activities are not transparent 
  to them; they confuse the mediating object with the cause.<br>
  <br>
  In the capitalist process of production, the worker embodies or materializes 
  his alienated living energy in an inert object by using instruments which are 
  embodiments of other people's activity. (Sophisticated industrial instruments 
  embody the intellectual and manual activity of countless generations of inventors, 
  improvers and producers from all corners of the globe and from varied forms 
  of society.) The instruments in themselves are inert objects; they are material 
  embodiments of living activity, but are not themselves alive. The only active 
  agent in the production process is the living laborer. He uses the products 
  of other people's labor and infuses them with life, so to speak, but the life 
  is his own; he is not able to resurrect the individuals who stored their living 
  activity in his instrument. The instrument may enable him to do more during 
  a given time period, and in this sense it may raise his productivity. But only 
  the living labor which is able to produce can be productive.<br>
  <br>
  For example, when an industrial worker runs an electric lathe, he uses products 
  of the labor of generations of physicists, inventors, electrical engineers, 
  lathe makers. He is obviously more productive than a craftsman who carves the 
  same object by hand. But it is in no sense the "Capital" at the disposal of 
  the industrial worker which is more "productive" than the "Capital'' of the 
  craftsman. If generations of intellectual and manual activity had not been embodied 
  in the electric lathe, if the industrial worker had to invent the lathe, electricity, 
  and the electric lathe, then it would take him numerous lifetimes to turn a 
  single object on an electric lathe, and no amount of Capital could raise his 
  productivity above that of the craftsman who carves the object by hand. <br>
  <br>
  The notion of the "productivity of capital," and particularly the detailed measurement 
  of that "productivity," are inventions of the "science" of Economics, that religion 
  of capitalist daily life which uses up people's energy in the worship, admiration 
  and flattery of the central fetish of capitalist society. Medieval colleagues 
  of these "scientists" performed detailed measurements of the height and width 
  of angels in Heaven, without ever asking what angels or Heaven were, and taking 
  for granted the existence of both. <br>
  <br>
  The result of the worker's sold activity is a product which does not belong 
  to him. This product is an embodiment of his labor, a materialization of a part 
  of his life, a receptacle which contains his living activity, but it is not 
  his; it is: as alien to him as his labor. He did not decide to make it, and 
  when it is made he does not dispose of it. If he wants it, he has to buy it. 
  What he has made is not simply a product with certain useful properties; for 
  that he did not need to sell his labor to a capitalist in exchange for a wage; 
  he need only have picked the necessary materials and the available tools, he 
  need only have shaped the materials guided by his goals and limited by his knowledge 
  and ability. (It is obvious that an individual can only do this marginally; 
  men's appropriation and use of the materials and tools available to them can 
  only take place after the overthrow of the capitalist form of activity.) <br>
  <br>
  What the worker produces under capitalist conditions is a product with a very 
  specific property, the property of saleability. What his alienated activity 
  produces is a commodity. <br>
  <br>
  Because capitalist production is commodity production, the statement that the 
  goal of the process is the satisfaction of human needs is false; it is a rationalization 
  and an apology. The "satisfaction of human needs" is not the goal of the capitalist 
  or of the worker engaged in production, nor is it a result of the process. The 
  worker sells his labor in order to get a wage; the specific content of the labor 
  is indifferent to him; he does not alienate his labor to a capitalist who does 
  not give him a wage in exchange for it, no matter how many human needs this 
  capitalist's products may satisfy. The capitalist buys labor and engages it 
  in production in order to emerge with commodities which can be sold. He is indifferent 
  to the specific properties of the product, just as he is indifferent to people's 
  needs; all that interests him about the product is how much it will sell for, 
  and all that interests him about people's needs is how much they "need" to buy 
  and how they can be coerced, through propaganda and psychological conditioning, 
  to "need" more. The capitalist's goal Is to satisfy his need to reproduce and 
  enlarge Capital, and the result of the process is the expanded reproduction 
  of wage labor and Capital (which are not "human needs"). <br>
  <br>
  The commodity produced by the worker is exchanged by the capitalist for a specific 
  quantity of money; the commodity is a value which is exchanged for an equivalent 
  value. In other words, the living and past labor materialized in the product 
  can exist in two distinct yet equivalent forms, in commodities and in money, 
  or in what is common to both, value. This does not mean that value is labor. 
  Value is the social form of reified (materialized) labor in capitalist society. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Under capitalism, social relations are not established directly; they are established 
  through value. Everyday activity is not exchanged directly; it is exchanged 
  In the form of value. Consequently, what happens to living activity under capitalism 
  cannot be traced by observing the activity itself, but only by following the 
  metamorphoses of value. <br>
  <br>
  When the living activity of people takes the form of labor (alienated activity), 
  it acquires the property of exchangeability; it acquires the form of value. 
  In other words, the labor can be exchanged for an "equivalent" quantity of money 
  (wages). The deliberate alienation of living activity, which is perceived as 
  necessary for survival by the members of capitalist society, itself reproduces 
  the capitalist form within which alienation is necessary for survival. Because 
  of the fact that living activity has the form of value, the products of that 
  activity must also have the form of value: they must be exchangeable for money. 
  This is obvious since, if the products of labor did not take the form of value, 
  but for example the form of useful objects at the disposal of society, then 
  they would either remain in the factory or they would be taken freely by the 
  members of society whenever a need for them arose; in either case, the money-wages 
  received by the workers would have no value, and living activity could not be 
  sold for an "equivalent" quantity of money; living activity could not be alienated. 
  Consequently, as soon as living activity takes the form of value, the products 
  of that activity take the form of value, and the reproduction of everyday life 
  takes place through changes or metamorphoses of value. <br>
  <br>
  The capitalist sells the products of labor on a market; he exchanges them for 
  an equivalent sum of money; he realizes a determined value. The specific magnitude 
  of this value on a particular market is the price of the commodities. For the 
  academic Economist, Price is St. Peter's key to the gates of Heaven. Like Capital 
  itself, Price moves within a wonderful world which consists entirely of objects; 
  the objects have human relations with each other, and are alive; they transform 
  each other, communicate with each other; they marry and have children. .nd of 
  course it is only through the grace of these intelligent, powerful and creative 
  objects that people can be so happy in capitalist society. <br>
  <br>
  In the Economist's pictorial representations of the workings of heaven, the 
  angels do everything and men do nothing at all; men simply enjoy what these 
  superior beings do for them. Not only does Capital produce and money work; other 
  mysterious beings have similar virtues. Thus Supply, a quantity of things which 
  are sold, and Demand, a quantity of things which are bought, together determine 
  Price, a quantity of money; when Supply and Demand marry on a particular point 
  of the diagram, they give birth to Equilibrium Price, which corresponds to a 
  universal state of bliss. The activities of everyday life are played out by 
  things, and people are reduced to things ("factors of production") during their 
  productive" hours, and to passive spectators of things during their "leisure 
  time." The virtue of the Economic Scientist consists of his ability to attribute 
  the outcome of people's everyday activities to things, and of his inability 
  to see the living activity of people underneath the antics of the things. For 
  the Economist, the things through which the activity of people is regulated 
  under capitalism are themselves the mothers and sons, the causes and consequences 
  of their own activity. <br>
  <br>
  The magnitude of value, namely the price of a commodity, the quantity of money 
  for which it exchanges, is not determined by things, but by the daily activities 
  of people. Supply and demand, perfect and imperfect competition, are nothing 
  more than social forms of products and activities in capitalist society; they 
  have no life of their own. The fact that activity is alienated, namely that 
  labor-time is sold for a specific sum of money, that it has a certain value, 
  has several consequences for the magnitude of the value of the products of that 
  labor. The value of the sold commodities must at least be equal to the value 
  of the labor-time. This is obvious both from the standpoint of the individual 
  capitalist firm, and from the standpoint of society as a whole. If the value 
  of the commodities sold by the individual capitalist were smaller than the value 
  of the labor he hired, then his labor expenditures alone would be larger than 
  his earnings, and he would quickly go bankrupt. Socially, if the value of the 
  laborers production were smaller than the value of their consumption, then the 
  labor force could not even reproduce itself, not to speak of a class of capitalists. 
  However, if the value of the commodities were merely equal to the value of the 
  labor- time expended on them, the commodity producers would merely reproduce 
  themselves, and their society would not be a capitalist society; their activity 
  might still consist of commodity production, but it would not be capitalist 
  commodity production. <br>
  <br>
  For labor to create Capital, the value of the products of labor must be larger 
  than the value of the labor. In other words, the labor force must produce a 
  surplus product, a quantity of goods which it does not consume, and this surplus 
  product must be transformed into surplus value, a form of value which is not 
  appropriated by workers as wages, but by capitalists as profit. Furthermore, 
  the value of the products of labor must be larger still, since living labor 
  is not the only kind of labor materialized in them. In the production process, 
  workers expend their own energy, but they also use up the stored labor of others 
  as instruments, and they shape materials on which labor was previously expended. 
  <br>
  <br>
  This leads to the strange result that the value of the laborer's products and 
  the value of his wage are different magnitudes, namely that the sum of money 
  received by the capitalist when he sells the commodities produced by his hired 
  laborers is different from the sum he pays the laborers. This difference is 
  not explained by the fact that the used- up materials and tools must be paid 
  for. If the value of the sold commodities were equal to the value of the living 
  labor and the instruments, there would still be no room for capitalists. The 
  fact is that the difference between the two magnitudes must be large enough 
  to support a class of capitalists-not only the individuals, but also the specific 
  activity that these individuals engage in, namely the purchase of labor. The 
  difference between the total value of the products and the value of the labor 
  spent on their production is surplus value, the seed of Capital. <br>
  <br>
  In order to locate the origin of surplus value, it is necessary to examine why 
  the value of the labor is smaller than the value of the commodities produced 
  by it. The alienated activity of the worker transforms materials with the aid 
  of instruments, and produces a certain quantity of commodities. However, when 
  these commodities are sold and the used-up materials and instruments are paid 
  for, the workers are not given the remaining value of their products as their 
  wages; they are given less. In other words, during every working day, the workers 
  perform a certain quantity of unpaid labor, forced label, for which they receive 
  no equivalent. <br>
  <br>
  The performance of this unpaid labor, this forced labor, is another "condition 
  for survival" in capitalist society. However, like alienation, this condition 
  is not imposed by nature, but by the collective practice of people, by their 
  everyday activities. Before the existence of unions, an individual worker accepted 
  whatever forced labor was available, since rejection of the labor would have 
  meant that other workers would accept the available terms of exchange, and the 
  individual worker would receive no wage. Workers competed with each other for 
  the wages offered by capitalists; if a worker quit because the wage was unacceptably 
  low, an unemployed worker was willing to replace him, since for the unemployed 
  a small wage is higher than no wage at all. This competition among workers was 
  called "free labor" by capitalists, who made great sacrifices to maintain the 
  freedom of workers, since it was precisely this freedom that preserved the surplus 
  value of the capitalist and made it possible for him to accumulate Capital. 
  It was not any worker's aim to produce more goods than he was paid for. His 
  aim was to get a wage which was as large as possible. However, the existence 
  of workers who got no wage at all, and whose conception of a large wage was 
  consequently more modest than that of an employed worker, made it possible for 
  the capitalist to hire labor at a lower wage. In fact, the existence of unemployed 
  workers made it possible for the capitalist to pay the lowest wage that workers 
  were willing to work for. Thus the result of the collective daily activity of 
  the workers, each striving individually for the largest possible wage, was to 
  lower the wages of all; the effect of the competition of each against all was 
  that all got the smallest possible wage, and the capitalist got the largest 
  possible surplus. <br>
  <br>
  The daily practice of all annuls the goals of each. But the workers did not 
  know that their situation was a product of their own daily behavior; their own 
  activities were not transparent to them. To the workers it seemed that low wages 
  were simply a natural part of life, like illness and death, and that falling 
  wages were a natural catastrophe, like a flood or a hard winter. The critiques 
  of socialists and the analyses of Marx, as well as an increase in industrial 
  development which afforded more time for reflection, stripped away some of the 
  veils and made it possible for workers to see through their activities to some 
  extent. However. in Western Europe and the United States, workers did not get 
  rid of the capitalist form of daily life; they formed unions. And in the different 
  material conditions of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, workers (and peasants) 
  replaced the capitalist class with a state bureaucracy that purchases alienated 
  labor and accumulates Capital in the name of Marx. <br>
  <br>
  With unions, daily life is similar to what it was before unions. in fact, it 
  is almost the same. Daily life continues to consist of labor, of alienated activity, 
  and of unpaid labor, or forced labor. The unionized worker no longer settles 
  the terms of his alienation; union functionaries do this for him. The terms 
  on which the worker's activity is alienated are no longer guided by the individual 
  worker's need to accept what is available; they are now guided by the union 
  bureaucrat's need to maintain his position as pimp between the sellers of labor 
  and the buyers. <br>
  <br>
  With or without unions, surplus value is neither a product of nature nor of 
  Capital; it is created by the daily activities of people. In the performance 
  of their daily activities, people are not only disposed to alienate these activities, 
  they are also disposed to reproduce the conditions which force them to alienate 
  their activities, to reproduce Capital and thus the power of Capital to purchase 
  labor. This is not because they do not know "what the alternative is." A person 
  who is incapacitated by chronic indigestion because he eats ton much grease 
  does not continue eating grease because he does not know what the alternative 
  is. Either he prefers being incapacitated to giving up grease, or else it is 
  not clear to him that his daily consumption of grease causes his incapacity. 
  And if his doctor, preacher, teacher and politician tell him, first, that the 
  grease is what keeps him alive, and secondly that they already do for him everything 
  he would do if he were well, then it is not surprising that his activity is 
  not transparent to him and that he makes no great effort to render it transparent. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The production of surplus value is a condition of survival, not for the population, 
  but for the capitalist system Surplus value is the portion of the value of commodities 
  produced by labor which is not returned to the laborers. It can be expressed 
  either in commodities or in money (just as Capital can be expressed either as 
  a quantity things or of money), but this does not alter the fact that it is 
  an expression for the materialized labor which is stored in a given quantity 
  of products. Since the products can be exchanged for an "equivalent" quantity 
  of money, the money "stands for", or represents, the same value as the products. 
  The money can, in turn, be exchanged for another quantity of products of "equivalent" 
  value. The ensemble of these exchanges, which take place simultaneously during 
  the performance of capitalist daily life, constitutes the capitalist process 
  of circulation. It is through this process that the metamorphosis of surplus 
  value into Capital takes place. <br>
  <br>
  The portion of value which does not return to labor, namely surplus value, allows 
  the capitalist to exist, and it also allows him to do much more than simply 
  exist. The capitalist invests a portion of this surplus value; he hires new 
  workers and buys new means of production; he expands his dominion. What this 
  means is that the capitalist accumulates new labor, both in the form of the 
  living labor he hires and of the past labor (paid and unpaid) which is stored 
  in the materials and machines he buys. <br>
  <br>
  The capitalist class as a whole accumulates the surplus labor of society, but 
  this process takes place on a social scale and consequently cannot be seen if 
  one observes only the activities of an individual capitalist. It must be remembered 
  that the products bought by a given capitalist as instruments have the same 
  characteristics as the products he sells. A first capitalist sells instruments 
  to a second capitalist for a given sum of value, and only a part of this value 
  is returned to workers as wages; the remaining part is surplus value, with which 
  the first capitalist buys new instruments and labor. The second capitalist buys 
  the instruments for the given value, which means that he pays for the total 
  quantity of labor rendered to the first capitalist, the quantity of labor which 
  was remunerated as well as the quantity performed free of charge. This means 
  that the instruments accumulated by the second capitalist contain the unpaid 
  labor performed for the first. The second capitalist, in turn, sells his products 
  for a given value, and returns only a portion of this value to his laborers; 
  he uses the remainder for new instruments and labor. <br>
  <br>
  If the whole process were squeezed into a single time period, and if all the 
  capitalists were aggregated into one, it would he seen that the value with which 
  the capitalist acquires new instruments and labor is equal to the value of the 
  products which he did not return to the producers. This accumulated surplus 
  labor is Capital. <br>
  <br>
  In terms of capitalist society as a whole, the total Capital is equal to the 
  sum of unpaid labor performed by generations of human beings whose lives consisted 
  of the daily alienation of their living activity. In other words Capital, in 
  the face of which men sell their living days, is the product of the sold activity 
  of men, and is reproduced and expanded every day a man sells another working 
  day, every moment he decides to continue living the capitalist form of daily 
  life. </p>
<p class="subtitle">Storage and Accumulation of Human Activity</p>
<p>The transformation of surplus labor into Capital is a specific historical form 
  of a more general process, the process of industrialization, the permanent transformation 
  of man's material environment. <br>
  <br>
  Certain essential characteristics of this consequence of human activity under 
  capitalism can he grasped by means of a simplified illustration. In an imaginary 
  society, people spend most of their active time producing food and other necessities; 
  only part of their time is "surplus time" in the sense that it is exempted from 
  the production of necessities. This surplus activity may be devoted to the production 
  of food for priests and warriors who do not themselves produce; it may be used 
  to produce goods which are burned for sacred occasions; it may be used up in 
  the performance of ceremonies or gymnastic exercises. In any of these cases, 
  the material conditions of these people are not likely to change, from one generation 
  to another, as a result of their daily activities. However, one generation of 
  people of this imaginary society may store their surplus time instead of using 
  it up. For example, they may spend this surplus time winding up springs. The 
  next generation may unwind the energy stored in the springs to perform necessary 
  tasks, or may simply use the energy of the springs to wind new springs. In either 
  case, the stored surplus labor of the earlier generation will provide the new 
  generation with a larger quantity of surplus working time. The new generation 
  may also store this surplus in springs and in other receptacles. In a relatively 
  short period, the labor stored in the springs will exceed the labor time available 
  to any living generation; with the expenditure of relatively little energy, 
  the people of this imaginary society will be able to harness the springs to 
  most of their necessary tasks, and also to the task of winding new springs for 
  coming generations. Most of the living hours which they previously spent producing 
  necessities will now be available for activities which are not dictated by necessity 
  but projected by the imagination. <br>
  <br>
  At first glance it seems unlikely that people would devote living hours to the 
  bizarre task of winding springs. It seems just as unlikely, even if they wound 
  the springs, that they would store them for future generations, since the unwinding 
  of the springs might provide, for example, a marvellous spectacle on festive 
  days. <br>
  <br>
  However, if people did not dispose of their own lives, if their working activity 
  were not their own, if their practical activity consisted of forced labor, then 
  human activity might well be harnessed to the task of winding springs, the task 
  of storing surplus working time in material receptacles. The historical role 
  of Capitalism, a role which was performed by people who accepted the legitimacy 
  of others to dispose of their lives, consisted precisely of storing human activity 
  in material receptacles by means of forced labor. <br>
  <br>
  As soon as people submit to the "power" of money to buy stored labor as well 
  as living activity, as soon as they accept the fictional "right" of money-holders 
  to control and dispose of the stored as well as the living activity of society, 
  they transform money into Capital and the owners of money into Capitalists. 
  <br>
  <br>
  This double alienation, the alienation of living activity in the form of wage 
  labor, and the alienation of the activity of past generations in the form of 
  stored labor (means of production), is not a single act which took place sometime 
  in history. The relation between workers and capitalists is not a thing which 
  imposed itself on society at some point in the past, once and for all. At no 
  time did men sign a contract, or even make a verbal agreement, in which they 
  gave up the power over their living activity, and in which they gave up the 
  power over the living activity of all future generations on all parts of the 
  globe. <br>
  <br>
  Capital wears the mask of a natural force; it seems as solid as the earth itself; 
  its movements appear as irreversible as tides; its crises seem as unavoidable 
  as earthquakes and floods. Even when it is admitted that the power of Capital 
  is created by men, this admission may merely be the occasion for the invention 
  of an even more imposing mask, the mask of a man-made force, a Frankenstein 
  monster, whose power inspires more awe than that of any natural force. <br>
  <br>
  However, Capital is neither a natural force nor a man- made monster which was 
  created sometime in the past and which dominated human life ever since. The 
  power of Capital does not reside in money, since money is a social convention 
  which has no more "power" than men are willing to grant it; when men refuse 
  to sell their labor, money cannot perform even the simplest tasks, because money 
  does not "work." <br>
  <br>
  Nor does the power of Capital reside in the material receptacles in which the 
  labor of past generations is stored, since the potential energy stored in these 
  receptacles can be liberated by the activity of living people whether or not 
  the receptacles are Capital, namely alien property." Without living activity, 
  the collection of objects which constitute society's Capital would merely be 
  a scattered heap of assorted artefacts with no life of their own, and the "owners'' 
  of Capital would merely be a scattered assortment of uncommonly uncreative people 
  (by training) who surround themselves with bits of paper in a vain attempt to 
  resuscitate memories of past grandeur. The only "power" of Capital resides in 
  the daily activities of living people; this "power" consists of the disposition 
  of people to sell their daily activities in exchange for money, and to give 
  up control over the products of their own activity and of the activity of earlier 
  generations. <br>
  <br>
  As soon as a person sells his labor to a capitalist and accepts only a part 
  of his product as payment for that labor, he creates conditions for the purchase 
  and exploitation of other people. No man would willingly give his arm or his 
  child in exchange for money; yet when a man deliberately and consciously sells 
  his working life in order to acquire the necessities for life, he not only reproduces 
  the conditions which continue to make the sale of his life a necessity for its 
  preservation; he also creates conditions which make the sale of life a necessity 
  for other people. Later generations may of course refuse to sell their working 
  lives for the same reason that he refused to sell his arm; however each failure 
  to refuse alienated and forced labor enlarges the stock of stored labor with 
  which Capital can buy working lives. <br>
  <br>
  In order to transform surplus labor into Capital, the capitalist has to find 
  a way to store it in material receptacles, in new means of production. and he 
  must hire new laborers to activate the new means of production. In other words, 
  he must enlarge his enterprise, or start a new enterprise in a different branch 
  of production. This presupposes or requires the existence of materials that 
  can be shaped into new saleable commodities, the existence of buyers of the 
  new products, and the existence of people who are poor enough to be willing 
  to sell their labor. These requirements are themselves created by capitalist 
  activity, and capitalists recognize no limits or obstacles to their activity; 
  the democracy of Capital demands absolute freedom. <br>
  <br>
  Imperialism is not merely the "last stage" of Capitalism; it is also the first. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Anything which can be transformed into a marketable good is grist for Capital's 
  mill, whether it lies on the capitalist's land or on the neighbor's, whether 
  it lies above ground or under, Boats on the sea or crawls on its floor; whether 
  it is confined to other continents or other planets. All of humanity's explorations 
  of nature, from Alchemy to Physics, are mobilized to search for new materials 
  in which to store labor, to find new objects that someone can be taught to buy. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Buyers for old and new products are created by any and all available means, 
  and new means are constantly discovered. "Open markets" and "open doors" are 
  established by force and fraud. If people lack the means to buy the capitalists' 
  products, they are hired by capitalists and are paid for producing the goods 
  they wish to buy; if local craftsmen already produce what the capitalists have 
  to sell, the craftsmen are ruined or bought-out; if laws or traditions ban the 
  use of certain products, the laws and the traditions are destroyed; if people 
  lack the objects on which to use the capitalists' products, they are taught 
  to buy these objects; if people run out of physical or biological wants, then 
  capitalists "satisfy" their "spiritual wants" and hire psychologists to create 
  them; if people are so satiated with the products of capitalists that they can 
  no longer use new objects, they are taught to buy objects and spectacles which 
  have no use but can simply be observed and admired. <br>
  <br>
  Poor people are found in pre-agrarian and agrarian societies on every continent; 
  if they are not poor enough to be willing to sell their labor when the capitalists 
  arrive, they are impoverished by the activities of the capitalists themselves. 
  The lands of hunters gradually become the "private property" of "owners" who 
  use state violence to restrict the hunters to "reservations" which do not contain 
  enough food to keep them alive. The tools of peasants gradually become available 
  only from the same merchant who generously lends them the money with which to 
  buy the tools, until the peasants' "debts" are so large that they are forced 
  to sell land which neither they nor any of their ancestors had ever bought. 
  The buyers of craftsmen's products gradually become reduced to the merchants 
  who market the products, until the day comes when a merchant decides to house 
  "his craftsmen" under the same roof, and provides them with the instruments 
  which will enable all of them to concentrate their activity on the production 
  of the most profitable items. Independent as well as dependent hunters, peasants 
  and craftsmen, free men as well as slaves, are transformed into hired laborers. 
  Those who previously disposed of their own lives in the face of harsh material 
  conditions cease to dispose of their own lives precisely when they take up the 
  task of modifying their material conditions; those who were previously conscious 
  creators of their own meagre existence become unconscious victims of their own 
  activity even while abolishing the meagreness of their existence. Men who were 
  much but had little now have much but are little. <br>
  <br>
  The production of new commodities, the "opening" of new markets, the creation 
  of new workers, are not three separate activities; they are three aspects of 
  the same activity. A new labor force is created precisely in order to produce 
  the new commodities; the wages received by these laborers are themselves the 
  new market; their unpaid labor is the source of new expansion. Neither natural 
  nor cultural barriers halt the spread of Capital, the transformation of people's 
  daily activity into alienated labor, the transformation of their surplus labor 
  into the "private property" of capitalists. However, Capital is not a natural 
  force; it is a set of activities performed by people every day; it is a form 
  of daily life; its continued existence and expansion presuppose only one essential 
  condition: the disposition of people to continue to alienate their working lives 
  and thus reproduce the capitalist form of daily life. <br>
