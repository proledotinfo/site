<p class="title">THE MALAISE ON THE LEFT</p>
<p class="author"> by Maurice Brinton<br>from SOLIDARITY VII, 12 (November 1974) </p>
<p>
Forget for a moment the scare campaigns of the recent elections: Scanlon and Jones 
presented by the yellow press as proselytizers of red revolution, Mr. Wilson in 
the garb of a latter-day Kerensky opening the gates to Bolshevism or worse, bank 
clerks freezing (a la Portuguese) the funds of fleeting fascists, the great fear 
of the bourgeoisie about a &#8220;mafia of fanatical socialists&#8221; in control 
of the commanding heights... of the National Executive of the Labor Party!</p><p>
The reality is less lurid - and less encouraging. What we see around us is a confident 
and aggressive movement, increasingly aware of the fact that real power does not 
lie in Parliament, but profoundly divided as to objectives, strategy and tactics 
and completely at sea as to values and priorities. So divergent are its component 
strands that one has to ask, quite bluntly, whether one can legitimately speak 
of a movement. Among thinking socialists there is a deep malaise.</p><p>
The purpose of this article is to explore the roots of this malaise, and to show 
that they lie in the transformations of class society itself. Over the last few 
decades - and in many different areas - established society has itself brought 
about the number of the things that the revolutionaries of yesterday were demanding. 
This has happened in relation to economic attitudes, in relation to certain forms 
of social organization, and in relation to various aspects of the personal and 
sexual revolutions. When this adaptation in fact benefits established society, 
it is legitimate to refer to it as &#8220;recuperation&#8221;. This article seeks 
to start a discussion on the limits of recuperation.</p><p>
Recuperation, of course, is nothing new. What is perhaps new is the extent to 
which most &#8220;revolutionaries&#8221; (whether they are demanding &#8220;more 
nationalization&#8221;, more &#8220;self-management&#8221; or &#8220;more personal 
freedom&#8217; are unaware of the system&#8217;s ability to absorb - and in the 
long run benefit from - these forms of &#8220;dissent&#8221;. Class society has 
a tremendous resilience, a great capacity to cope with &#8220;subversion&#8221; 
to make icons of its iconoclasts, to draw sustenance from those who would throttle 
it. Revolutionaries must constantly be aware of this strength, otherwise they 
will fail to see what is happening around them. If certain sacred cows (or certain 
previous formulations, now found to be inadequate) have to be sacrificed, we&#8217;d 
rather do the job ourselves.</p><p class="subtitle">
Recuperation of economic demands</p><p>
Keynesian economic policies, once considered radical threats to bourgeois Society, 
are today widely accepted as essential to the functioning of modern capital ism. 
The demands for nationalization of the mines or railways, for national health 
insurance, for unemployment benefit and for state pensions have been totally recuperated. 
Despite occasional nostalgic (and largely irrelevant) glances into the past, no 
Conservative politician, seeking to retain a shred of credibility, would today 
advocate the return of the mines or of the railways to private ownership - or 
the dismantling of the essential structure of the &#8220;welfare&#8221; state. 
All socialists would agree, thus far.</p><p>
But there is then a parting of the ways. We would claim that the centralization 
of all the means of production in the hands of the state - the most &#8220;radical&#8221; 
demand of the Communist Manifesto - has been achieved in many parts of the world 
without any corresponding enhancement in the areas of human freedom. In fact an 
exploit ing society, divided into order-givers and order-takers, functions far 
better on this type of economic base, which eliminates many of the irrationalities 
of laissez-faire capitalism. Whatever the human aspirations of their rank and 
file, the ideologies and programs of Social Democratic, Communist, Trotskyist 
or Maoist groups in the West provide the most articulate demands for this kind 
of social organization. These groups are the midwives of State Capitalism. They 
may differ as to tempo and as to tactics. They may argue about what they consider 
to be (for others) the acceptable or unacceptable costs. But their fundamental 
objective is the same - and is moreover in keeping with the deepest requirements 
of Capital itself. Pace the ghosts of Hayek and of Schumpeter, pace Enoch Powell 
and Keith Joseph, the division of society into rulers and ruled will not be abolished 
by the abolition of the &#8220;free market&#8221; or, for that mailer, by anything 
that Messrs. Wilson or Gollan (or the &#8220;theoreticians&#8221; of any of the 
Marxist sects) may have in mind.</p><p>
Moreover all over the Third World (from S&eacute;kou Tour&eacute;&#8217;s Guinea 
to North Vietnam, from Iraq to Zanzibar) &#8220;Marxist-Leninist&#8221; ideas 
are today influencing the birth and molding the economic life of many developing 
countries. All are ruthlessly exploitative societies, geared to the rapid development 
of the productive forces. Today this is only possible on the basis of intense 
primary accumulation, carried out on the backs of the peasantry. Here again erstwhile 
revolutionary ideas are becoming vehicles for new forms of enslavement.</p><p>
To paraphrase Marx, it is not what men think they are doing that matters. What 
mailers is the objective result of their beliefs and actions. Class society can 
well recuperate the economic demands of the traditional left. It is not of fundamental 
importance, in this respect, whether various ruling classes are fully aware of 
what is happening to them. They clearly differ from one another in the degree 
of insight they have achieved into their own long-term, historical interests. 
The more far-sighted among them now accept the centralization of the means of 
production in the hands of the State as the essential precondition for the growth 
of the productive forces. For most Marxist socialists (and for the bourgeoisie) 
this growth is the fundamental issue. This is what unites them. This is where 
the bourgeois vision and the Marxist vision coalesce. For both of them economic 
growth is what politics (and ultimately what life itself) is all about. There 
are few other dimensions to their thinking. For both of them the future is mainly 
about &#8220;more of the same&#8221;. And the rest? The rest is for &#8220;after 
the revolution&#8221;. At best, it will look after itself. At worst, if one speaks 
to a traditional Marxist about such issues as women&#8217;s liberation, ecology, 
the &#8220;counter-culture&#8221;, etc. one is denounced as a &#8220;diversionist&#8221; 
in tones showing how deeply the work ethic, patriarchal attitudes and value system 
of the existing society have permeated their thinking.</p><p class="subtitle">
Recuperation of institutional forms</p><p>
Sections of the left have fortunately gone far beyond the demands for nationalization, 
planning, etc. In the wake of the Russian Revolution small groups of &#8220;left&#8221; 
communists clearly foresaw the course of events which this type of &#8220;socialism&#8221; 
would lead to. Slandered by Lenin, denounced by the &#8220;orthodox&#8221; communists, 
they warned of what lay ahead: the rule of the party would soon result in the 
emergence of a new ruling class, based not on the private ownership of the means 
of production but on a monopoly of decisional authority in all areas of economic, 
political and social life. To the hegemony of the Party and to the omniscience 
of its Central Committee the left communist counter-poised the knowledge and power 
of an enlightened and autonomous working class. They posited the institutional 
form this power would take: the Workers&#8217; Councils. This was no genial blueprint 
for a new society sucked out of the thumb of a Gorter or a Pannekoek. From the 
Paris Commune to the Russian Revolution of 1917 the &#8220;council&#8221; form 
of organization had been the living historical product of the class struggle itself. 
The warnings of these earlier revolutionaries have been fully justified.</p><p>
But their vision remains limited. Despite Pannekoek&#8217;s interests in science 
and philosophy, Ruhle&#8217;s interest in pedagogy, and Korsch&#8217;s stress 
on the need for a deep-going cultural critique, most of the writings of the left 
communists centered on problems of work and of production and distribution. They 
lived in a very different era from our own, and had little of significance to 
say about what have become very important areas of social life: bureaucratization, 
alienation in consumption and leisure, authoritarian conditioning, the &#8220;youth 
revolt,&#8221; women&#8217;s liberation, etc. Even some of their institutional 
proposals have been partly overtaken by events.</p><p>
The recuperation of the demand for working class power at the point of production 
and for a society based on Workers&#8217; Councils has, for instance, taken on 
a particularly sinister form. Confronted with the bureaucratic monstrosity of 
Stalinist and post-Stalinist Russia, yet wishing to retain some credibility among 
their working class supporters, various strands of Bolshevism have sought posthumously 
to rehabilitate the concept of &#8220;workers&#8217; control&#8221;. Although 
&#8220;workers&#8217; control&#8221; was only referred to once in the documents 
of the first four congresses of the Communist International it has recently become 
one of the Top Ten Slogans. Between 1917 and1921 all attempts by the working class 
to assert real power over production - or to transcend the narrow role allocated 
to it by the Party - were smashed by the Bolsheviks, after first having been denounced 
as anarchist or anarcho-syndicalist deviations. Today workers&#8217; control is 
presented as a sort of sugar coating to the pill of nationalization of every Trotskyist 
or Leninist micro-bureaucrat on the make. Those who strangled the viable infant 
are now hawking the corpse around. The Institute for Workers&#8217; Control even 
runs annual conferences, addressed and dominated by trade union officials appointed 
for life. Those who are not prepared to allow workers to control their own organizations 
here and now serenade sundry simple-tons with fanciful tunes as to their fate 
in the future. Recuperation here is taking place amid incredible confusion.</p><p>
For a long time the advocacy of genuine workers control (or, as we prefer to call 
it, workers&#8217; self management) remained confined to small groups of revolutionaries 
swimming against the great bureaucratic tide. Following the French events of May 
1968 the demand took on a new reality and a new coherence. People began to see 
self-management as the dominant theme (and Workers&#8217; Councils as the institutional 
form) of a new society in which bureaucracy would be eliminated, and in which 
ordinary people would at last achieve genuine power over many aspects of their 
everyday life. But this again was to ignore the system&#8217;s capacity for integrating 
dissent and harnessing it to its own advantage.</p><p>
Can the demand for self-management be geared to the requirements of class society 
itself? An honest answer would be &#8220;yes, in some respects&#8221;. Yes, providing 
those operating the self-management still accepted the values of the system. Yes, 
if it remained strictly localized. Yes, provided it was eviscerated of all political 
content Car assembly plants seeking to obtain the participation of the workers 
have been operating for some time in the Volvo and Saab factories in Sweden. Under 
the &#8220;with it&#8221; guise of enriching the workers&#8217; job, employers 
have continued to enrich themselves. Groups of workers are allowed to manage their 
own alienation. The powers- that-be seek to resuscitate the anemic institutions 
of existing society (increasingly abandoned by those expected to make them function) 
with transfusions of &#8220;participation&#8221;. No wonder the slogan has been 
taken up by everyone from Gaullist deputies to our own Liberals.</p><p>
Revolutionaries are in some measures to blame for this confusion of form and content. 
They have insufficiently warned against the dangers inherent in any attempts at 
self-management with capitalism. And, in relation to the future, they have insufficiently 
stressed the limitations of the demand. Self-management and Workers&#8217; Councils 
are means to liberation. They are not liberation itself. Many revolutionaries 
have, moreover, tended to underestimate the complex problems of society as a whole. 
These have to be considered in addition to the problems of particular groups of 
workers. Our vision has never been &#8220;the railways to the railway men, the 
dust to the dustmen&#8221;. We are not for self-managed insurance empires, for 
self-managed advertising companies, for the self-managed production of nuclear 
weapons.</p><p>
This is not to say that self-management will not be the dominant theme, and the 
council probably the institutional form of any kind of socialist society. But 
they are no more than that. Into those particular bottles many wines can be poured. 
In contemporary society self-management could very well develop on a reformist, 
racist, nationalistic or militaristic basis. The historical precedents are here. 
Many Workers&#8217; Councils in Germany - in December 1918, and again later on 
- voted to surrender power to parliamentary institutions. Between 1930 and 1945 
the vast majority of the British and German people identified with their respective 
rulers and mobilized themselves (or allowed themselves to be mobilized) in the 
defense of interests that were not their own. Israeli self-managed kibbutzim are 
vehicles for the dissemination of Zionist ideology and for implementing (anti-Arab) 
discrimination, i.e. anti- socialist policies. In Northern Ireland, amid an &#8220;unparalleled 
explosion of self-management&#8221;, the self-activity of a civilian population 
recently brought down a government. . . in the name of sectarian and mystified 
objectives. The lessons are clear. Self- management, divorced from socialist politics, 
is meaningless.</p><p class="subtitle">
Recuperation of &#8220;proto-Marxist&#8221; demands</p><p>
Confronted with the fact that established society has successfully co-opted both 
the economic objectives and some of the institutional prescriptions of those who 
wanted to challenge it, radicals have responded in a numbers of ways.</p><p>
One response has been to delve deeper into Marx. The &#8216;communist project&#8217; 
is redefined in proto-Marxist terms. We now have Marx a Jo carte. What is stressed 
is not what was the historical reality of Marxism (even in Marx&#8217;s day) but 
a vision which, although valid, seldom went beyond the realm of rhetoric. The 
Marx of &#8220;the proletarians have no Fatherland&#8221; replaces the Marx of 
the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71 who supported first Bismarck&#8217;s armies, 
then - after Sedan - the forces of the Second Empire. The Marx who denounced the 
slogan &#8220;a fair day&#8217;s wage for a fair day&#8217;s work&#8221; (arguing 
instead for &#8220;the abolition of the wages system&#8221;) replaces the more 
prosaic Marx, maneuvering among the Lucrafts and the Maltman Barrys in the counsels 
of the First International. The Marx who thundered that &#8220;the emancipation 
of the working class is the task of the working class itself&#8217; erases the 
pathetic figure of the Marx of 1872, cooking the last congress of the International 
(the only one he attended in person), inventing non-existing delegations, shifting 
the venues of future meetings to harass the supporters of the equally authoritarian 
Bakunin.</p><p>
But are even these proto-Marxist prescriptions adequate? Is the &#8220;abolition 
of frontiers&#8221; any kind of guarantee as to the type of regime that will hold 
sway over the new, frontier-less expanse? Is the vision of an exploitative society, 
fusing the techniques of domination of both East and West, just a nightmare dreamed 
up by the writers of science fiction? Is the abolition of the wage labor any guarantee 
against exploitation and alienation? Were there not exploitative societies long 
before wage labor appeared on the historical scene? Wage labor underpins and reinforces 
hierarchies of power. Its abolition does not necessarily abolish such hierarchies. 
Class society might even recuperate demands of this kind.</p><p class="subtitle">
Recuperation of the &#8220;personal revolution&#8221;</p><p>
Another response of those confronted with the tremendous recuperative powers of 
established society has been a tendency to seek individual emancipation, to create 
in the &#8220;here and now&#8221; microcosms of the alternative society. Some 
advocates of this viewpoint see the growth of social freedom as the by-product 
of the addition</p><p>
of one &#8220;free&#8221; individual to another, rather like workers going to 
Ruskin College to become &#8220;emancipated one by one&#8221;. This type of revolt, 
as long as it is conceived in purely individual terms, can readily be recuperated 
by established society. Individual revolt, whether in clothing or in hair styles, 
whether in food preferences or in musical tastes, whether in sexual mores or in 
philosophical attitudes, readily becomes a commodity to be frenetically exploited 
in the interests of Capital itself. (The important book The Failure of the Sexual 
Revolution&#8217; by George Frankl, deals with this theme.)</p><p class="subtitle">
The limits of recuperation</p><p>
In the Irrational in Politics we wrote that exploiting society would not be able 
to tolerate &#8220;the mass development of critical, demystified, self-reliant; 
sexually emancipated, autonomous, non-alienated persons, conscious of what they 
want and prepared to struggle for it&#8221;. We still hold this idea to be basically 
correct. Its core, that, one cannot conceive of any genuinely liberatory movement 
without genuinely liberated individuals seems irrefutable. But our formulation 
was inadequate. We should have spoken of individuals prepared collectively to 
struggle for what they wanted. And we should have spoken more about the objectives 
of the struggle. We should have described more clearly what the vision was, in 
our eyes at least. The socialist transformation of society is not an automatic 
process, or a reflex activity. It requires a sense of direction. There may be 
many roads to the Promised Land but it can surely only help if people know where 
they are going.</p><p>
Let us take it for granted that meaningful activity needs to be collective, that 
social transformation needs emancipated individuals, and that the institutional 
framework of any new society will probably be based, in part at least, on those 
forms which the struggle itself has repeatedly thrown up at its moments of deepest 
insight and creativity. What we now need to think about - and to discuss widely 
throughout the libertarian left - is the political content of an activity that 
consciously seeks both to avoid recuperation and to be relevant to the conditions 
of today.</p><p>
Are certain yardsticks necessary to define such an activity? I personally think 
the answer is &#8220;yes&#8221; - with the proviso that the definition must be 
seen as an ongoing process. Should revolutionaries who share common objectives 
group together, first to discuss their objectives and then to fight for them? 
Again I think the answer is &#8220;yes&#8221;. &#8220;Political Inexistentialism&#8221; 
is only relevant if one thinks there is some divine guidance ensuring that every 
struggle helps move society in a socialist direction.</p><p>
It is only if libertarians speak openly about these questions that they will be 
able to present a credible alternative to the authoritarian left. If socialism 
is the creation of forms of living that will enable all - free from external constraints 
or internalized inhibitions - to rise to their full stature, to fulfill themselves 
as human beings, to enjoy themselves, to relate to one another without treading 
on anybody (and this is as good a definition of socialism as any other) - we should 
say so loud and clear. And we should not be afraid of criticizing any activities 
- however &#8220;self-managed&#8221; - that lead in an opposite direction. Socialism, 
after all, is about a specific way of socializing. In this discussion we must 
not forget the economic prerequisites of what we seek. Nor must we confuse them 
with the objective itself. Finally we must not under estimate the forces we are 
up against, including the recuperative powers of established society. An ongoing 
reassessment of the degree to which one&#8217;s former goals have been recuperated 
is the most effective antidote to the malaise on the left, and the only possible 
prescription for remaining a revolutionary.</p>
