<p class="title">CRITIQUE OF THE SITUATIONIST INTERNATIONAL</p>
<p class="author">by Gilles Dauv&eacute; (1979)</p>
<p class="subtitle">Ideology and the Wage System </p>
<p>Capitalism transforms life into the money necessary for living. One tends to 
  do any particular thing towards an end other than that implied by the content 
  of the activity. The logic of alienation : one is an other; the wage system 
  makes one foreign to what one does, to what one is, to other people. </p>
<p>Now, human activity does not produce only goods and relationships, but also 
  representations. Man is not homo faber : the reduction of human life to the 
  economy (since taken up by official marxism) dates from the enthronement of 
  capital. All activity is symbolic : it creates, at one and the same time, products 
  and a vision of the world. The layout of a primitive village : </p>
<blockquote><p>&quot;summarizes and assures the relations between Man and the universe, between 
  society and the supernatural world, between the living and the dead.&quot; (Levi-Strauss). 
</p></blockquote>
<p>The fetishism of commodities is merely the form taken by this symbolism in 
  societies dominated by exchange. </p>
<p>As capital tends to produce everything as capital, to parcelize everything 
  so as to recompose it with the help of market relations, it also makes of representation 
  a specialized sector of production. Stripped of the means of their material 
  existence, wage-workers are also stripped of the means of producing their ideas, 
  which are produced by a specialized sector (whence the role of the &quot;intellectuals&quot;, 
  a term introduced in France by the Manifesto of the [dreyfusite] Intellectuals, 
  1898). The proletarian receives these representations (ideas, images, implicit 
  associations, myths) as he receives from capital the other aspects of his life. 
  Schematically speaking, the nineteenth century worker produced his ideas (even 
  reactionary ones) at the cafe, the bar or the club, while today's worker sees 
  his on television - a tendency which it would certainly be absurd to extrapolate 
  to the point of reducing to it all of reality. </p>
<p>Marx defined ideology as the substitute for a real but impossible change : 
  the change is lived at the level of the imaginary. Modern man is in this situation 
  as extended to every realm. He no longer transforms anything except into images. 
  He travels so as to rediscover the stereotype of the foreign country; loves 
  so as to play the role of the virile lover or the tender beloved etc. Deprived 
  of labor (transformation of environment and self) by wage-labor, the proletarian 
  lives the &quot;spectacle&quot; of change. </p>
<p>The present-day wage-worker does not live in &quot;abundance&quot; in relation 
  to the nineteenth-century worker who lived in &quot;poverty&quot;. The wage-worker 
  does not simply consume objects, but reproduces the economic and mental structures 
  which weigh on him. It is because of this, contrary to the opinion of <em>Invariance</em>, 
  that he cannot free himself of these representations except by suppressing their 
  material basis. He lives in a community of semiotics which force him to continue 
  : materially (credit), ideologically and psychologically (this community is 
  one of the few available). One does not only consume signs : the constraints 
  are as much, and first of all, economic (bills to be paid, etc.). Capital rests 
  on the production and sale of objects. That these objects also function as signs 
  (and sometimes as that above all) is a fact, but this never annuls their materiality. 
  Only intellectuals believe themselves to be living in a world made purely of 
  signs.</p><p class="subtitle">
  True and False </p>
<p>What are the consequences for the revolutionary movement of the &quot;the function 
  of social appearances in modern capitalism&quot; (I.S. 10, p. 79) ? As Marx 
  and Dejacque put it, communism has always been the dream of the world. Today, 
  the dream also serves not to change reality. One cannot content oneself with 
  &quot;telling&quot; the truth : this can only exist as practice, as relationship 
  between subject and object, saying and doing, expression and transformation, 
  and manifests itself as tension. The &quot;false&quot; is not a screen which 
  blocks the view. The &quot;true&quot; exists within the false, in Le Monde or 
  on television, and the &quot;false&quot; within the true, in texts which are 
  revolutionary or which claim to be. The false asserts itself through its practice, 
  by the use which it makes of the truth : the true is so only in transformation. 
  Revolutionary activity that locates itself in what it says on this side of what 
  the radio says is a semi-futility. Let us measure the gap between words and 
  reality. The S.I. demanded that revolutionaries not dazzle with words. Revolutionary 
  theory is not made revolutionary by itself, but by the capacity of those who 
  possess it to put it to subversive use not by a sudden flash, but by a mode 
  of presentation and diffusion which leaves traces, even if scarcely visible 
  ones. The denunciation of Leftists, for example, is secondary. Making it the 
  axis of activity leads to not dealing with fundamental questions for the purposes 
  of polemic against this or that group. Acting in this way modifies the content 
  of ideas and actions. One addresses the essential only through denunciations, 
  and the denunciation quickly becomes the essential. </p>
<p>Face to face with the multiplication of individuals and texts with radical 
  pretensions, the S.I. obliges one to ask : is this theory the product of a subversive 
  social relation seeking its expression, or a production of ideas being diffused 
  without contributing to a practical unification ? Everyone listens to the radio, 
  but radio sets unify proletarians in the service of capital - until the day 
  when these technical means are seized by revolutionary proletarians, at which 
  time one hour of broadcasting will be worth years of previous &quot;propaganda&quot;.</p>
<p>However, the &quot;end of ideology&quot; does not mean that there could be 
  a society without ideas, functioning automatically, like a machine : this would 
  presuppose a &quot;robotized&quot; and thus a non-&quot;human&quot; society, 
  since it would be deprived of the necessary reaction of its members. Having 
  become an ideology in the sense of The German Ideology, the imaginary develops 
  exactly along these lines. There is no dictatorship of social relations which 
  remote-controls us, without reaction and reflection on our part. This is a very 
  partial vision of &quot;barbarism&quot;. The mistake in descriptions of completely 
  totalitarian societies (Orwell's 1984 or the film THX 1138) is that they do 
  not see that all societies, even the most oppressive, presuppose the intervention 
  and action of human beings in their unfolding. Every society, including and 
  especially capitalist society, lives on these tensions, even though it risks 
  being destroyed by them. The critique of ideology denies neither the role of 
  ideas nor that of collective action in propagating them. </p>
<p class="subtitle"> The Theoretical Deadend of the Notion of the &quot;Spectacle&quot; </p>
<p> The notion of the spectacle unites a large number of given basic facts by 
  showing society- and thus its revolutionary transformation - as activity. Capitalism 
  does not &quot;mystify&quot; the workers. The activity of revolutionaries does 
  not demystify; it is the expression of a real social movement. The revolution 
  creates a different activity whose establishment is a condition of what classical 
  revolutionary theory called &quot;political&quot; tasks (destruction of the 
  State). </p>
<p>But the S.I. was not able to conceive in this way of the notion which it had 
  brought to light. It invested so much in this notion that it reconstructed the 
  whole of revolutionary theory around the spectacle. </p>
<p>In its theory of &quot;bureaucratic capitalism&quot;, Socialisme ou Barbarie 
  (S ou B) had capital rest on the bureaucracy. In its theory of &quot;spectacular 
  commodity society&quot;, the S.I. explained everything from the spectacle. One 
  does not construct a revolutionary theory except as a whole, and by basing it 
  on what is fundamental to social life. No, the question of &quot;social appearances&quot; 
  is not the key to any new revolutionary endeavor (I.S. #10, p. 79). </p>
<p>The traditional revolutionary groups had only seen new means of conditioning. 
  But for the S.I., the mode of expression of the &quot;media&quot; corresponds 
  to a way of life which did not exist a hundred years ago. Television does not 
  indoctrinate, but inscribes itself into a mode of being. The S.I. showed the 
  relationship between the form and foundation, where traditional marxism saw 
  nothing but new instruments in the service of the same cause. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the notion of the spectacle elaborated by the S.I. falls behind 
  what Marx and Engels understood by the term &quot;ideology&quot;. Debord's book 
  The Society of the Spectacle presents itself as an attempt to explain capitalist 
  society and revolution, when in fact it only considers their forms, important 
  but not determinant phenomena. It robes the description of them in a theorization 
  which gives the impression of a fundamental analysis, when in fact the method, 
  and the subject being studied, remain always at the level of social appearances. 
  At this level, the book is outstanding. The trouble is that it is written (and 
  read) as if one were going to find something in it that isn't there. While S 
  ou B analyzed the revolutionary problem by means of industrial sociology, the 
  S.I. analyzes it starting out from a reflection on the surface of society. This 
  is not to say that The Society of the Spectacle is superficial. Its contradiction 
  and, ultimately, its theoretical and practical dead-end, is to have made a study 
  of the profound, through and by means of the superficial appearance. The S.I. 
  had no analysis of capital : it understood it, but through its effects. It criticized 
  the commodity, not capital - or rather, it criticized capital as commodity, 
  and not as a system of valuation which includes production as well as exchange. 
</p>
<p>Throughout the book, Debord remains at the stage of circulation, lacking the 
  necessary moment of production, of productive labor. What nourishes capital 
  is not consumption, as he leads one to understand, but the formation of value 
  by labor. Debord is right to see more in the relation between appearance and 
  reality than in that between illusion and the reality, as if appearances did 
  not exist. But one never understands the real on the basis of the apparent. 
  Thus Debord does not complete his project. He does not show how capitalism makes 
  what is only the result into the cause or even into the movement. The critique 
  of political economy (which Debord does not make, content to ignore it as were 
  the utopians before him) shows how the proletarian sees standing over and against 
  him not only his product, but his activity. In the fetishism of commodities, 
  the commodity appears as its own movement. By the fetishism of capital, capital 
  takes on an autonomy which it does not possess, presenting itself as a living 
  being (Invariance is a victim of this illusion) : one does not know where it 
  comes from, who produces it, by what process the proletarian engenders it, by 
  what contradiction it lives and may die. Debord makes the spectacle into the 
  subject of capitalism, instead of showing how it is produced by capitalism. 
  He reduces capitalism to its spectacular dimension alone. The movement of capital 
  becomes the movement of the spectacle. . In the same way <em>Banalites de base</em> 
  makes a history of the spectacle through religion, myth, politics, philosophy, 
  etc. This theory remains limited to a part of the real relations, and goes so 
  far as to make them rest entirely on this part. </p>
<p>The spectacle is activity become passive. The S.I. rediscovered what Marx said 
  in the Grundisse about the rising-up of Man's being (his self-transformation, 
  his labor) as an alien power which crushes him : facing it, he no longer lives, 
  he only looks. The S.I. brought a new vigor to this theme. But capital is more 
  than pacification. It needs the intervention of the proletarian, as S ou B said. 
  The S.I.'s overestimation of the spectacle is the sign that it theorizes on 
  the basis of a social vision born at the periphery of society, and which it 
  believed to be central.</p>
<p class="subtitle"> The Spectacle and the Theory of Art </p>
<p>The theory of the spectacle expresses the crisis of the space-time outside 
  labor. Capital more and more creates a realm outside of labor according to the 
  logic of its economy : it does not develop leisure to control the masses, but 
  because it reduces living labor to a lesser role in production, diminishes labor-time, 
  and adds to the wage-worker's time of inactivity. Capital creates for the wage-workers 
  a space-time that is excluded, empty, because consumption never succeeds in 
  filling it completely. To speak of space-time is to insist on the fact that 
  there is a reduction in the working day, and that this freed time also occupies 
  a geographical and social space, in particular the street (c.f. the importance 
  of the city and of the derive for the S.I.). </p>
<p>This situation coincides with a dual crisis of &quot;art&quot;. Firstly, art 
  no longer has meaning because Western society doesn't know where it's going. 
  With 1914, the West lost the meaning and direction of civilization. Scientism, 
  liberalism and apologetics for the &quot;liberating&quot; effect of productive 
  forces went bankrupt like their adversaries (Romanticism, etc.). From then on, 
  art was to be tragic, narcissistic, or the negation of itself. In former periods 
  of crisis, one sought the meaning of the world : today, one doubts if it has 
  one. Secondly, the colonization of the market and the vain and frenzied search 
  for a &quot;direction&quot; enlist the artist in the service of consumption 
  outside of labor. </p>
<p>The S.I. is conscious of its social origin. Sur le passage de quelques personnes... 
  (1959), one of Debord's films, speaks of people &quot;on the margin of the economy.&quot; 
  On this terrain, like S ou B on the terrain of the enterprise, the S.I. understood 
  that modern capitalism tends to exclude people from all activity and at the 
  same time to engage them in a pseudo participation. But, like S ou B, it makes 
  a decisive criterion out of the contradiction between active and passive. Revolutionary 
  practice consists of breaking the very principle of the spectacle : non-intervention 
  (I.S. # 1, p. 110). At the end of the process, the workers council will be the 
  means of being active, of breaking down separation. Capital endures by the exclusion 
  of human beings, their passivity. What moves in the direction of a refusal of 
  passivity is revolutionary. Hence the revolutionary is defined by &quot;a new 
  style of life&quot; which will be an &quot;example&quot; (I. S. #6, p. 4). </p>
<p>The realm outside labor rests on bonds that are more contingent (c.f. the derive) 
  and subjective than wage labor, which belongs more to the necessary and the 
  objective. To the traditional economy, the S.I. opposes &quot;an economy of 
  desires&quot; (I.S. #7, p. 16); to necessity, it opposes freedom; to effort, 
  pleasure; to labor, the automation which makes it unnecessary; to sacrifice, 
  delight. The S.I. reverses the oppositions which must be superceded. Communism 
  does not free one from the necessity of labor, it overthrows &quot;labor&quot; 
  itself (as a separate and alien activity - Tr.). The S.I. identifies revolution 
  with a liberation from constraints, based on desire and first of all on the 
  desire for others, the need for relationships. It makes the link between &quot;situation&quot; 
  and &quot;labor&quot; badly, which limits its notion of the situation. It thinks 
  of society and its revolution from the context of non-wage-earning social layers. 
  Hence, it carries over onto the productive proletariat what it said about those 
  who are outside the wage system (street gangs, ghetto blacks). Because it was 
  ignorant of the center of gravity of the movement, the S.I. moved toward councilism 
  : the councils permit a &quot;direct and active communication&quot; (Society 
  of the Spectacle). The revolution appeared as the extension of the construction 
  of intersubjective situations to the whole of society. </p>
<p>The critique of the S.I. passes through the recognition of its &quot;avant-garde 
  artist&quot; aspect. Its sociological origin often provokes abusive and absurd 
  interpretations of the &quot;they were petty-bourgeois&quot; variety. The question 
  is clearly elsewhere. In the case of the S.I., it theorized from its own social 
  experience. The S.I.'s artistic origin is not a stigma in itself; but it leaves 
  its mark on theory and evolution when the group envisages the world from the 
  point of view of its specific social layer. - The passing to a revolutionary 
  theory and action that were general (no longer aimed only at art, urbanism, 
  etc.) corresponds to a precise logic on the S.I.'s part. The S.I. says that 
  each new issue of its journal can and must allow one to re-read all the previous 
  issues in a new way. This is indeed the characteristic of a theory which is 
  growing richer, being enriched, and the opposite of S ou B. It is not a matter 
  of., on one side the general aspect of the S.I., and on the other its more or 
  less critical relationship to art. The critique of separation was its guiding 
  thread. In art, as in the council, in self-management, in workers' democracy 
  and in organization (c.f. its Minimum definition of revolutionary organizations), 
  the S.I. wanted to break down separation, to create a real community. While 
  the S.I. refused &quot;questioning&quot; &aacute; la Cardan, it ended by adopting 
  the problematic of &quot;participation&quot; &aacute; la Chaulieu.</p>
<p class="subtitle"> The S.I. and <em>Socialisme ou Barbarie</em> </p>
<p>In order to attain &quot;the transparency of inter-subjective relations&quot;, 
  the S.I. wound up with the councilism supported by S ou B. The council is the 
  means of rediscovering unity. Debord met the S ou B through Canjuers and joined 
  it for several months. His membership was not mentioned in the S.I. journal. 
  On the contrary : La Veritable Scission, speaking of Khayati, excludes on principle 
  &quot;a double membership (in both the S.I. and another group) which would immediately 
  border on manipulation&quot; (p. 85). However that may be, Debord participated 
  in the activities of S ou B, throughout the time he was a member, notably taking 
  part in the team that was sent to Belgium during the great strike of 1960. At 
  the end of an international meeting organized by S ou B, which was at once deceptive 
  and revealing of the lack of perspectives, and which concluded with a pretentious 
  speech by Chaulieu on the tasks of S ou B, Debord announced his resignation. 
  Not without irony, he declared that he was in accord with the vast perspectives 
  outlined by Chaulieu, but that he did not feel equal to so immense a task. </p>
<p>I. S. #6 (1961) adopted the idea of the councils, if not councilism; in any 
  case it adopted the thesis of the division between &quot;order-givers&quot; 
  and &quot;order-takers&quot;. The project which the S.I. set for itself in I.S. 
  M, comprising among others &quot;the study without illusions of the classical 
  workers' movement&quot; andof Marx, was not to be realized. The S.I. was to 
  remain ignorant of the reality of the communist left, particularly Bordiga. 
  The most radical of the revolutionary movement would always be an improved S 
  ou B. It saw theory through this filter. </p>
<p>Vaneigem's <em>Banalites de base</em> cheerfully bypasses Marx. and rewrites 
  history in the light of S ou B, while adding to it the critique of the commodity. 
  The S.I. criticized S ou B but only in terms of degree : for the S.I., S ou 
  B limited socialism to workers management, while in fact it meant management 
  of everything. Chaulieu confined himself to the factory, Debord wanted to self-manage 
  life. Vaneigem's procedure is close to that of Cardan. He looks for a sign (evidence) 
  : no longer the shameless exploitation of workers on the shop-floor, but the 
  misery of social relationships, there is the revolutionary detonator : </p>
<p>The feeble quality of the spectacle and of everyday life becomes the only sign. 
</p>
<p><em>La Veritable Scission...</em> would also speak of a sign of what was unbearable. 
  Vaneigem is against vulgar marxism, but he does not integrate marxism into a 
  critique. He does not assimilate what was revolutionary about Marx that established 
  marxism has obliterated. In I.S. #9 (1963), the S.I. still acknowledged that 
  Cardan was &quot;in advance&quot; of it. </p>
<p>Like Society of the Spectacle, Banalities de base situates itself at the level 
  of ideology and its contradictions. Vaneigem shows how religion has become the 
  spectacle, which obliges revolutionary theory to criticize the spectacle as 
  it once had to start out from a critique of religion and philosophy. But in 
  this way one obtains only the (pre) condition of revolutionary theory : the 
  work remains to be done. The S.I. at first hoped for a lot from Lefebvre and 
  Cardan, then violently rejected them. But it kept in common with them the lack 
  of both a theory of capitalism and a theory of society. Toward 1960, it opened 
  up to new horizons but did not take the step. The S.I. confronted value (c.f. 
  Jorn's text on political economy and use value) but did not recognize it for 
  what it was. Its theory had neither centrality nor globality. This led it to 
  overestimate very diverse social movements, without seeing the kernel of the 
  problem. </p>
<p>It is, for example, incontestable that the article on Watts (#9, 1964) is a 
  brilliant theoretical breakthrough. Taking up in its own way what might have 
  been said about the exchange between Mauss and Bataille, the S.I. posed the 
  question of the modification of the very substance of capitalist society. The 
  article's conclusion even takes up once again Marx's formulation about the link 
  between Man and his generic nature, taken up at the same time by Camatte in 
  the P.C.I. (c.f. #1 of Invariance). But staying at the level of the commodity, 
  the S.I. was incapable of differentiating between the levels of society, and 
  of singling out what makes a revolution. When it writes that </p>
<p>&quot;a revolt against the spectacle situates itself at the level of the totality. 
  . .&quot; </p>
<p>it proves that it is making the spectacle into the totality. In the same way 
  its &quot;management-ist&quot; illusions led it to distort the facts concerning 
  Algeria after Boumedienne's coup d'etat : </p>
<p>&quot;The only program of the Algerians socialist elements is the defense of 
  the self-managed sector, not only as it is, but as it ought to be.&quot; (#9, 
  1964, p. 21). </p>
<p>In other words, without revolution, that is to say, without the destruction 
  of the State and key transformations in society, the S.I. believed that there 
  could be workers' management, and that revolutionaries should work for its extension.</p>
  <p class="subtitle">
  Positive Utopia </p>
<p>The S.I. allows the recognition at the level of revolutionary activity of the 
  implications of the development of capital since 1914, already recognized by 
  the communist left insofar as this development involved reformism, nations, 
  wars, the evolution of the state, etc. The S.I. had crossed the path of the 
  communist left. </p>
<p>The S.I. understood the communist movement and the revolution as the production 
  by the proletarians of new relations to each other and to &quot;things&quot;. 
  It rediscovered the Marxian idea of communism as the movement of self-creation 
  by men of their own relations. With the exception of Bordiga, it was the first 
  to connect again with the utopian tradition. This was at once its strength and 
  its ambiguity. </p>
<p>The S.I. was initially a revolt which sought to take back the cultural means 
  monopolized by money and power. Previously the most lucid artists had wanted 
  to break the separation between art and life : the S.I. raised this demand to 
  a higher level in their desire to abolish the distance between life and revolution. 
  &quot;Experimentation&quot; had been for surrealism an illusory means of wrenching 
  art out of its isolation from reality : the S.I. applied it in order to found 
  a positive utopia. The ambiguity comes from the fact that the S.I. did not know 
  exactly whether it was a matter of living differently from now on or only of 
  heading that way. </p>
<p>&quot;The culture to be overthrown will not really fall except along with the 
  totality of the socio-economic formation which upholds it. But, without further 
  ado, the S.I. proposes to confront it throughout its length and breadth, up 
  to and including the imposition of an autonomous situationist control and experimentation 
  against those who hold the existing cultural authority(ies), i.e. up to and 
  including a state of dual power within culture... The center of such a development 
  within culture would first of all have to be UNESCO once the S.I. had taken 
  command of it : a new type of popular university, detached from the old culture; 
  lastly, utopian centers to be built which, in relation to certain existing developments 
  in the social space of leisure, would have to be more completely liberated from 
  the ruling daily life ... would function as bridgeheads for a new invasion of 
  everyday life.&quot; (#5, 1960, pp. 5 &amp; 31). </p>
<p>The idea of a gradual liberation is coherent with that of a self-management 
  spreading everywhere little by little : it misunderstands society as a totality. 
  Besides this, it grants privilege to &quot;culture&quot;, the &quot;center of 
  meaning of a meaningless society&quot; (#5, p. 5). </p>
<p>This exaggeration of the role of culture was later to be carried over into 
  workers' autonomy : the &quot;power of the councils&quot; was supposed to spread 
  until it occupied the whole of society. These two traits have deep roots in 
  the origins of the S.I.. The problem, then, is not that the S.I. remained too 
  &quot;artistic&quot; in the Bohemian sense, lacking in &quot;rigor&quot; (as 
  if the &quot;Marxists&quot; were rigorous), but that it applied the same approach 
  throughout. </p>
<p>The projects for &quot;another&quot; life were legion in the S.I.. I.S. #6 
  (1961) dealt with an experimental town. At the Goteborg conference, Vaneigem 
  spoke of constructing situationist bases, in preparation for a unitary urbanism 
  and a liberated life. This speech (says the account of the proceeding) met with 
  no opposition (#7, 1962, p. 27). <br>
  One makes an organization : revolutionary groups &quot;have no right to exist 
  as a permanent vanguard unless they themselves set the example of a new style 
  of life.&quot; (#7, p. 16). The overestimation of organization and of the responsibility 
  of living differently now led, obviously, to a self-overestimation of the S.I.. 
  Trocchi declares in #7 : <br>
  &quot;We envisage a situation in which life is continually renewed by art, a 
  situation constructed by the imagination ... we have already gone through enough 
  experiences in a preparatory direction : we are ready to act.&quot; (pp. 50 
  &amp; 53). </p>
<p>A significant fact : the critique of this article in the following issue did 
  not pick up on this aspect (#8, pp. 3-5). Trocchi was to realize this program 
  in his own way in Project Sigma : the S.I. did not disavow it, but only stated 
  that Trocchi was not undertaking this project in his capacity as a member of 
  the S.I. (#9, p. 83). </p>
<p>The ambiguity was brought to a head by Vaneigem who in fact wrote a treatise 
  on how to live differently in the present world while setting forth what social 
  relations could be. It is a handbook to violating the logic of the market and 
  the wage system wherever one can get away with it. La Veritable Scission... 
  has some harsh words for Vaneigem and his book. Debord and Sanguinetti were 
  right to speak of &quot;exorcism&quot; : </p>
<p>&quot;He has said so as not to be&quot; (p. 143). </p>
<p>No doubt. But the critique is belated. Vaneigem's book was a difficult work 
  to produce because it cannot be lived, threatened with falling on the one hand 
  into a marginal possibilism and on the other into an imperative which is unrealizable 
  and thus moral. Either one huddles in the crevices of bourgeois society, or 
  one ceaselessly opposes to it a different life which is impotent because only 
  the revolution can make it a reality. The S.I. put the worst of itself into 
  its worst text. Vaneigem was the weakest side of the S.I., the one which reveals 
  all its weaknesses. The positive utopia is revolutionary as demand, as tension, 
  because it cannot be realized within this society : it becomes derisory when 
  one tries to live it today. Instead of hammering away at Vaneigem as an individual, 
  The Real Split... could have drawn up the balance sheet of the practice which 
  had produced Vaneigem, but there was no such balance sheet (see below). </p>
<p>The reformism of the everyday was later transferred to the level of work; arriving 
  late for work, writes Ratgeb is the beginning of a critique of wage labor. We 
  are not seeking to make fun of Vaneigem, unhappy theoretician of an art of living, 
  &quot;<em>la radicalit&eacute;</em>&quot;. His brio only succeeds in giving 
  the Treatise an empty pretension which makes one smile. The Real Split... is 
  ill inspired to mock the attitude of Vaneigem in May 1968, when he left for 
  his vacation as planned even though the &quot;events&quot; had begun (he quickly 
  returned). This personal contradiction reflected the theoretical and practical 
  contradiction sustained by the S.I. from its beginnings. Like every morality, 
  Vaneigem's position was untenable and had to explode on contact with reality. 
  The S.I. in denouncing his attitude gave itself over also to a moralistic practice 
  : it judged acts without examining their causes. This revelation of Vaneigem's 
  past, whether it troubles or amuses the radicalists, has besides something unpleasant 
  about it. If Vaneigem's inconsistency in 1968 was important, the S.I. should 
  have drawn conclusions from it, as it did not fail to do in a host of other 
  cases, and should not have waited until four years later to talk about it. If 
  Vaneigem's default was not important, it was useless to talk about it, even 
  when he broke with the S.I.. In fact the S.I., to use its own expression, exorcised 
  the impotence of its morality by denouncing the individuals who failed in upholding 
  this morality, thus saving at one blow both the morality and itself as the S.I.. 
  Vaneigem was the scapegoat for an impossible utopianism. </p>
<p class="subtitle">Materialism and Idealism in the S.I. </p>
<p>Against militant moralism, the S.I. extolled another morality : that of the 
  autonomy of individuals in the social group and in the revolutionary group. 
  Now, only an activity integrated into a social movement permits autonomy through 
  an effective practice. Otherwise the requirement of autonomy ends up by creating 
  an elite of those who know how to make themselves autonomous. Whoever says elitism 
  also says disciples. The S.I. showed a great organizational idealism, as did 
  Bordiga (the revolutionary as &quot;disintoxicated&quot;), even though the S.I. 
  resolved it differently. The S.I. had recourse to an immediate practical morality, 
  which illustrates its contradiction. Every morality puts on top of the given 
  social relations the obligation to behave in a way which runs counter to those 
  relations. In this case, the S.I.'s morality requires that one be respectful 
  of spontaneity. </p>
<p>The S.I.'s materialism is limited to the awareness of society as intersubjectivity, 
  as interaction of human relationships on the immediate plane, neglecting the 
  totality : but society is also the production of its own material conditions, 
  and the immediate relations crystallize into institutions, with the state at 
  their head. The &quot;creation of concrete situations&quot; is only one facet 
  of the revolutionary movement. In theorizing it, the S.I. does indeed start 
  out from the real conditions of existence, but reduces them to intersubjective 
  relations. This is the point of view of the subject trying to rediscover itself, 
  not a view which encompasses both subject and object. It is the &quot;subject&quot; 
  stripped of its &quot;representation&quot;. The systematization of this opposition 
  in The Society of the Spectacle takes up again the idealist opposition characterized 
  by its forgetting of Man's objectifications (labor, appropriation of the world, 
  fusion of Man and nature). The subject-object opposition is the guiding thread 
  of Western philosophy, formed in a world whose meaning Man sees escaping him 
  little by little. Already Descartes was setting side by side the progress of 
  mathematics and the stagnation of metaphysics. Mercantile Man is in search of 
  his role. </p>
<p>The S.I. was not interested in production. It reproached Marx for being too 
  economistic, but did not itself make a critique of political economy. Society 
  is an ensemble of relations which assert themselves by objectifying themselves, 
  creating material or social objects (institutions); the revolution destroys 
  capitalism by a human action at the level of its objectifications (system of 
  production, classes, state) carried out precisely by those who are at the center 
  of these relations. </p>
<p>Debord is to Freud what Marx is to Hegel : he founds what is only a materialist 
  theory of personal relationships, a contradiction in terms. Instead of starting 
  from the ensemble of social relations, the notion of the &quot;construction 
  of situations&quot; isolates the relation between subjects from the totality 
  of relations. In the same way as, for Debord, the spectacle says all there is 
  to be said about capitalism, the revolution appears as the construction of situations 
  expanded to the whole of society. The S.I. did not grasp the mediations on which 
  society rests; and foremost among these, labor, the &quot;fundamental need&quot; 
  (William Morris) of Man. As a consequence of this, it did not clearly discern 
  the mediations on the basis of which a revolution can be made. To get out of 
  the difficulty it exaggerated the mediation of the organization. Its councilist, 
  democratic and self-management-ist positions are explained by its ignorance 
  of the social dynamic. </p>
<p>The S.I. insisted on forms of organization to remedy the inadequacy of the 
  content which escaped it. Practicing &quot;the inversion of the genitive&quot; 
  like Marx in his early work, it put things back on their feet : inverting the 
  terms of ideology so as to understand the world in its reality. But a real understanding 
  would be more than an inversion : Marx was not content to turn Hegel and the 
  Young Hegelians upside down. </p>
<p>The S.I. only saw capital in the form of the commodity, ignoring the cycle 
  as a whole. Of Capital, Debord only retains the first sentence, without understanding 
  it : capital presents itself as an accumulation of commodities, but it is more 
  than that. The S.I. saw the revolution as a calling into question more of the 
  relations of distribution (c.f. the Watts riot) than of the relations of production. 
  It was acquainted with the commodity but not with surplus value. </p>
<p>The S.I. showed that the communist revolution could not be only an immediate 
  attack on the commodity. This contribution is decisive. Although the Italian 
  Left had described communism as the destruction of the market, and had already 
  broken with the ideology of the productive forces, it had not understood the 
  formidable subversive power of concretely communist measures. Bordiga, in fact, 
  pushes social communization back beyond a seizure of &quot;political power&quot;. 
  The S.I. viewed the revolutionary process at the level of human relations. Even 
  the State cannot be destroyed strictly on the military plane. The mediation 
  of society, it is also (but not) solely destroyed by the demolition of the capitalist 
  social relations which uphold it. </p>
<p>The S.I. ended up with the opposite mistake to Bordiga's. The latter reduced 
  the revolution to the application of a program : the former limited it to an 
  overthrow of immediate relations. Neither Bordiga nor the S.I. perceived the 
  whole problem. The one conceived a totality abstracted from its real measures 
  and relations, the other a totality without unity or determination hence an 
  addition of particular points extending itself little by little. Incapable of 
  theoretically dominating the whole process, they both had recourse to an organizational 
  palliative to ensure the unity of the process - the party for Bordiga, the councils 
  for the S.I.. In practice, while Bordiga depersonalized the revolutionary movements 
  to the point of excess, the S.I. was an affirmation of individuals to the point 
  of elitism. Although it was totally ignorant of Bordiga, the S.I. allows one 
  to develop Bordiga's thesis on the revolution further by means of a synthesis 
  with its own. </p>
<p>The S.I. itself was not able to realize this synthesis, which presupposes an 
  all-round vision of what society is. It practiced positive utopianism only for 
  the purpose of revelation, and that is without doubt its theoretical stumbling 
  block. </p>
<p>&quot;What must happen ... in the centers of unequally shared but vital experience 
  is a demystification.&quot; (#7, p. 48). </p>
<p>There was a society of &quot;the spectacle&quot;, a society of &quot;false 
  consciousness&quot;, as opposed to the supposedly classical capitalism of the 
  19th century : it was a matter of giving it a time consciousness of itself. 
  The S.I. never separated itself from Lukacsian idealism, as is shown by the 
  only critique of the S.I. which has appeared up to the present : Supplement 
  au no. 301 de la Nouvelle Gazette Rhenane. Lukacs knew (with the help of Hegel 
  and Marx) that capitalism is the loss of unity, the dispersion of consciousness. 
  But, instead of concluding from this that the proletarians will recompose a 
  unitary world view by means of their subversive practice (concluding in the 
  revolution), he thought that consciousness must be re-unified and rediscovered 
  first in order for this subversion to happen. As this is impossible he too fled 
  back into magic and theorized the need for a concretization of consciousness 
  which must be incarnated in an organization before the revolution is possible. 
  This organized consciousness is the &quot;party&quot;. One sees immediately 
  that, for Lukacs, the justification of the party is secondary : what is primary 
  is the idealism of consciousness, the primacy accorded to consciousness of which 
  the party is only the manifestation. What is essential in his theory is that 
  consciousness must be incarnated in an organization. The S.I. takes up in an 
  uncritical way Lukacs' theory of consciousness but replaces the &quot;party&quot; 
  with the S.I. on side and the councils on the other. For the S.I., as for Lukacs, 
  the difference between &quot;class in itself&quot; and &quot;class for itself&quot; 
  is that the latter possesses class consciousness. That this consciousness would 
  not be brought to it by a party, but would spring spontaneously from the organization 
  of the workers into councils is quite secondary. The S.I. conceived of itself 
  as an organization destined to make the truth burst forth : it made revelation 
  the principle of its action. This explains the inordinate importance which the 
  S.I. saw in the tendency toward &quot;total democracy&quot; in 1968. Democracy 
  is the perfect place for consciousnesses to elucidate themselves. Everything 
  is summed up in the S.I.'s definition of a proletarian as one who &quot;has 
  no control over the use of his life and who knows it&quot;. </p>
<p>Art is today voluntary alienation; in it the systematic practice of artifice 
  renders more visible the facticity of life. Shutting itself in its idea of the 
  &quot;spectacle&quot;, the S.I. remained a prisoner of its origins. The Society 
  of the Spectacle is already a completed book. The theory of appearances turns 
  back on itself. Here one can even read the beginnings of currently fashionable 
  ideas about capital as representation. Capital becomes image... the concentrated 
  result of social labor... becomes apparent and submits the whole of reality 
  to appearance. </p>
<p>The S.I. was born at the same moment as all the theses about &quot;communication&quot; 
  and language and in reaction against them, but it mostly tended to pose the 
  same problem in different terms. The S.I. was formed as a critique of communication, 
  and never departed from this point of origin : the council realizes a &quot;true&quot; 
  communication. In spite of this, unlike Barthes and his ilk, the S.I. refused 
  to let the sign turn back on itself. It did not want to study apparent reality 
  (the study of &quot;mythologies&quot; or of the &quot;superstructures&quot; 
  dear to Gramsci's heart) but rather reality as appearance. Marx wrote in 1847 
  : </p>
<p>&quot;Human activity = commodity. The manifestation of life, active life, appears 
  as a mere means : appearance, separate from this activity, is grasped as an 
  end in itself.&quot; <br>
  The S.I. itself succumbed to fetishism in fixating itself on forms : commodity, 
  subject, organization, consciousness. But unlike those who today repeat its 
  ideas while conserving only the flashy parts and the mistakes (utopia, etc.), 
  the S.I. did not make it a rule to confuse language with society. What was for 
  the S.I. a contradiction became the raison d'&ecirc;tre of modernism. </p>
<p class="subtitle">No Theoretical Summingup </p>
<p>Nothing is easier than a false summing-up. One can even do it over, like the 
  famous self-criticism, every time one changes one's ideas. One renounces the 
  old system of thought so as to enter the new one, but one does not change one's 
  mode of being. The &quot;theoretical summing-up&quot; can be in fact the most 
  deceitful practice while appearing to be the most honest. The Real Split... 
  succeeds in not talking about the S.I. and its end, except so as not to grapple 
  with its conceptions - in a word, it talks about it non-theoretically. Denouncing 
  (no doubt sincerely) triumphalism and self-sufficiency in relation to the S.I. 
  and in the S.I. but without a theoretical critique, the book ends up presenting 
  the S.I. as a model. Debord and Sanguinetti don't get to the point except with 
  the pro-situs, who inspired them to some good reflections, but still at the 
  level of subjective relations, of attitudes. Theory is always seen from the 
  standpoint of attitudes which incarnate it; an important dimension certainly, 
  but not an exclusive one. </p>
<p>There is no self-analysis of the S.I.. The S.I. came, 1968 announces the return 
  of the revolution, now the S.I. is going to disappear so as to be reborn everywhere. 
  This lucid modesty masks two essential points : the authors argue as though 
  the SIs perspective had been totally correct; they do not ask themselves whether 
  there might not be a link between the sterility of the S.I. after 1968 (c.f. 
  the correspondence of the Orientation Debate) and the insufficiency of that 
  perspective. Even on the subject of the pro-situs, Debord and Sanguinetti fail 
  to establish any logical relation between the S.I. and its disciples. The S.I. 
  was revolutionary with the aid of a theory based on attitudes (which would later 
  prove to be a brake on its evolution). After the phase of revolutionary action, 
  the pro-situ retained nothing but the attitude. One cannot judge a master solely 
  by his disciples : but he also has, in p art, disciples he has called forth. 
  The S.I. accepted the role of master involuntarily, through its very conceptions. 
  It did not directly propose a savoir-vivre, but in presenting its ideas as a 
  &quot;savoir-vivre&quot; it pushed an art of living on its readers. The Real 
  Split... registers the ideological use to which I.S. was put, its being turned 
  into a spectacle, says the book, by half the readers of the journal. This was 
  partly inevitable (see below on recuperation) but in part also due to its own 
  nature. Every radical theory or movement is recuperated by its weaknesses : 
  Marx, by his study of the economy in-itself and his radical-reformist tendencies, 
  the German Left by its councilism, etc. Revolutionaries remain revolutionaries 
  by profiting from these recuperations, eliminating their limitations so as to 
  advance toward a more developed totalization. The Real Split... is also a split 
  in the minds of its authors. Their critique of Vaneigem is made as if his ideas 
  were foreign to the S.I.. To read Debord and Sanguinetti, one would think that 
  the S.I. had no responsibility for the Traite : Vaneigem's weakness, one would 
  think, belongs to him alone. One or the other : either the S.I. did indeed take 
  his faults into account - in which case why didn't it say something about them 
  ? - or else it ignored them. The S.I. here inaugurates a practice of organization 
  (which S ou B would have qualified with the word &quot;bureaucratic&quot; ) 
  : one does not learn of the deviations of members until after their exclusion. 
  The organization retains its purity, the errors of its members do not affect 
  it. The trouble comes from the insufficiencies of the members, never from on 
  high, and not from the organization. As the eventual megalomania of the leaders 
  does not explain everything, one is obliged to see in this behavior the sign 
  of a mystified coming-to-consciousness of the group's impasse, and of a magical 
  way of solving it. Debord was the S.I.. He dissolved it : this would have been 
  proof of a lucid and honest attitude if he had not at the same time eternized 
  it. He dissolved the S.I. so as to make it perfect, as little open to criticism 
  as he was little able to criticize it himself. </p>
<p>In the same way, his film Society of the Spectacle is an excellent means of 
  eternizing his book. Immobilism goes side by side with the absence of summing-up. 
  Debord had learned nothing. The book was a partial theorization : the film totalizes 
  it. This sclerosis is even more striking in what was added for the film's re-release 
  in 1976. Debord replies to a series of criticisms of the film, but says not 
  a word about various people (some of them very far removed from our own conceptions) 
  who judged the film severely from a revolutionary point of view. He prefers 
  to take on Le Nouvel Observateur. [16] More and more, his problem is to defend 
  his past. He runs aground of necessity, because all he can do is re-interpret 
  it. The S.I. no longer belongs to him. The revolutionary movement will assimilate 
  it in spite of the situationists. <br>
  A left-wing intellectual French weekly. </p>
<p class="subtitle">An Exercise in Style </p>
<p>Otherwise serious, Sanguinetti's book Veridique Rapport is still a mark of 
  his failure (echec). We will not judge the book by its public, which appreciates 
  it as a good joke played on the bourgeoisie. These readers are content to repeat 
  that the capitalists are cretins, even that they are contemptible compared to 
  &quot;real&quot; ruling classes of the past; if we wanted to, they say, we could 
  be far bigger and better bourgeois. Elitism and scorn for capitalism are derisory 
  enough as reactions, but reassuring when revolution does not appear any longer 
  to be an absolute certainty. But complacency in the denunciation of bourgeois 
  decadence is far from being subversive. It is shared by those (like Sorel) who 
  scorn the bourgeoisie while wanting to save capitalism. The cultivation of this 
  attitude is thus absurd in anyone who has the slightest revolutionary pretensions. 
  Let us admit in any case that Sanguinetti scored a good shot. </p>
<p>The problem most commentators fail to deal with (and for good reason) is to 
  know whether he puts forward a revolutionary perspective. If he does not he 
  has only succeeded in letting off a firecracker within bourgeois politics and 
  the game of the parties. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. His analysis 
  of past events is false, and so is the revolutionary perspective he proposes. 
</p>
<p>First of all, there was no &quot;social war&quot; in Italy in 1969 nor in Portugal 
  in 1976. May 1968 in France was the upsurge of a vast spontaneous workers' organization 
  : on the scale of a whole country, and in hundreds of big enterprises, proletarians 
  partook at the same moment of the &quot;proletarian experience&quot;, of confrontation 
  with the state and the unions, and understood in acts that working-class reformism 
  only serves capital. This experience will remain. It was an indispensable break, 
  and a lasting one even though the wound now seems to have been closed again. 
</p>
<p>But the S.I. took this break for the revolution itself. 1968 realized for it 
  what 1966 realized for S ou B : the practical verification of its theory, in 
  fact the confirmation of its limits and the beginning of its getting tangled 
  up. La Veritable Scission... asserts that the occupation movement [18] had situationist 
  ideas : when one knows that almost all the strikers left control of the strike 
  to the unions, unless one mythologizes the occupation movement, this shows only 
  the limits of situationist ideas. This ignorance of the state on the part of 
  the movement was not a supersession of jacobinism, but its corollary, as it 
  was in the Commune : the non-destruction of the state, its simple democratization, 
  went side by side in 1871 with an attempt by some people to create a dictatorship 
  on the model of 1793. It is true that looking at 1871 or 1968 - one would have 
  to show the strength and not the weakness of the communist movement, its existence 
  rather than its absence. Otherwise the revolutionary only develops a superior 
  pessimism and an abstract negation of everything which is not &quot;the revolution&quot;. 
  But the revolutionary movement is such only if it criticizes itself, insisting 
  on the global perspective, on what was missing in past proletarian movements. 
  It does not valorize the past. It is the state and the counterrevolution that 
  take up the limits of past movements and make their program out of them. Theoretical 
  communism criticizes previous experiences, but also distinguishes between proletarian 
  assault as in Germany in 1918-21, and attacks that were immediately bogged down 
  by capital as in 1871 and in Spain in 1936. It is not content to describe positive 
  movements, but also indicates the ruptures which they had to effect in order 
  to make the revolution. The S.I. did the opposite. Moreover, starting in 1968, 
  it theorized a rising revolution. But above all it denied the question of the 
  state. </p>
<p>&quot;When the workers are able to assemble freely and without mediations to 
  discuss their real problems, the state begins to dissolve.&quot; (The Real Split, 
  p.33). </p>
<p>All of anarchism is there. Far from wanting, as one would expect, to demolish 
  the state, anarchism is most precisely characterized by its indifference to 
  it. Contrary to that &quot;Marxism&quot; which puts foremost and above all else 
  the necessity of &quot;taking power&quot;, anarchism in fact consists of a neglect 
  of the question of state power. The revolution unfolds, committees and assemblies 
  form parallel to the state, which, emptied of its power, collapses of its own 
  accord. Founded on a materialist conception of society, revolutionary marxism 
  asserts that capital is not only a soda, spread out thinly everywhere, but that 
  it is also concentrated in institutions (and first of all armed force) which 
  are endowed with a certain autonomy, and which never die by themselves. The 
  revolution only triumphs by bringing against them an action at once generalized 
  and concentrated. The military struggle is based on the social transformation, 
  but has its own specific role. The S.I. for its part, gave way to anarchism, 
  and exaggerated the importance of workers' assemblies (in 1968, Pouvoir Ouvrier 
  and the Groupe de Liaison pour l'Action des Travailleurs were also preoccupied 
  essentially with calling for democratic workers' assemblies). </p>
<p>In the same way, to say that in Portugal the pressure of the workers hindered 
  the construction of the modem capitalist state, is to have only the viewpoint 
  of the state, of capital. Is capital's problem to develop in Portugal, to constitute 
  a new and powerful pole of accumulation there ? Wasn't the objective of the 
  &quot;revolution of the carnations&quot; to channel confused popular and proletarian 
  aspirations toward illusory reforms, so that the proletariat would remain quiescent 
  ? Mission accomplished. It is not a matter of a half-victory for the proletariat, 
  but of an almost total defeat, in which the &quot;proletarian experience&quot; 
  was almost non-existent, because there was not, so to speak, any direct confrontation, 
  any alignment of proletarians around a position opposed to capitalism. They 
  never stopped supporting the democratized state, even at times against the parties, 
  which they accused of &quot;treason&quot;. </p>
<p>Neither in Italy in 1969, nor in Portugal in 1974-5, was there a &quot;social 
  war&quot;. What is a social war if not a head-on struggle between classes, calling 
  into question the foundations of society -- wage labor, exchange, the state 
  ? There was not even the beginning of a confrontation between classes, and between 
  the proletariat and the state in Italy and Portugal. In 1969, the strike movements 
  sometimes spread into riots but not every riot is the beginning of the revolution. 
  The conflicts born of demands could become violent and could even provoke the 
  beginning of a struggle against the forces of Order. But the degree of violence 
  does not indicate the content of the struggle. In battling the police, the workers 
  continued to believe no less in a leftwing government. They called for a &quot;real 
  democratic state&quot; against the conservative forces supposedly dominating 
  it. </p>
<p>Explaining the failure of the &quot;social war&quot; by the presence of the 
  C.P.s is as serious as attributing everything to the absence of the party. Should 
  one ask whether the German revolution miscarried in 1919 because of the S.P.D. 
  and the unions ? Or should one rather ask why the S.P.D. and the unions existed, 
  why the workers continued to support them ? One must begin from inside the proletariat. 
</p>
<p>Certainly, it is comforting to see a book which presents the C.P. as one of 
  the pillars of capitalism undergo a wide distribution. But this success is ambiguous. 
  If capital no longer has any all-encompassing thought, or even no thinkers at 
  all (which is in any case incorrect), the S.I. thinks well enough in its place, 
  but badly for the proletariat, as we shall see. Sanguinetti finishes by reasoning 
  in capitalist terms. In fact, he has constructed an analysis such as a capitalist 
  who had assimilated vulgar marxism would have. It is the bourgeoisie who speak 
  of revolution where there is none. For them, occupied factories and barricades 
  in the streets are the beginning of a revolution. Revolutionary marxism does 
  not take the appearance for reality, the moment for the whole. The &quot;heaviness&quot; 
  of marxism is preferable to a lightness without content. But let us leave the 
  readers to choose according to what motivates their reading. </p>
<p>The S.I. has succeeded at an exercise in style : the final verdict for a group 
  that mocked the cult of style in a style-less world. It has come in the end 
  to play capitalist, in every sense of the word. Its brilliance is unimpaired, 
  but it has nothing else left but brilliance. The S.I. gives good advice to capitalists 
  and bad advice to proletarians, to whom it proposes nothing but councilism. 
</p>
<p>Veridique rapport contains two ideas : (i) the governmental participation of 
  the C.P. is indispensable to Italian capitalism; (ii) the revolution is the 
  workers' councils. The second idea is false, the first one true; capitalists 
  like Agnelli have also expressed it. In a word, Sanguinetti manages to grasp 
  the totality as a bourgeois and nothing more. </p>
<p>He wanted to pass himself off as an enlightened bourgeois : he has succeeded 
  all too well. He has beaten himself at his own game. </p>
<p class="subtitle">Recuperation </p>
<p>At the same moment, Jaime Semprun, the author of La Guerre sociale au Portugal, 
  published a Precis de recuperation. Here is what the S.I. once said about &quot;recuperation&quot; 
  : </p>
<p>&quot;It is quite normal that our enemies should come to use us partially... 
  just like the proletariat, we do not pretend to be unexploitable under present 
  conditions.&quot; (I.S. #9. p. 4). </p>
<p>&quot;The vital concepts undergo at one and the same time the truest and most 
  lying uses ... because the struggle of critical reality against apologetic spectacle 
  leads us to a struggle over words, a struggle the more bitter as the words are 
  more central. It is not an authoritarian purge, but the coherence of a concept's 
  use in theory and in practical life which reveals its truth.&quot; (I.S. #10, 
  p. 82). </p>
<p>The counterrevolution does not take up revolutionary ideas because it is malign 
  or manipulative, let alone short of ideas, but because revolutionary ideas deal 
  with real problems with which the counterrevolution is confronted. It is absurd 
  to launch into a denunciation of the enemy's use of revolutionary themes or 
  notions. Today, all terms, all concepts are perverted. The subversive movement 
  will only reappropriate them by its own practical and theoretical development. 
</p>
<p>Since the end of the 19th century, capitalism and the workers' movement have 
  engendered a fringe of thinkers who take up revolutionary ideas only so as to 
  empty them of their subversive content and adapt them to capital. The bourgeoisie 
  has, by nature, a limited vision of the world. It must call on the vision of 
  the class, the proletariat, which is the bearer of another project. This phenomenon 
  has been amplified since marxism has been officially recognized as having public 
  usefulness. During the first period, capital drew from it a sense of the unity 
  of all relations and of the importance of the economy (in the sense in which 
  Lukacs rightly said that capitalism produces a fragmented vision of reality). 
  But to the extent that capitalism comes to dominate the whole of life, this 
  vision -- broadly speaking, that of old-fashioned economistic vulgar marxism 
  -- is inadequate to its complexity and to the extension of conflicts to all 
  its levels. During the second period, the one we are living in today, determinist 
  orthodox marxism has been rejected by the bourgeoisie itself. At the universities, 
  it was good fun to shrug one's shoulders at Capital fifty years ago : around 
  1960, it became permissible to find &quot;interesting ideas&quot; in it, the 
  more so as they were being &quot;applied&quot; in the U.S.S.R.... To be in fashion 
  today, it is enough to say that Capital is in the rationalist and reductionist 
  tradition of Western philosophy since Descartes, or even since Aristotle. The 
  new official marxism is not an axis; instead one puts a little bit of it everywhere. 
  It serves to remind one of the &quot;social&quot; character of all practice 
  : the &quot;recuperation&quot; of the S.I. is only a particular case. </p>
<p>One of the natural channels of this evolution is the university, since the 
  apparatus of which it is a part backs a considerable part of the research on 
  the modernization of capitaL Official &quot;revolutionary&quot; thought is the 
  scouting party of capital. Thousands of appointed functionaries criticize capitalism 
  from every direction. </p>
<p>Modernism expresses the social crisis of which the crisis of the proletariat 
  is only an aspect. Out of the limits which the subversive movement encounters 
  at every step, modernism makes its objectives. It serves in particular to justify 
  immediate reformism at the social level. In fact, traditional working class 
  reformism no longer needs justification inasmuch as it has become the rule. 
  The reformism of customs and daily life still needs to be theorized, both against 
  the revolutionary movement from which issues the bias toward it, and against 
  backward capitalist fractions which reject liberties that are nonetheless inoffensive 
  to capital. Modernism thus gets developed because it helps capital to free itself 
  from the fetters on capitalist liberty. The reformism of the everyday is still 
  in its ascendant phase, as economic and working class reformism was seventy 
  years ago. </p>
<p>The common trait of all modernism is the taking up of revolutionary theory 
  by halves; basically its approach is that of &quot;marxism&quot; as against 
  Marx. Its axiom is to call, not for revolution, but for liberation from a certain 
  number of constraints. It wants the maximum of freedom within the existing society. 
  Its critique will always be that of the commodity and not of capital, of politics 
  and not of the state. of totalitarianism and not of democracy. Is it by accident 
  that its historical representative, Marcuse, came from a Germany forced to turn 
  away from the radical aspirations revealed in 1917-21 ? </p>
<p>It is conceivable to denounce deformations in revolutionary theory in order 
  to make things absolutely precise - on the condition, however, that there is 
  more than just a denunciation. In Semprun's book, there is not an ounce of theory 
  to be found. Let us take two examples. In his critique of G. Guegan, Semprun 
  shows what he considers important. Why demolish this personage ? To demarcate 
  oneself, even with violent language, has no meaning unless one Puts oneself 
  at a higher level. Semprun spreads Guegan's life over several pages. But if 
  it is really necessary to talk about Guegan, there is something that must be 
  got straight concerning Cahiers du futur (Future Notebooks), the journal he 
  edited. If the first issue was uselessly pretentious, the second, devoted to 
  the counter-revolution, is particularly detestable. It presents the fact that 
  the counter-revolution feeds on the revolution as a paradox, takes pleasure 
  in pointing out the mix-up without explaining anything, as something to revel 
  in amid complacently morbid drawings, and sends everybody into a tailspin. This 
  (intentional ?) derision for all revolutionary activity mixes in a little more 
  and fosters a feeling of superiority among those who have understood because 
  they have been there : &quot;That's where revolution leads. . . &quot; (read 
  : &quot;That's what I was when I was a militant . . . &quot; One can only dream 
  of what the S.I. in its prime might have written about this. </p>
<p>Semprun also shows how Castoriadis has innovated in taking it upon himself 
  to &quot;recuperate&quot; his own past revolutionary texts, striving to make 
  them unreadable by heaping them with prefaces and footnotes. This is amusing 
  at first sight, but becomes less so when one knows what the S.I. owes to S ou 
  B. Semprun even shows condescension toward Chaulieu's &quot;marxist&quot; period. 
  The ultra-left was indeed dry as dust, but not enough to stop Debord from joining 
  it. Whether one likes it or not, this is falsification : one amuses the reader 
  while making him forget what the S.I.'s bankruptcy owes to Chaulieu before he 
  went bankrupt himself. </p>
<p>In these two cases as in others, individuals are judged by their attitude, 
  not by their theoretical evolution, from which one might profit. Semprun presents 
  us with a gallery of moral portraits. He does not analyze, he judges. He pillories 
  a number of assholes who stole from the S.I.. Criticizing these attitudes, he 
  is himself nothing but an attitude. </p>
<p>Like every moralistic practice, this one leads to some monstrosities. The most 
  striking is the aggravation of the practice of organization already mentioned 
  in relation to The Real Split... As Debord's new bodyguard, Semprun settles 
  accounts with former members of the S.I.. Reading these works, the uninitiated 
  wouldn't think that the S.I. was ever much of anything. Busy with his self-destruction, 
  Debord now unleashes a sectarianism which reveals his fear of the world. Semprun's 
  style can thus only insult everything that comes within its scope and which 
  is not Debord. He is nothing but a demarcation. He does not know either how 
  to approve or to scorn. Of radical criticism, he has retained only the contempt. 
</p>
<p class="subtitle">Spectacle </p>
<p>The S.I. always valued its trademark and did its own publicity. One of its 
  great weaknesses was wanting to appear to be without weaknesses, without faults, 
  as if it had developed the Superman within itself. Today it is no more than 
  that. As a critique of traditional groups and of militantism, the S.I. played 
  at being an International, turning politics into derision. The rejection of 
  the pseudo-serious militant who achieves only the spirit of the cloister today 
  serves to evade serious problems. Voyer practices derision only to become derisory 
  himself. The proof that the S.I. is finished is that it continues in this form. 
  As a critique of the spectacle, the S.I. shows off its bankruptcy by making 
  a spectacle of itself, and ends up as the opposite of what it was born for. 
</p>
<p>For this reason, the S.I. continues to be appreciated by a public in desperate 
  need of radicality of which it retains only the letter and the tics. Born from 
  a critique of art, the S.I. winds up being used (despite and because of itself) 
  as a work of literature. One takes pleasure in reading the S.I. or its successors, 
  or the classics which it appreciated, as others take pleasure in listening to 
  the Doors. In the period when the S.I. was really searching and self-searching, 
  when the practice of derision clothed real theoretical and human progression, 
  when humor did not serve merely as a mask, the S.I.'s style was much less fluid 
  and facile than that of these current writings. The rich text resists its author 
  as well as its readers. The text which is nothing but style flows smoothly. 
</p>
<p>The S.I. contributed to the revolutionary common good, and its weaknesses also 
  have become fodder for a public of monsters, who are neither workers nor intellectuals, 
  and who do nothing. Barren of practice, of passion, and often of needs, they 
  have nothing between them but psychological problems. When people come together 
  with out doing anything, they have nothing in common but their subjectivity. 
  The S.I. is necessary to them; in its work, they read the ready-made theoretical 
  justification for their interest in these relations. The S.I. gives them the 
  impression that the essential reality resides in immediate intersubjective relations, 
  and that revolutionary action consists in developing a radicality at this level, 
  in particular in escaping from wage labor, which coincides with their existence 
  as d&eacute;class&eacute;s The secret of this radicality consists of rejecting 
  everything that exists (including the revolutionary movement) so as to oppose 
  to it whatever seems farthest away from it (even if this has nothing revolutionary 
  about it). This pure opposition has nothing revolutionary about it but the words. 
  The life-style has its rules, which are just as constricting as those of the 
  &quot;bourgeois&quot; world. Most often, bourgeois values are Inverted in apologetics 
  for not working, for marginal existence, for everything that seems to transgress. 
  Leftism makes apologetics for the proletariat as something positive in this 
  society : the pro-situs glorify themselves (as proletarians) as pure negation. 
  As for the ones who have some theoretical substance, their watchword is always 
  the &quot;critique of the S.I.&quot;, a critique which is impossible for them 
  because it would be also the critique of their milieu. <br>
  The vigor of the S.I. was not in its theory but in a theoretical and practical 
  exigency which its theory only partially recovered, which it helped to locate. 
  The S.I. was the affirmation of the revolution. Its rise coincided with a period 
  when it was possible to think that there would be a revolution soon. It was 
  not equipped to survive past that period. It was successful as the self-critique 
  of a social stratum incapable of making the revolution by itself, and which 
  denounced this stratum's own pretensions (as represented for example, by leftism 
  which wants workers to be led by &quot;conscious&quot; drop-outs from the middle 
  class). </p>
<p class="subtitle">Radical Subjectivity </p>
<p>The S.I. had in relation to classical revolutionary marxism (of which Chaulieu 
  was a good example) the same function, and the same limits, as Feuerbach had 
  in relation to Hegelianism. To escape from the oppressive dialectic of alienation/ 
  objectification, Feuerbach constructed an anthropological vision which placed 
  Man, and in particular love and the senses, at the center of the world. To escape 
  from the economism and factory-fetishism (usinisme) of the ultra-left; the S.I. 
  elaborated a vision of which human relations were the center and which is consonant 
  with &quot;reality&quot;, is materialist, if these relations are given their 
  full weight so that they include production, labor. Feuerbachian anthropology 
  prepared the way for theoretical communism such as Marx was able to synthesize 
  during his own time, via the transition of the 1844 Manuscripts. In the same 
  way, the theory of &quot;situations&quot; has been integrated into a vision 
  of communism of which the S.I. was incapable such as is shown today in Un monde 
  sans argent.</p>
<p>For the same reason, Debord read Marx in the light of Cardan, considering the 
  &quot;mature&quot; Marx to have been submerged in political economy, which is 
  false. Debord's vision of communism is narrow in comparison to the whole problem. 
  The S.I. did not see the human species and its reconciliation with Nature. It 
  was limited to a very Western, industrial urban universe. It located automation 
  wrongly. It spoke of &quot;dominating nature&quot; which also bespeaks the influence 
  of S ou B. When it dealt with material conditions, in relation to the organization 
  of space, it was still a matter of &quot;relations between people&quot;. S ou 
  B was limited by the enterprise, the S.I. by subjectivity. It went as far as 
  it could, but on its original trajectory. Theoretical communism is more than 
  a revolutionary anthropology. The 1844 Manuscripts assimilate Feuerbach's vision 
  by putting Man back into the totality of his relations. </p>
<p>The S.I. owed a great deal to the texts of the young Marx, but it failed to 
  see one of their important dimensions. While other communists rejected political 
  economy as a justification of capitalism, Marx superseded it. The comprehension 
  of the proletariat presupposes a critique of political economy. The S.I. had 
  much more in common with Moses Hess and Wilhelm Weitling, with Feuerbach and 
  Stirner, the expression of a moment in the emergence of the proletariat. The 
  period which produced them (1830-48) greatly resembles the one in which we live. 
  Putting forward a radical subjectivity against a world of commodity objects 
  and reified relationships, the S.I. expressed an exigency which was fundamental, 
  yet had to be superseded. Becker, a friend of Weitling's, wrote in 1844 : </p>
<p>&quot;We want to live, to enjoy, to understand everything... communism concerns 
  itself with matter only so as to master it and subordinate it to the mind and 
  spirit...&quot; </p>
<p>A large part of current discussions reproduces these pre-1848 debates. Like 
  Invariance today, Feuerbach made humanity into a being which permits the breaking 
  of isolation : </p>
<p>&quot;Isolation signifies a narrow and constricted life, while community, by 
  contrast, signifies an infinite and free one.&quot; </p>
<p>Though he conceptualized the relation between Man and Nature (reproaching Hegel 
  for having neglected it), Feuerbach made the human species into a being over 
  and above social life : &quot;The unity of I and Thou is God.&quot; The 1844 
  Manuscripts gave the senses their place in human activity. By contrast, Feuerbach 
  made sensualism (sic) into the primary problem : </p>
<p>The new philosophy rests on the truth of feelings. In love, and in a more general 
  way, in his feelings, every man affirms the truth of the new philosophy. </p>
<p>The theoretical renaissance around 1968 renewed the old concept within the 
  same limits. Stirner opposed the &quot;will&quot; of the individual to Hess's 
  moralism and Weitling's denunciation of &quot;egoism&quot;, just as the S.I. 
  opposed revolutionary pleasure to militant self-sacrifice. The insistence on 
  subjectivity testifies to the fact that proletarians have not yet succeeded 
  in objectifying a revolutionary practice. When the revolution remains at the 
  stage of desire, it is tempting to make desire into the pivot of the revolution.
