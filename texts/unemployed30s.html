<p class="title">The Unemployed Workers&#8217; Movement</p>
<p class="author">Chapter 2 of &quot;Poor Peoples' Movements: Why They Succeed, 
  How they Fail&quot;<br>by Frances Fox Piven and Richard Cloward</p>

<p >The depression movements of the unemployed and of
industrial workers followed a period of economic breakdown that produced
distress and confusion in the daily lives of millions of people, and produced
contradiction and confusion in the posture of elites. For those still working,
the discontents released by economic collapse during the 1930s were expressed
in struggles within the factory system, which we will turn to in the next chapter.
But the men and women for whom life had changed most drastically and
immediately were no longer in the factories. They were among the masses of the
unemployed, and their struggle had to take another form, in another
institutional context. The depression saw the rise and fall of the largest
movement of the unemployed this country has known, and the institution against
which the movement was inevitably pitted was the relief system.</p>

<p>At the time of the Great Depression, formal arrangements
for relief of the indigent were sparse and fragmented. In many places,
including New York City and Philadelphia, there simply was no “outdoor” relief
(the term used to describe aid given to people who were not institutionalized).
Even where public relief agencies existed, what little was actually given was
usually provided by private charities. But niggardly aid and fragmented
administration did not signify an underdeveloped institution. To the contrary,
a national relief system did exist. Despite the diversity of administrative
auspices, the norms that guided the giving of relief were everywhere quite
similar. The dole was anathema to the American spirit of work and
self-sufficiency. Therefore, it should be dispensed to as few as possible and
made as harsh as possible to discourage reliance upon it. Accordingly, very
little was given, and then only to a handful of the aged and crippled, widowed
and orphaned to “deserving” people who clearly were not able to work.</p>

<p >These practices were not only a reflection of harshly individualistic
American attitudes. They were also a reflection of American economic realities.
Work and self-reliance meant grueling toil at low wages for many people. So
long as that was so, the dole could not be dispensed permissively for fear some
would choose it over work. Thus, most of the poor were simply excluded from
aid, ensuring that they had no alternative but to search for whatever work they
could find at whatever wage was offered. And if they found no work, then they
would have to survive by whatever means they could.</p>

<p >But this much could have been achieved without any relief
arrangements at all; the threat of starvation was sufficient. The more
important function of the relief system was accomplished, not by re fusing
relief, but by degrading and making Outcasts of those few who did get aid. At
the time of the Great Depression the main legal arrangement for the care of the
destitute was incarceration in alms- houses or workhouses. In some places the
care of paupers was still contracted to the lowest bidder, and destitute
orphans were indentured to those who would feed them in exchange for whatever
labor they could perform. The constitutions of fourteen states denied the
franchise to paupers (Brown, 9-10; Woodroofe, 154). By such practices the
relief system created a clearly demarcated and degraded class, a class of
pariahs whose numbers were small but whose fate loomed large in the lives of
those who lived close to indigence, warning them always of a life even worse
than hard work and severe poverty.</p>

<p >The meaning of these relief practices was thus not only in
their inhumanity but in the functions they performed in legitimating work in
the face of the extreme inequalities generated by American capitalism. For many
people work was hard and the rewards few, and the constraints of tradition weak
in the face of the transformations wrought by industrial capitalism. The
discontent these poor might have felt was muffled, in part, by the relief
system and the image of the terrible humiliation inflicted on those who became
paupers. The practices called charity were shaped, in short, by economic
imperatives, by the need for cheap and docile labor on the farms and in the
factories of a burgeoning capitalist society. For the practices of relief to
change, this subordination of the institution of charity to the institution of
profit had to be ruptured.</p>

<p >The wonder of this relief system, however, was that it
generated such shame and fear as to lead the poor to acquiesce in its harsh and
restrictive practices. In part the poor acquiesced simply because they shared
American beliefs in the virtue of work and self sufficiency and in the
possibility of work and self-sufficiency for those who were ambitious and
deserving. But any doubts they might otherwise have felt about this judicious
sorting out of the worthy by the American marketplace were dispelled by the
spectacle of the degraded pauper displayed by the relief system. Even when
unemployment was endemic, most people endured in silence, blaming themselves
for their misfortunes. They did not demand relief, for to do so was to give up
the struggle to remain above the despised pauper class. Most of the time, the
unemployed poor obeyed the prohibition against going on the dole, and by doing
so collaborated in their own misery and in the punitive practices of local
relief officials.</p>

<p >Occasionally, however, unemployment reached calamitous
levels and the jobless rebelled. At the depths of each of the recurrent
depressions of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, people joined
together and demanded some form of aid to ease their distress. In the slump of
1837 some 20,000 unemployed in Philadelphia assembled to demand, among other
things, that the national government relieve distress among the unemployed by a
public works program (Foner, 162), and in New York City, a crowd of thousands
in City Hall Park protested against the “monopolies” and the high cost of food
and rent. The crowd then paraded to the wholesale flour depot, and dumped flour
and wheat in the streets (Gutman, 1976, 60-61). In the panic of 1857 protests
of the un employed emerged in several big cities. Ten thousand Philadelphians
rallied “to stimulate their representatives in the State House to an
appreciation of their troubles,” and a system of ward associations was set up
to issue food to the needy (Feder, 32). In New York a meeting of 15,000 in
Tompkins Square to demand work culminated in the destruction of fences and
benches and the seizure of food wagons, although in this instance the workers
got neither jobs nor relief, and federal troops were called in (Feder, 35). The
depression of 1873 stimulated new demonstrations. In New York City, rallies
drew 10,000 to 15,000 people who were dispersed by mounted police, and in
Chicago, mass meetings of the unemployed, organized by anarchists under the
slogan “Bread or Blood,” culminated in a march of 20,000 on the City Council
(Feder, 52; Boyer and Morais, 86). Subsequently, unemployed workers stormed the
offices of the Chicago Relief and Aid Society, swamping the Society with
applications for aid. The Society surrendered, and about 10,000 were given
relief over the next year (Feder, 52; Seymour, August 1937, 8).<a

class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[1]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
In the depression of 1884 the unemployed in Chicago marched again, this time
into better-off neighborhoods (Montgomery, 20), and in 1893 a new and bitter
depression led to a series of marches on Washington by the unemployed, the best
known of which was of course “Coxey’s army.” Coxey’s marchers got nothing, but
mass demonstrations in the big industrial cities did succeed at least in
getting soup kitchens and, in some places, local public works projects as well.</p>

<p >These experiences suggest that when unemployment is severe
and widespread, at least a partial transvaluation may occur among the poor. The
prohibition against the dole may weaken, if only because the extent of distress
belies the customary conviction that one’s economic fortunes and misfortunes
are a matter of personal responsibility, of individual failure. At such times
large numbers of the poor demand relief, the relief of work or the relief of
food and money. This transvaluation occurred again in the Great Depression, and
just as the scale of the calamity in the 1930s was unparalleled, so too was the
protest movement that arose among the unemployed.</p>

<p class="subtitle">The Great Depression: Preconditions for Insurgency</p>

<p >The depression came suddenly, at a time when the American
belief in unprecedented and unbroken prosperity had never been so fervent,
earlier depressions notwithstanding. People were taken by surprise, the rulers as
much as the ruled and it took time for the political forces set in motion by
the calamity to emerge. Then, as the depression continued and worsened, the
harshening and disordering of a way of life began to take form in rising
popular discontent. The actions of elites added momentum to this process, for
they too were shaken and divided, and their cacophonic accusations and
proposals heightened the sense of indignation that was spreading. In the period
of general political uncertainty that ensued, protest movements emerged among
different groups, focusing on different institutional grievances. The earliest
uprisings occurred among the unemployed.</p>

<p class="subtitle">THE ECONOMIC COLLAPSE</p>

<p >The decade preceding the depression had been a boom time
for American business. National income rose from about $60 billion in 1922 to
$87 billion in 1929, and by June of 1929 the index of industrial production
reached its highest point ever (Bernstein, 1970, 54, 251). For the nation as a
whole prosperity had never seemed so assured.</p>

<p >These were not nearly such good years for many workers and
farmers, however. Rising productivity and profits in the twenties were largely
the result of increasing mechanization rather than the expansion of the labor
force. Meanwhile depressed farm prices (the result of overproduction stimulated
by heavy immigration earlier in the century, followed by the demand for food
during World War I when the United States was feeding its allies) were forcing
millions of people off the land and to the cities. The resulting labor surplus
meant that for the first time in the American experience, prosperity was
accompanied by continuing high unemployment throughout the decade (Lescohier
and Brandeis, 137-151). The labor surplus also accounts for the fact that wages
remained relatively fixed, while profits soared. Moreover, some industries,
particularly mining and textiles were in a slump throughout the decade, and
these workers suffered sharp wage cuts. But the hardships of particular groups
remained submerged, because the people who bore them were subdued by the aura
of prosperity that symbolized the era. These were self-evidently good times in
America; anyone who really wanted to work could ostensibly earn a livelihood.</p>

<p >Then, in 1929, the production index began to slip from its
June high, and by October, after a dizzying burst of speculation, the stock
market reacted in the panic known as Black Thursday. The impact on unemployment
was immediate. One government official judged that the numbers out of work rose
by 2.5 million within two weeks of the crash, and President Roosevelt’s
Committee on Economic Security later estimated that the number of unemployed
jumped from 429,000 in October 1929 to 4,065,000 in January 1930 (Bern. stein,
1970, 254). The number rose steadily to 8 million in January 1931, and to 9
million in October (Bernstein, 1970, 254-257).</p>

<p >Particular industries were devastated, as were the towns
where they were located. Bernstein reports, for example, that by January 1930,
30 to 40 percent of the male labor force was out of work in Toledo, where
Willys-Overland had cut its payroll from 20,000 to 4,000. In Detroit a personal
loan company discovered in March that half its outstanding commitments were
from people who bad lost their jobs. By the end of that year almost half of New</p>

<p >England’s textile workers were unemployed, and the
Metropolitan Life Insurance Company reported that 24 percent of its industrial
policy holders in forty-six larger cities were jobless. The Ford Motor Company
employed 130,000 workers in the spring of 1929; by the summer of 1931 there
were only 37,000 left on the payroll (Bern stein, 1970, 255-256). Sidney Hillman
reported that at the height of the season in January 1932 only 10 percent of
his New York garment workers were employed (Bernstein, 1970, 317). The chronic
unemployment of the 1920s had become catastrophic unemployment.</p>

<p >Most of the nation’s public figures were stubbornly
unwilling to recognize the disaster, at least at first. The White House issued
messages of reassurance that “the fundamental strength of the Nation’s economic
life is unimpaired,” that recovery is “just around the corner,” and that in any
case the temporary downturn was being stemmed by modest public works
expenditures. Official refusal to recognize the disaster early in the depression
also took form in White House denials that there was very much unemployment at
all. If the 1930 census of unemployment did not support such contentions,
Hoover argued that it was because the enumerators “had to list the shiftless
citizen, who had no intention of living by work, as unemployed” (cited in
Edelman, 184).<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn2' href="#_edn2" name="_ednref2"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[2]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
If there was not very much unemployment, it followed that there was not very
much need for unusual measures to aid the unemployed. Hoover limited himself
mainly to offering rhetorical encouragement of local charity efforts. In
October 1930 he established an Emergency Committee for Employment, but ignored
the recommendation of Colonel Arthur woods, head of the committee, that the
White House seek substantial appropriations from Congress for public works. A
second committee, appointed in August 1931, was called the Organization on
Employment Relief. But while its name revealed some dim acknowledgment of the
problem, its activities, consisting of “coordinating” local efforts and
exhorting American citizens to contribute to local charities, did not.</p>

<p >Nor, at first, were local officials much better attuned to
the scale of the problem. City leaders in Buffalo, Cincinnati, Kansas City,
Milwaukee, and Louisville initiated “make a job” or “man a block” campaigns,
assigning the jobless to do snow removal or street cleaning while at the same
time allowing them to canvass households for small donations. Philadelphia’s
mayor appointed a committee to organize the peddling of fruit (Colcord, 166),
clubs and restaurants in some places began to participate in schemes for saving
food leftovers for the unemployed, and some communities set aside plots of land
so that the jobless could grow vegetables to ease their plight. The problem was
defined as minor, and temporary, and so were the gestures made to deal with it.
Until 1932 even the newspapers carried little news of the depression.
Middletown newspapers made their first mention in April 1930 under the caption
“Factories are Recovering from Bad Slump” (Lynd and Lynd, 17).</p>

<p >As the depression worsened in 1930 there were stirrings in
Congress for federal action to alleviate unemployment by reviving and expanding
the United States Employment Service and by expanding federal public works
projects. The measures proposed were modest and the Congress elected in the
fall of 1930 passed both bills. Hoover, ever staunch, vetoed the first and
emasculated the second by appoint-administrators hostile to federal public
works. Nothing had been one to deal with the disaster except, perhaps, to begin
to acknowledge it.</p>

<p class="subtitle">THE IMPACT ON DAILY LIFE</p>

<p >The habit of work, and the wages of work, underpins a way
of life. As unemployment continued to grow, and the wages of those still employed
shriveled, that way of life crumbled. Despite denials by the public figures of
the nation, the evidence was there in the daily lives of the people. One
dramatic sign was the spread of malnutrition and disease. Surveys of school
children showed that one quarter suffered from malnutrition, new patients in tuberculosis
clinics almost doubled, and a study by the U. S. Public Health Service revealed
that the families of unemployed workers suffered 66 percent more illness than
the families of employed workers. In 1931 New York City hospitals reported
about one hundred cases of actual starvation (Bernstein, 1970, 331). Another
sign was the weakening of family life as ties wore thin under the strains and
humiliations of poverty. Desertions became common and divorce rates rose, while
marriage rates and the birthrate dropped.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn3'
href="#_edn3" name="_ednref3" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[3]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
And as poverty deepened and morale weakened, the crime rate rose, as did
drunkenness and sexual promiscuity, and the suicide rate (Bernstein, 1970,
332).</p>

<p >Without work, and with family life weakened, men and
women, especially the young, took to the road. At first the movement was back
to the farms. But soon farm income fell precipitously as well, and then there
was no place to go except to move on, shunted from town to town. Just how many
transients there were, is not known, but the Southern Pacific Railroad reported
that it had ejected 683,457 people from its trains in 1932 (Bernstein, 1970,
325). Everywhere shanty towns built of packing cases and junk sprang up. In
Oklahoma City the vagrants lived in the river bottom; in Oakland, they lived in
sewer pipes that a manufacturer could not sell; in New York they built shacks
in the bed of an abandoned reservoir in Central Park and called it “Hoover
Valley.”</p>

<p class="subtitle">The Rise of Protest</p>

<p >Most of the people who were thrown out of work suffered
quietly, especially at the start of the depression, when official denials
helped to confuse the unemployed and to make them ashamed of their plight. Men
and women haunted the employment offices, walked the streets, lined up for
every job opening, and doubted themselves for not finding work. Families
exhausted their savings, borrowed from relatives, sold their belongings,
blaming themselves and each other for losing the struggle to remain
self-reliant. But as the depression worsened, as the work forces of entire
factories were laid off, as whole neighborhoods in industrial towns were
devastated, and as at least some political leaders began to acknowledge that a
disaster had occurred, attitudes toward what had happened and why, and who was
to blame, began to change among some of the unemployed. They began to define
their personal hardship not just as their own individual misfortune but as
misfortune they shared with many of their own kind. And if so many people were
in the same trouble, then maybe it wasn’t they who were to blame, but “the
system.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn4' href="#_edn4" name="_ednref4" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[4]<![endif]></span></span></span></a></p>

<p class="subtitle">MOB LOOTING, MARCHES, AND DEMONSTRATIONS</p>

<p >One of the earliest expressions of unrest among the
unemployed was the rise of mob looting. As had happened so often before in
history during periods of economic crisis, people banded together to demand
food. By and large, the press refrained from reporting these events for fear of
creating a contagion effect. In New York bands of thirty or forty men regularly
descended upon markets, but the chain stores refused to call the police, in
order to keep the events out of the papers. In March 1,100 men waiting on a
Salvation Army bread line in New York City mobbed two trucks delivering baked
goods to a nearby hotel. In Henryetta, Oklahoma, 300 jobless marched on
storekeepers to demand food, insisting they were not begging and threatening to
use force if necessary (Bernstein, 1970, 422; Brecher, 144). Indeed, Bernstein
concludes that in the early years of the depression “organized looting of food
was a nation-wide phenomenon” (1970, 421—423). </p>

<p >More consciously political demonstrations began as well. By early 1980, unemployed 
  men and women in New York, Detroit, Cleveland, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Chicago, 
  Seattle, Boston, and Milwaukee were marching under such Communist banners as 
  “Work or Wages” and “Fight-Don’t Starve” (Karsh and Garman, 87; Leab, 800). 
  Len de Caux, a labor journalist, was living in Cleveland at the time and described 
  what was happening there: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>“Marching columns of unemployed became a familiar sight. Public Square 
    saw demonstrations running into tens of thousands. The street-scene is etched 
    in memory. It was in the heart of working- class Cleveland, during a communist-led 
    demonstration. Police had attacked an earlier demonstration. In the Street 
    battle, several unemployed had been injured, and one had since died. In the 
    same neighborhood, the Unemployed Councils had called a mass protest, a solemn 
    occasion that brought out thousands. The authorities, under criticism and 
    on the defensive, withdrew every cop from the area, many blocks wide. . . 
    (163-164)”<o:p></o:p></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p >The crowds did not always stay in their own neighborhoods,
and the authorities were not always judicious. On February 11, 1930, for
example, some 2,000 unemployed workers stormed the Cleveland City Hall,
dispersing only when the police threatened to turn fire hoses on them. A few
days later the unemployed demonstrated at City Hall in Philadelphia, and had to
be driven off by the police. A week later mounted police with nightsticks
dispersed a crowd of 1,200 jobless men and women in Chicago. On February 26 a
crowd of 3,000 was broken up by tear gas before the Los Angeles City Hall
(Bernstein, 1970, 426-427).</p>

<p >In March the demonstrations became a national event. The
Communists declared March 6, 1930, International Unemployment Day, and rallies
and marches took place in most major cities. Many of the demonstrations were
orderly, as in San Francisco where the chief of police joined the 2,000
marchers and the mayor addressed them, or in Chicago where some 4,000 people
marched down Halsted and Lake Streets, and then dispatched a committee to
petition the mayor (Lasswell and Blumenstock, 196). But in other places,
including Washington, D.C., and Seattle, local officials grew alarmed and
ordered the police to disperse the crowds with tear gas. In Detroit, CleveLand,
Milwaukee, and Boston, the crowds resisted, and fierce battles broke out
between the demonstrators and the police (Keeran, 2-73; Leab, 306-307).<a

class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[5]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
The worst clash occurred in New York City,<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn6'
href="#_edn6" name="_ednref6" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[6]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
an event which was reported by the <i>New York Times</i><span style='font-style:
normal'>:</span></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>The unemployment demonstration staged by the Communist Party in Union 
    Square broke up in the worst riot New York has seen in recent years when 35,000 
    people attending the demonstration were transformed in a few moments from 
    an orderly, and at times a bored, crowd into a fighting mob. The outbreak 
    came after communist leaders, defying warnings and orders of the police, exhorted 
    their followers to march on City Hall and demand a hearing from Mayor Walker. 
    Hundreds of policemen and detectives, swinging night sticks, blackjacks and 
    bare fists, rushed into the crowd, hitting out at all with whom they came 
    into contact, chasing many across the street and into adjacent thoroughfares 
    and rushing hundreds off their feet. . . . From all parts of the scene of 
    battle came the screams of women and cries of men, with bloody heads and faces. 
    A score of men were sprawled over the square with policemen pummeling them. 
    The pounding continued as the men, and some women, sought refuge in flight.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p >The demonstration was sufficiently threatening to prod the
mayor to agree to form a committee to collect funds to be distributed to the
unemployed.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn7' href="#_edn7" name="_ednref7" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[7]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
In October 1930 the unemployed gathered again in a mass rally at City Hall
plaza to demand that the Board of Estimate appropriate twenty-five dollars a
week for each unemployed person. The police again attacked the demonstrators,
and two of the organizers were injured, but the Board of Estimate appropriated
one million dollars for relief (Naison, 72-73). </p>

<p >The demonstrations were branded as riots by the press; it
was the Communist and Socialist organizers who misnamed them unemployment
demonstrations, said the New York Times (October 17, 1930, 1). But the
unemployed came, whatever the labels of the leaders, and despite the
castigation of the press. Len de Caux suggests why:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>“The communists brought misery out of hiding in the workers’ neighborhoods. 
    They paraded it with angry demands. . . . In hundreds of jobless meetings, 
    I heard no objections to the points the communists made, and much applause 
    for them. Sometimes, I’d hear a communist speaker say something so bitter 
    and extreme, I’d feel embarrassed. Then I’d look around at the unemployed 
    audience; shabby clothes, expressions worried and sour. Faces would start 
    to glow, heads to nod, and hands to clap (162—163).” <o:p></o:p></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p >For some people at least, distress was turning to
indignation, indignation strong enough to withstand official scorn or state
force.</p>

<p >Communist agitators were helping in that transformation,
but the unemployed were ready to respond to any leader who articulated their
grievances. When Father James R. Cox, a Pittsburgh priest known as the Mayor of
Shantytown, called a rally at Pitt Stadium to protest unemployment and demand
public works and relief measures, some 60,000 people turned out, and 12,000
followed him on to Washington where he presented their demands to Hoover
(Bernstein, 1970, 432).<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn8' href="#_edn8"
name="_ednref8" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[8]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
And later, in the spring of 1932, thousands of unemployed veterans and their
families descended on Washington, D.C. Their songs expressed their disaffection:
<i>Mellon pulled the whistle, Hoover rang the bell, Wall Street gave the signal
And the country went to Hell</i></p>

<p >The veterans had in fact not come in a revolutionary or
even in a very belligerent spirit. They had come only to plead with the
Congress for early payment of pensions due them by law in 1945. The Congress
turned them down, Hoover refused to meet with their leaders, and when they
still did not leave, he sent the Army to rout them. “What a pitiable
spectacle,” said the Washington News, “is that of the great American
Government, mightiest in the world, chasing men, women and children with Army
tanks. . . . If the Army must be called out to make war on unarmed citizens,
this is no longer America” (Schlesinger, 1957, 265).</p>

<p class="subtitle">RENT RIOTS</p>

<p >The rising anger among the unemployed took other forms
than street marches and riots. Jobless men and women began to defy the local
authorities and the rules upheld by these authorities associated with specific
hardships. One such kind of defiance was mass resistance to evictions. As
unemployment rose, large numbers of families in many places could not pay their
rents, and the number of evictions increased daily.<a style='mso-endnote-id:

style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[9]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
In 1930 and 1931 small bands of people, often led by Communists, began to use
strong-arm tactics to prevent marshals from putting furniture on the street.
Sometimes they were successful. Even when they were not, physical resistance
was the only resort for people forced from their homes. The rent riots began on

but quickly spread to other parts of the city. The New York Times described an
eviction of three families in the Bronx on February 2, 1932:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>“Probably because of the cold, the crowd numbered only 1,000 although 
    in unruliness it equaled the throng of 4,000 that stormed the police in the 
    first disorder of a similar nature on January 22. On Thursday a dozen more 
    families are to be evicted unless they pay back rents. Inspector Joseph Leonary 
    deployed a force of fifty detectives and mounted and foot patrolmen through 
    the street as Marshal Novick led ten furniture movers into the building. . 
    . . Women shrieked from the windows, the different sections of the crowd hissed 
    and booed and shouted invectives. Fighting began simultaneously in the house 
    and the street. The marshal’s men were rushed on the stairs and got to work 
    after the policemen had driven the tenants back into their apartments.”<o:p></o:p></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p >Boyer and Morais claim that such tactics succeeded in
restoring 77,000 evicted families to their homes in New York City (261).</p>

<p >Chicago was also the scene of frequent “rent riots,”
especially in the black neighborhoods where unemployment reached catastrophic
proportions and evictions were frequent. In the brief period from August 11 to
October 31, 1931 there were 2,185 cases before Renter’s Court, 38 percent of
which involved blacks (Gosnell, 1967, 321—329). Small groups known as “black
bugs” marched through the streets to mobilize large crowds to reinstall evicted
families, sometimes even when the family was not present.<a style='mso-endnote-id:

that these actions of necessity were virtually spontaneous:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>“During the last part of 1950 the Unemployed Councils had established 
    headquarters in many of the poorer sections of the city. The meeting-halls 
    served as clubhouses where jobless men tired of tramping the streets in search 
    of work came to rest and talk rather than face the trying tensions of the 
    home. These men, establishing mutual relations of identification on the basis 
    of their common misfortune, began to act together to prevent evictions. The 
    demonstrations were entirely unplanned and could not be throttled at the source 
    because the men themselves never knew in advance when or where they would 
    next demonstrate. Someone might come into the hall and tell of a person blocks 
    away who was at that moment being evicted. Their indignation aroused, the 
    men would march in a group down the street, adding the sympathetic and the 
    curious to their number as they marched, until by the time they reached the 
    scene of the eviction, the crowd would have grown in size and temper. The 
    furniture of the unfortunate family would be replaced and the crowd, delighted 
    with its success, would disperse gradually, in small groups (Lasswell and 
    Blumenstock, 170— 171).”<o:p></o:p></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p >Horace Cayton describes a Chicago rent riot in which he
participated. One day in 1931 Cayton was sitting in a restaurant on the South
Side and saw through the window a long file of black people, marching in deadly
earnest. He joined them and later described what happened:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>“We were met at the street by two squad cars of police who asked us where 
    we were going. The black crowd swarmed around the officers. . . . No one moved. 
    Everyone simply stood and stared at them. One officer lost his head and drew 
    his gun, leveling it at the crowd. . . . No threats, no murmurs, no disorder; 
    the crowd just looked at him. There the officer stood. Just then a siren was 
    heard-the whisper went around-the riot squad was coming...four cars full of 
    blue-coated officers and a patrol wagon. They jumped out before the cars came 
    to a stop and charged down upon the crowd. Night sticks and “billies” played 
    a tattoo on black heads. “Hold your places!” shouted the woman. “Act like 
    men!” answered the crowd. They stood like dumb beasts—no one ran, no one fought 
    or offered resistance, just stood, an immovable black mass.”<o:p></o:p></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p >These tactics frequently culminated in beatings, arrests,
and even killings,<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn13' href="#_edn13"

but they also forced relief officials to give out money for rent payments
(Seymour, December 1937, 14). A rent riot in August 1931 left three people dead
and three policemen injured: “News of the riot screamed in the headlines of the
evening press. The realization of the extent of unrest in the Negro district
threw Chicago into panic” (Lasswell and Blumenstock, 197). Mayor Anton Cermak responded
by promptly ordering a moratorium on evictions, and some of the rioters got
work relief.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn14' href="#_edn14" name="_ednref14"

<p >Karsh and Garman report that in many places the Communists
organized gas squads to turn the gas back on in people’s houses and electric
squads to string wires around the meter after it was shut off by the local
utility (88). In Detroit, it took one hundred police men to evict a resisting
family, and later two Detroit families who protected their premises by shooting
the landlord were acquitted by Sympathetic juries (Bernstein, 1970, 428).</p>

<p class="subtitle">RELIEF INSURGENCY</p>

<p >There is surely reason to think that it is easier for
people to defend their homes against the authorities than to demand relief,
simply because Americans are more likely to believe they have a right to their
homes than to believe they have a right to handouts, no matter how overwhelming
the economic disaster that confronts them. Most of the unemployed resisted the
final degradation of asking for relief for as long as they could. A study of
those who applied for aid in 1932 in San Francisco and Alameda counties, for
example, reported:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>Nearly two-thirds did not apply for relief until at least a year had elapsed 
    after the chief breadwinner had lost his regular employment, and nearly one-third 
    of these families had managed to get along for two years or longer. . .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; 
    </span>By the time they applied for relief, many of these families were in 
    debt to the grocer and the landlord; they had used their pitifully small savings; 
    they had borrowed sums which though small, could probably never be repaid. 
    Finally, they were defeated in their valiant struggle to maintain their independence 
    . . . (Huntington, 66, 74).</i><a style='mso-endnote-id:edn15' href="#_edn15"

</blockquote>
<p >For many, sheer desperation finally forced violation of
the prohibition against the dole. For others, it was more than desperation; it
was anger. Some people came to believe that if there were no jobs if the
factories and offices and workshops turned them away, then they had a right to
the income they needed to survive anyway. Fired by this new indignation, crowds
of jobless men and women descended on relief offices, cornered and harassed
administrators, and even took over the offices until their demands were met,
until money or goods were distributed to them.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn16'
href="#_edn16" name="_ednref16" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[16]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
Lasswell and Blumenstock describe these early relief actions in Chicago:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>“Hearing that some family had been refused relief or that some particularly 
    needy case was being denied immediate attention, groups would gather and march 
    on the relief stations, demanding action. Social workers in many of the offices, 
    having intimate knowledge of the misery behind such demands, hesitated to 
    call the police. - . . Hence at first the relief offices met the demands of 
    the demonstrators, giving Mrs. Jones the food basket which she should have 
    had a week earlier. With success, demonstrations of this sort increased in 
    number and size. The relief stations found themselves unable to deal with 
    this type of mass pressure. For example, on the afternoon of August 31, 1931, 
    a group of 400 persons began to march on the United Charities offices located 
    at 4500 Prairie Avenue. By the time they reached the relief station, the number 
    had grown to fifteen or sixteen hundred. A speaker addressed them in front 
    of the station, and the tension grew so high that when Joel Hunter, Chief 
    Administrator of the Charities, asked for the selection of a committee to 
    present the grievances of the crowd, there was a move to storm the station. 
    A police squad arrived, and a general riot ensued (171).”<o:p></o:p></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p >A study published by the American Public Welfare
Association later in 1937 described similar demonstrations across the nation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>“Relief offices were approached by large committees, numbering ten, fifteen, 
    twenty, and sometimes more persons, which demanded immediate audience, without 
    previous appointment and regardless of staff members’ schedules. . . - Frequently 
    these large committees were buttressed by neighborhood crowds which gathered 
    outside the relief office and waited while committees within presented “demands” 
    (Seymour, December 1937, 15).”<o:p></o:p></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p >Relief officials, who were accustomed to discretionary
giving to a meek clientele and were not much governed by any fixed set of
regulations, usually acquiesced in the face of aggressive protests. With each
abrasive encounter, officials in local and private charities gradually forfeited
the discretion to give or withhold aid. Mark Naison reports some of the
incidents: “I stood in the rain for three days and the Home Relief Bureau paid
no attention to me,” a woman declared at a neighborhood meeting in New York
City. “Then I found Out about the Unemployed Council…We went in there as a body
and they came across right quick.” “The woman at the desk said I was rejected,”
another woman added. “I was crying when Comrade Minns told me to come to the
meeting of the Unemployed Council. One week later I got my rent check” (l52).<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn17' href="#_edn17" name="_ednref17" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[17]<![endif]></span></span></span></a></p>

<p >As the unemployed became more disruptive, even cherished
procedures of investigation and surveillance of recipients were relinquished. A
news sheet put out by an unemployed group in Port Angeles, Washington,
exemplified the new spirit:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>“Home Visitors” or “snoopers” are only relief workers on a cash basis. 
    They are picked for their ability as snoopers and stool pigeons only. They 
    ask you so damn many questions that there is nothing personal left to you 
    anyway (cited in Seymour, December 1937, 15).”<o:p></o:p></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p >As indignation mounted, in other words, some people not
only defied the prohibition against going on the dole, but some even began to
defy the apparatus of ritualized humiliation that had made that prohibition so
effective. And as they did, the movement gathered momentum.</p>

<p >Naison describes the unemployed movement in Harlem (where
unemployment affected 80 percent of heads of household) during this period:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>“To force the relief system to function more effectively, the unemployed 
    movement settled on a strategy of stimulating disorder. Harlem Council activists 
    organized large groups of jobless workers, took them to the local relief station, 
    and demanded that they receive aid. If the relief bureau officials refused 
    to see them or claimed they were out of aid, the demonstrators camped in the 
    bureau offices and remained there until they received aid or were removed 
    by the police. If police tried to remove the demonstrators or prevent them 
    from entering the bureaus, Council tactics became more violent. At one demonstration 
    in late June of 1932, the Amsterdam News reported a group from the Harlem 
    Council broke down the bureau’s doors and “overturned desks and chairs” before 
    the police could arrest them. Other demonstrations ended in pitched battles 
    between police and Council activists that resulted in bloodied heads and numerous 
    arrests (137).”<o:p></o:p></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p >In Chicago, “spontaneous outbreaks grew in size and
frequency, and through them the accumulated tensions and effects resulting from
economic deprivation and from newspaper neglect or criticism and police
repression became ‘collectivized.” The number of demonstrations increased, from
408 in 1931 to 566 in 1932 (Lasswell and Blumenstock, 172-173). The
demonstrations were also becoming more massive and well-organized. On January
1l, 1932, simultaneous demonstrations were held at all the relief stations of
Chicago.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn18' href="#_edn18" name="_ednref18" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[18]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
Later that year, some 5,000 men who had been forced to take refuge in municipal
lodging houses marched on relief headquarters to demand three meals a day, free
medical attention, tobacco twice a week, the right to hold Council meetings in
the lodging houses, and the assurance of no discrimination against Unemployed
Council members. Their demands were granted. Later in 1932, when relief funds
were cut 50 percent by a financially strangled city administration, some 25,000
of the unemployed marched again, this time through the Chicago Loop in a cold,
driving rain. The authorities quickly managed to borrow funds from the
Reconstruction Finance Corporation, and the cut was rescinded.</p>

<p >In Detroit hundreds of people organized by the Unemployed
Councils gathered at City Hall in August 1931 to demand better food and better
treatment from the police at the municipal lodging houses. Just a few months
later, the Young Communist League led a march of several thousand on one of the
Briggs auto plants to demand jobs and unemployment insurance (Keeran, 77). Then
in March 1932, after the severe winter, unemployed workers in Detroit who had
been assembled by Communist organizers to march on the Ford River Rouge plant
were fired on by Dearborn police. Four of the marchers were killed, many more
were wounded. The press was divided: the Detroit Mirror savagely attacked the
“riotous” marchers, but the Detroit Times accused the police of having “changed
an orderly demonstration into a riot with death and blood shed as its toll”
(Keeran, 82-83; Prickett, 119). Two days later, some sixty thousand Detroit
workers marched behind the coffins to the tune of the <i>Internationale</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>.</span></p>

<p >In Atlanta in June 1932 city and county authorities
decided to drop 23,000 families from the relief rolls, claiming there were no
funds. To maintain a degree of order in the face of this decision, local
authorities proceeded to arrest hundreds of farm workers (who had come to
Atlanta in search of work) on charges of vagrancy, in order to send them back
to the countryside. But when a thousand of the unemployed rallied at the
courthouse, the order to cut the families was rescinded, and additional money
was appropriated for relief (Herndon, 188-192).<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn19'
href="#_edn19" name="_ednref19" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[19]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
In St. Louis 3,000 of the jobless marched and forced the passage at City Hall
of two relief bills (Boyer and Morais, 263). Each such protest that succeeded
in getting people money added morale and momentum to the movement, and further
undermined the doctrine that being “on the county” was a confession of personal
failure, a badge of shame.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Local Fiscal Breakdown</p>

<p >The number of jobless continued to rise. In the big
industrial cities, where unemployment was especially severe, the unemployed
some times comprised voting majorities. Faced with mounting protests, local
officials could not remain indifferent. Clearly the private agencies which had
in many places handled whatever relief was given could not meet the surging demand,
and various ad hoc arrangements were quickly invented, often with the
cooperation of local businessmen and philanthropists. Committees were set up,
local citizens were exhorted to contribute to charity drives, and in some
places city employees found their wages reduced for contributions to the relief
fund. By these methods, expenditures for relief rose from $71 million in 1929
to $171 million in 1931 (Chandler, 192).</p>

<p >But this amount of relief in cities like New York,
Chicago, Detroit, and Philadelphia barely scratched the surface of the need.
The city manager of Cincinnati reported on the relief methods used there at the
end of 1931, when about one-quarter of the city’s workers were unemployed, and
another quarter worked only part-time:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>“Relief is given to a family one week and then they are pushed off for 
    a week in the hope that somehow or other the breadwinner may find some kind 
    of work. . . . We are paying no rent at all. That, of course, is a very difficult 
    problem because we are continually having evictions, and social workers . 
    . . are hard put to find places for people whose furniture has been put out 
    on the streets (quoted in Chandler, 43).”<o:p></o:p></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p >In New York City, where the charter of 1898 prohibited
“outdoor” relief as distinct from relief in workhouses or poor houses,
disruptions by the unemployed had led to the creation of an arrangement whereby
the police precincts distributed direct relief to the most destitute from funds
contributed by city employees. In 1931, on Governor Roosevelt’s initiative, New
York State established an emergency program which supplemented local relief
funds with an initial outlay of $20 million. Even so, by 1932, the lucky among
the unemployed in New York City were receiving an average grant of $2.39 per
week, and only one-quarter were getting that (Schlesinger, 1957, 253).
Testimony before the Senate Committee on Manufactures in the summer of 1932
reported that 20,000 children in New York had been placed in institutions
because parents could not provide for them.</p>

<p >In Chicago in October 1931 40 percent of the work force
was unemployed, but help was being given only to the completely destitute. A
local official reported:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>“In the city of Chicago there are 1,000 men eating in the breadlines food 
    that costs &frac12; cents a day, and these men are from the so-called Gold 
    Coast of Chicago. These resources are about to end, and they are confronted 
    with one meal a day within, say 30 days after the city funds will become exhausted 
    (quoted in Chandler, 45).”<o:p></o:p></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p >Since Chicago was a railway hub, officials also had to
deal with large numbers of transients, some of whom lived in a shanty town at
the foot of Randolph Street, scavenging garbage for a living. Others were
crowded in asylums and poor houses. Bernstein reports that the Oak Forest poor
house, having filled’ its corridors, turned away 19,000 people in 1931 (1970,
297-298). By June 1932, Mayor Cermak told a House committee that if the federal
government didn’t send $150 million for relief immediately, they should be
prepared to send troops later. And Chicago’s leading industrialists and bankers
joined in an appeal to Hoover for federal relief funds (Bernstein, 1970, 467).</p>

<p >In Philadelphia, public relief had been abolished in 1879,<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn20' href="#_edn20" name="_ednref20" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[20]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
and so it fell to a committee of leading philanthropists and businessmen to
deal with the problem. They inaugurated a diversified program of work relief,
shelters, and loans, but their efforts were dwarfed by the need. Some 250,000
were Out of work in Philadelphia. “We have unemployment in every third house,”
the executive director of the Philadelphia Children’s Bureau told the Senate
Subcommittee on Manufactures. “It is almost like the visitation of death to the
house holds of the Egyptians at the time of the escape of the Jews from Egypt”
(Bernstein, 1970, 299—300).</p>

<p >In Detroit, Frank Murphy had won the mayoralty in 1930
with a campaign that pledged aid to the unemployed, and a public relief program
was established with the result that the costs of relief raised from $116,000
in February 1929 to $1,582,000 two years later. But even so, Detroit provided
only $3.60 for two adults per week, and a study in 1931 of those dropped from
the rolls showed that average total income per person was $1.56 a week. Not
surprisingly, Mayor Murphy reversed his belief in local responsibility, and
told the Senate Manufactures Subcommittee that there ought to be federal help.</p>

<p >These cities were actually the more liberal ones. In most
places, people got only a little food: Baltimore, for example, provided an
average weekly relief allotment of eighty cents in commodities (Greenstein). In
Atlanta, white recipients received sixty cents a week, while blacks got less,
when they got anything at all (Herndon, 188). Fortune summed up local relief
efforts in the fall of 1931:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>“The theory was that private charitable organizations and semi public 
    welfare groups . . . were capable of caring for the casualties of a world-wide 
    economic disaster. And the theory in application meant that social agencies 
    manned for the service of a few hundred families, and city shelters set up 
    to house and feed a handful of homeless men, were compelled by the brutal 
    necessities of hunger to care for hundreds of thousands of families and whole 
    armies of the displaced and jobless. . . . The result was the picture now 
    presented in city after city. . . heterogeneous groups of official and unofficial 
    relief agencies struggling under the earnest and untrained leadership of the 
    local men of affairs against an inertia of misery and suffering and want they 
    are powerless to overcome (cited in Bernstein, 1970, 301).”<o:p></o:p></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p >In November 1932 a distinguished group of California
citizens serving on the State Unemployment Commission published a report of its
findings:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>“Unemployment and loss of income have ravaged numerous homes. It has broken 
    the spirits of their members, undermined their health, robbed them of self-respect, 
    and destroyed their efficiency and employability. . . . Many households have 
    been dissolved; little children parceled out to friends, relatives or charitable 
    homes; husbands and wives, parents and children separated, temporarily or 
    permanently. Homes in which life savings were invested and hopes bound up 
    have been lost never to be recovered. Men, young and old, have taken to the 
    road . . . the army of homeless grows alarmingly. . . . Precarious ways of 
    existing, questionable methods of “getting by” rapidly develop (cited in Bernstein, 
    1970, 321).”<o:p></o:p></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p >And in 1932 the New York Evening Graphic ran a series on
starvation cases that year. The depression was no longer being denied.</p>

<p >However pathetic local relief programs were compared to
the scale of the need, the cost of even that puny effort had brought many
cities close to bankruptcy, and other municipal services were taking the brunt
of the fiscal squeeze. A Detroit official reported that essential public
services had been reduced “beyond the minimum point absolutely essential to the
health and safety of the city,” and this despite the fact that municipal
salaries had been sharply Cut. Chicago (whose finances had been in a shambles
even before the depression) owed its school teachers $20 million dollars in
back pay (Hopkins, 92-93). Boston had not paid its police for months (Bird,
108).</p>

<p >With local disturbances increasing, and local finances on
the verge of collapse, other urban states followed New York’s example. New
Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, and Wisconsin provided emergency out lays of relief
funds, and other states began to underwrite municipal borrowing for relief. As
a result of state and local efforts, total expenditures for relief rose by another
$71 million between 1931 and 1932, to reach a total of $317 million. This
amount of relief provided less than $27 that year for each of the 12 million
unemployed. Even so, the effort was taking a heavy toll from local governments;
to meet relief debts in the face of sharply declining tax revenues, spending on
other programs fell by $966 million between 1931 and 1932. Increasingly, local
governments turned to borrowing, but they found fewer purchasers for their
bonds, partly because many municipalities were no longer credit-worthy. On
April 15 Survey magazine published reports from thirty-seven large cities and
concluded that “the industrial cities of the Middle West and the large cities
of Pennsylvania are in desperate plight...Complete breakdown is imminent.”</p>

<p >By early 1933 nearly one thousand local governments had
defaulted on their debts (Chandler, 48-50).</p>

<p >In February 1932, as part of a campaign for his bill to
provide federal loans for unemployment relief, Senator La Follette sent out a
questionnaire to mayors all over the country asking about current numbers of
people on relief, anticipated increases, the amounts of relief aid being given,
whether the city was in a position to float bond issues to meet relief needs,
and whether the mayors favored federal appropriations to “aid in providing more
adequate relief for the needy or in lessening the burden on local taxpayers.”
In their replies, the mayors described widespread distress and clamored for
federal aid. Not only were they administering relief on a starvation basis, but
virtually every municipality claimed to be close to bankruptcy and faced the
prospect of having to cut off relief altogether.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn21'

<p >Unable to resist the political pressures of the
unemployed, local elites had brought their cities to the brink of fiscal
collapse. But even so, city budgets could not handle the demand for relief, and
so the pressure was not abated, but worsened as unemployment rose. Driven by
the protests of the masses of unemployed and the threat of financial ruin,
mayors of the biggest cities of the United States, joined by business and
banking leaders, had become lobbyists for the poor.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Electoral Instability and Federal Response</p>

<p >By November 1932 the political unrest that had spurred
local leaders to try to respond to the unemployed spread upward to produce a
national political disturbance, the electoral upheaval of 1932. In the
avalanche of new legislation that followed, concessions were made to each group
in a volatile constituency. What the unemployed got was federal relief. </p>

<p >The Republican Party had been in power since the toppling
of the Wilson Administration in the election of 1920, when Harding carried
every major non-southern city. With eastern businessmen at the helm, the
Republicans ruled securely thereafter, receiving substantial majorities in each
election until 1930, their strength concentrated particularly in the urban
North. Hoover had won the presidency with a majority of 6.5 million votes.</p>

<p >As for the Democratic Party, after the debacle of 1924
during which the agrarian wing had been defeated, it too had come firmly under
the control of eastern conservatives, businessmen like Bernard Baruch and John
J. Raskob, and machine politicians like Alfred E. Smith. But the depression
created the shifting currents that would bring new leaders to the forefront of
the Democratic Party, and would then force the massive realignment of voters
that brought these leaders to national power. The realignment was first
signaled in the election of 1928 when big city wage earners began to switch to
the Democratic Party and the candidacy of Al Smith.<a style='mso-endnote-id:

class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[22]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
The shift of urban working-class voters became more evident as the depression
worsened; the Republicans suffered reversals in the congressional elections of
1930. But it was the presidential election of 1932 that produced one of the
most sweeping political realignments in American history, and it was the
election of 1936 that confirmed it.</p>

<p >The man who rose to power through these dislocations was,
of course, Franklin Delano Roosevelt; he won the Democratic nomination from a
divided and uncertain Democratic Party on the fourth ballot, and then went on
to campaign by making promises to every one who would listen.<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn23' href="#_edn23" name="_ednref23" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[23]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
What working people listened to were the promises to “build from the bottom up
and not from the top down, that put their faith once more in the forgotten man
at the bottom of the economic pyramid” (Roosevelt, 159-206, 625). Roosevelt won
with a plurality of almost seven million votes, capturing the largest electoral
majority since 1864, and sweeping in art overwhelmingly Democratic Congress.
And much of Roosevelt’s majority was concentrated in the big cities of the
country, where unemployment and hardship were also concentrated. Economic
catastrophe had resulted in a mass rejection of the party in power.</p>

<p >In the interim between the election and Roosevelt’s
inauguration, the index of industrial production sank to its lowest point ever,
and the number of unemployed was increasing at the rate of about 200,000 a
month (Lescohier and Brandeis, 163), to reach at least 12 million by March
1933. The clamor for federal relief was virtually irresistible. A Social
Science Research Council Bulletin characterized the situation this way:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>“By the time the new federal administration came into power in 1933, the 
    pressure for more money had become so nearly unanimous that it was politically 
    desirable for congressmen and senators to favor large appropriations for relief; 
    candidates were elected often on a platform which predicated adequate relief 
    appropriations by Congress (White and White, 84).”<o:p></o:p></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p >In a message to Congress three weeks after the
inauguration, Franklin Delano Roosevelt called for a Civilian Conservation
Corps, a public works program, and a massive program of federal emergency
relief. The Civilian Conservation Corps provided jobs at subsistence wages for
a mere 250,000 men. The Public Works Ad ministration was slow in getting
started, and in any case it was designed not so much to provide jobs for the
unemployed as to stimulate the economy, so that most of the jobs went to
skilled workers. By contrast the Federal Emergency Relief Act, drawn up by
Senators Edward P. Costigan, Robert F. Wagner, and Robert N. La Follette, Jr.,
allocated $500 million for immediate grants to the states for relief of the unemployed,
half of which was to be spent on a matching basis. The act was signed on May
12, Harry Hopkins was sworn in as administrator on May 22 and by the evening of
that day, and he made the first grants to the states. By early June, forty-five
states had received federal grants for relief, and total expenditures on relief
rose to $794 million in 1933, to $1,489 million in 1934, and to $1,834 million
in 1935 (Brown, 204). When the program was terminated in June 1936 the federal
government had spent $3 billion as its share of relief expenditures.<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn24' href="#_edn24" name="_ednref24" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[24]<![endif]></span></span></span></a></p>

<p >It had taken protest and the ensuing fiscal and electoral
disturbances to produce federal relief legislation, and it took continued
protest to get the legislation implemented. By 1934 many people had been
without work a long time—an estimated 6 million for more than a year (Karsh and
Garman, 86). And during 1933, 1934, and 1935, groups of the unemployed continued
to agitate, and were at least partly responsible for the fact that many states
and localities participated in federal emergency relief programs at all. In
August 1933, when state appropriations were needed in Ohio, 7,000 jobless
marched on the state capitol (Rosenzweig, 1975, 58). In Colorado, when the
federal relief funds were discontinued in the winter of 1934 because the state
had repeatedly failed to appropriate its share of costs, mobs of the unemployed
rioted in relief centers, looted food stores, and stormed the state
legislature, driving the frightened senators from the chamber. Two weeks later,
the General Assembly sent a relief bill to the governor, and federal funding
was resumed (Cross). An attempt in Chicago to cut food allowances by 10 percent
in November 1934 led to a large demonstration by the unemployed, and the city
council restored that cut. In the spring of 1935 the federal government
withheld relief after Illinois failed to provide its share of funding. When
relief offices closed down, the unemployed marched and demonstrated in Chicago
and Springfield until the state legislature appropriated funds. Relief was cut
in Kansas City, Kansas, later that year and 2,000 of the unemployed assembled
in front of the courthouse where they remained and prayed and sang hymns until
a new relief appropriation was voted (Gilpin).</p>

<p >These were only the publicized protests. A survey
conducted in New York City revealed that almost all of the forty-two district
relief administrators in New York City reported frequent dealings with
Unemployed groups, most of them led by Communists. These groups were disruptive;
shouting, picketing, refusing to leave the relief offices and the groups
frequently won their demands. Five of the relief offices were observed
continuously over a thirty-day period during which 196 demands by unemployed
groups were recorded, of Which 107 were granted (Brophy and Hallowitz, 63-65).</p>

<p >By the winter of 1934 20 million people were on the dole,
and monthly grant levels had risen from an average of $15.15 per family in May
1933 to an average of $24.53 in May 1934 and to $29.33 in May 1935. Harry
Hopkins explained the new government posture toward the unemployed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>“For a long time those who did not require relief entertained the illusion 
    that those being aided were in need through some fault of their own. It is 
    now pretty clear in the national mind that the unemployed are a cross-section 
    of the workers, the finest people in the land (Kurzman, 85).”<o:p></o:p></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="subtitle">From Disruption to Organization</p>

<p >From the onset of the depression, the potential for unrest
among the unemployed attracted organizers and activists from the left. Their
approaches to work with the unemployed varied. But they all deplored the loose
and chaotic character of the movement, and they all strove to build
organization.</p>

<p >The Communists were first in the field; indeed, they had
been in the field as early as 1921, trying to organize the unemployed into
“Councils of Action,” but without much success. In 1929 they began a new
campaign to form “Unemployed Councils.”<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn25'
href="#_edn25" name="_ednref25" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[25]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
During the winter of 1929-1930, Communist organizers worked vigorously, on the
breadlines, in the flop houses, among the men waiting at factory gates, and in
the relief offices. By mid-1930 the unemployed had become the chief focus of
party activity. The party’s theoretical journal, <i>The Communist</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>, asserted that those out of work were “the tactical
key to the present state of the class struggle” (cited in Rosenzweig, 1 976a).</span></p>

<p >During this early period, Communist activists concentrated
on direct action rather than on organization, and the actions they led in the
streets and in the relief offices were generally more militant and disruptive
than those of other unemployed groups. Communists, many of whom were unemployed
workers,<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn26' href="#_edn26" name="_ednref26" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[26]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
seized upon every grievance as an opportunity for inciting mass actions, and
channeled their formidable self-discipline and energy into the extensive
pamphleteering and agitation that helped bring the unemployed together, and
helped raise the pitch of anger to defiance. Moreover, Communists themselves
often took the lead in confrontations with police; comrades were exhorted to
stand firm and defend other unemployed workers when the police attacked, as
they often did (Seymour, August 1937, 9-11; Leab, 300-303; Lasswell and
Blumenstock, 165-213).</p>

<p >At this stage, there were few membership meetings, little
formal structure within each group, and very little effort to establish formal
linkages among the different groups. The Councils sprang alive at mass meetings
and demonstrations; in between, only a cadre group constituted the
organization. “But because of the temper of the times,” says Leab, “this hard
core managed to bring out ever- increasing numbers of people for the various
protest demonstrations”(304).</p>

<p >Early in the depression most Socialists had been opposed
to organizing the unemployed. Instead, the National Executive Committee of the
Socialist Party had, in May 1929, urged the creation of Emergency Conferences
on Unemployment that would lobby for the Socialist program of old age benefits,
unemployment insurance, and the abolition of child labor. Little came of the
Emergency Conferences, but groups of Socialists in some localities, many of
them associated with the League for Industrial Democracy, began to organize
committees or unions of the unemployed despite the absence of a national
mandate. They used grievance procedures and mass pressure tactics not very
different from the Communist unemployed groups.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn27'
href="#_edn27" name="_ednref27" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[27]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
The most successful of these was the Chicago Workers’ Committee on Unemployment
which was credited with raising Cook County relief payments to one of the
highest in the nation (Rosenzweig, 1974, 12). By February 1932, prodded by the
Success of the Communist Unemployed Councils, and by the local Socialist-led
organizations that had already emerged, the National Executive Committee of the
Socialist Party finally endorsed direct organizing of the unemployed
(Rosenzweig, 1974, 14), with the result that Socialists in other places, most
importantly in New York and Baltimore, began organizing on the model of the
Chicago Workers’ Committee. These groups later initiated the Workers’ Alliance of
America, the culmination of the organizational efforts among the unemployed.</p>

<p >Other radicals were also active, many of them affiliated
with the Conference for Progressive Labor Action formed in May 1929 by
Socialists and trade unionists who were opposed both to the conservative
leadership of the AFL and to the dual union approach of the Communist Trade
Union Unity League. The CPLA began as a propaganda and education organization
but by 1931 it began to move to the left and A. J. Muste, who had run the Brookwood
Labor College in the 1920s, emerged as the leading figure, with a program to
build local organizations of the unemployed. The Muste groups, usually called
Unemployed Leagues, flourished particularly in the rural areas and small towns
of Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, where the
approach taken by the Muste radicals, at least at the beginning, was
non-doctrinaire and oriented toward the immediate needs of the unemployed. The
Seattle Un employment League, a kind of model for many of these efforts
(although it was not actually affiliated with the CPLA), was a particular
success, at least briefly. It claimed 12,000 members in Seattle itself by the
end of 1931 and a statewide membership of 80,000 by the end of 1932. At first the
Seattle group emphasized barter, working for farmers in exchange for produce.
But when the harvest season of 1931 was over, and self-help came to an end, the
league turned to the city for help. The city council, uneasy about the growing
numbers of league supporters, voted an appropriation of half a million dollars
for relief, and turned the fund over to the league to ad minister. During the
spring elections of 1932, when an estimated one-third of Seattle’s voters were
league members, the league sup ported a slate headed by John F. Dore, who
campaigned with talk of taking huge fortunes away “from those who stole them
from the American workers,” and won with the largest plurality in Seattle
history. Once in office, however, Dore took the administration of relief away
from the league and threatened to use machine guns on the unemployed
demonstrations, earning himself the name “Revolving Dore” (Bernstein, 1970,
416-418).</p>

<p >Many of the Unemployed Leagues, like the Seattle League,
did not last long as self-help efforts, if only because self-help programs
could not cope with extensive and lasting unemployment. By 1933 the leagues
became more political and abrasive in outlook and tactics, joining in the
general demand for public relief. Some fell under the leadership of the
Communists, and later some of the leaders of the leagues, Louis Budenz among
them, joined the Communist Party.</p>

<p >Other groups appeared in many towns, sometimes under
auspices which had nothing to do with radical politics. Local politicians, for
example, set up clubs in their wards to handle relief grievances on behalf of
individual constituents, particularly before elections,<a style='mso-endnote-id:
edn28' href="#_edn28" name="_ednref28" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[28]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
and in many rural or partially rural areas, groups organized around self-help
and barter programs.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn29' href="#_edn29"
name="_ednref29" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[29]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
In Dayton, Ralph Borsodi, a utopian thinker who believed in a return to the
land, was engaged by the Council of Social Agencies to organize groups that
undertook to produce their own goods (Bernstein, 1970, 420). Arthur Moyer, the
president of Antioch College, established the Midwest Exchange, Inc., which
encouraged self-help and barter among independent groups (Glick, 13-14). In
Harlem, self-help took the form of food collections and rent parties often
organized by the churches or by the disciples of Father Divine.<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn30' href="#_edn30" name="_ednref30" title=""><span

style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[30]<![endif]></span></span></span></a></p>

<p >In some places, particularly in the coal regions where
unemployment was endemic, trade unions helped and even joined with the
unemployed. Locals of the United Mine Workers led two hunger marches in
Charleston, West Virginia, for example, and joined with the Unemployed Council
in Gallup, New Mexico, in leading mass resistance against evictions of
unemployed miners from homes built on land owned by mining companies. In
Pennsylvania, some locals of the UMW affiliated with and gave financial support
to the unemployed groups (Seymour, December 1937, 6). Elsewhere, unemployed
groups occasionally provided support for striking workers. In the Toledo
Auto-Lite strike and the Milwaukee Streetcar strike in 1934, it was the support
of thousands of the unemployed that finally broke employer resistance. And in
Minneapolis, unemployed workers were included in the militant local 574 of the
Teamsters (Glick, 13). By and large, however, the trade unions avoided the
unemployed, who were dropped from the union membership rolls as their dues lapsed.<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn31' href="#_edn31" name="_ednref31" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[31]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
Subsequently William Green and John L. Lewis sent messages of greetings to
meetings of the unemployed (Seymour, December 1937, 10), but the CIO refused to
permit the request of the organization of the unemployed to affiliate.</p>

<p >Because of the variegated character of the unemployed
movement, membership cannot be accurately estimated, and in any case it
probably fluctuated widely. People were attracted by the chances of getting
relief, and many dropped out once the needed aid was received. Until February
1934 the Unemployed Councils did not have either dues or members; adherents
were simply called sup porters (Seymour, August 1937, 11-13). Still, if any
gauge is pro vided by the groups’ own claims, the numbers were impressive for a
grassroots organization. By 1933 the Ohio Unemployed League claimed a
membership of 100,000 distributed among 187 locals throughout the state; the
Pennsylvania Unemployed League in 1935 claimed 25,000 members in twelve
counties; the Pennsylvania Security League reported some 70,000 members
(Seymour, December 1937); the Pittsburgh Unemployed Citizens’ League claimed
50,000 dues-paying members in fifty locals (Karsh and Garman, 92). In Chicago
the Unemployed Councils alone claimed a membership of 22,000 in forty-five
local branches (Karsh and Garman, 90) while the Socialist-led groups had
organized 25,000 jobless by mid-1932 (Rosenzweig, 1 976a).</p>

<p class="subtitle">THE FORMATION OF A NATIONAL ORGANIZATION</p>

<p >The movement of the unemployed had originated in local
communities, in sporadic street demonstrations, in rent riots, and in the
disruption of relief centers. Many of the local organizations were loosely
structured, held together more by the periodic demonstrations than by regular
and formal affiliations; they gathered momentum from direct action victories
which yielded money or food or a halt to evictions. But most of the radical
leaders of the different groups felt that the looseness of these local groups
was a drawback. As early as November 1930 the Communist Party political
committee criticized the absence of “organizational crystallization” in the Un
employed Councils, and a party official complained that “despite millions of
leaflets and hundreds of meetings, not to speak of the half dozen
demonstrations in every city, organized unemployed councils are almost
nonexistent” (Rosenzweig, l976b, 42).<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn32'
href="#_edn32" name="_ednref32" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[32]<![endif]></span></span></span></a></p>

<p >However bitterly the Communists, the Socialists, and the
Musteites disagreed about issues of international socialism, they shared the
view that the victories won by the unemployed in the early depression were mere
handouts. A significant political movement capable of winning major victories
depended, they thought, on firmly structured local and state organizations knit
together in a national body and with a national program.<a style='mso-endnote-id:
edn33' href="#_edn33" name="_ednref33" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[33]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
Instead of disparate local groups disrupting relief offices or leading marches
on mayors for handouts, a nationwide poor people’s organization should be
formed, an organization representing such massive voting numbers as to compel
the Congress to enact more fundamental economic reforms. The coming of the New
Deal, with a more sympathetic president and Congress, of course, encouraged
this approach, for the time seemed propitious to achieve far-reaching change
through the electoral system.</p>

<p >Moreover, a major shift in Comintern policy in 1935
(prompted by belated realization of the seriousness of the fascist threat and
the menace it posed to world communism) encouraged this emphasis on
organization and electoral strategies among the Communists, who had led the
most militant and disruptive of the unemployed groups.<a style='mso-endnote-id:
edn34' href="#_edn34" name="_ednref34" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[34]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
The “Popular Front” line called upon Communists to seek alliances with the
liberal and socialist groups they had previously denounced as “social
fascists.” This quite clearly meant seeking alliances within the New Deal
coalition and with the New Deal itself.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn35'
href="#_edn35" name="_ednref35" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[35]<![endif]></span></span></span></a></p>

<p >In fact, there were attempts to form a national
organization almost from the start. Stimulated by the successful demonstrations
of March 6, 1930, the Communists held a meeting in New York City at the end of
March, reportedly drawing together 215 delegates from thirteen states, and
calling for the formation of an autonomous national unemployment organization.<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn36' href="#_edn36" name="_ednref36" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[36]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
In July a larger meeting attracting 1,320 delegates was held in Chicago to
declare the formation of the Unemployed Councils of the USA. A platform calling
for federal unemployment insurance and federal appropriations for relief was
adopted, and a formal structure describing the relation ship between local,
city, county, state, and national groups was elaborated. By 1934 the Unemployed
Councils also adopted a written constitution (Leab, 308311). Finally the shift
in Comintern policy in 1935 set the stage not only for the development of an
organization, but for the development of an organization that would embrace all
of the unemployed groups.</p>

<p >In the fall of 1932, prompted by the upcoming election,
the Socialists had also taken steps toward the development of a national
organization.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn37' href="#_edn37" name="_ednref37"
title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[37]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
The Chicago Workers Committee called a meeting of “all Unemployed Leagues that
we know of except the Communist Party’s ‘Unemployed Councils’” (Seymour,
December 1937, 7). The result was the formation of the Federation of Unemployed
Workers Leagues of America, which called on the incoming president and the
Congress to enact legislation for direct relief, public works and slum
clearance, unemployment and old-age insurance, a shorter work day, and the
prohibition of child labor. The federation itself was short-lived, but the
conviction that a nationwide organization would be a powerful force persisted,
and the Socialist groups moved to consolidate into state federations during
1934.</p>

<p >Meanwhile, in July 1933, 800 delegates from thirteen
states showed up in Columbus, Ohio, for the first national conference of the
Unemployed Leagues. By this time, the radical intellectual leaders of the
Conference for Progressive Labor Action, who had organized the Leagues, had
become ardent believers in a “mass labor party” whose goal would be the
“complete abolition of plan less, profiteering capitalism, and the building of
a workers’ republic” (Karsh and Garman, 91).<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn38'

<p >Efforts to weld together a national organization continued
through out 1934. In March leaders from Socialist-led organizations in
Baltimore, ‘New York City, Westchester, Pittsburgh, Reading, and Hartford formed
the Eastern Federation of Unemployed and Emergency Workers. During the summer
and fall of 1934 the groups represented in the Eastern Federation met with the
Socialist-led state federations from Illinois, Wisconsin, and Florida and with
the Muste groups to plan a demonstration, out of which emerged a Provisional
National Committee to plan for the establishment of a nationwide organization
of the unemployed.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn39' href="#_edn39"

style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[39]<![endif]></span></span></span></a></p>

<p >Finally, at a conference held in Washington in early 1935,
a “permanent nonpartisan federation” of most of the large unemployed
organizations in the United States was formed, called the Workers’ Alliance of
America. Delegates attended from unemployed organizations in sixteen states.<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn40' href="#_edn40" name="_ednref40" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[40]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
A constitution was adopted, a dues system and a National Executive Committee
were established, and the Executive Committee was directed by the conference to
negotiate unification with the Communist Unemployed Councils. A second National
Workers’ Alliance Convention in April 1936 drew 900 delegates representing
organizations from thirty-six states, including the Unemployed Councils. By the
end of the year the alliance claimed 1,600 locals with a membership of 600,000
in forty-three states.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn41' href="#_edn41"

It was this convention that marked the merging of most major groups of the
unemployed: the Workers’ Alliance, the Unemployed Councils, the National
Unemployment League, the American Workers Union, and several independent state
groups. David Lasser, the Socialist who headed the New York Workers’ Committee
on Unemployment and who had been chairman of the first alliance, was again
named chairman, and Herbert Benjamin, a Communist who had been national
secretary of the Unemployed Councils, was named organizational secretary. The
Communists in the Unemployed Councils, by now well into their Popular Front
phase, deferred to the Socialists by settling for half as many seats on the new
National Executive Board. With these matters resolved, a Washington
headquarters was established, and the office and field staff expanded. State
“unity” conventions followed the national meeting and new local organizations
began to write the alliance for charters. To all appearances, a great deal had
been achieved. A national poor people’s organization had been born.</p>

<p class="subtitle">THE DECLINE OF LOCAL PROTEST</p>

<p >David Lasser, during his early efforts to forge what
became the Workers’ Alliance, had argued that a national organization would
both stimulate local organizations and give them permanence (New Leader,
December 22, 1934, 1). In fact, while the leaders of the unemployed groups had
been concentrating on forming a national organization complete with a
constitution and a bureaucratic structure, the local groups across the country
were declining. They were declining largely as a result of the Roosevelt
Administration’s more liberal relief machinery, which diverted local groups
from disruptive tactics and absorbed local leaders in bureaucratic roles. And
once the movement weakened, and the instability of which it was one expression
subsided, relief was cut back. That this happened speaks mainly to the
resiliency of the American political system. That it happened so quickly,
however, and at so cheap a price, speaks to the role played by leaders of the
unemployed themselves. For by seeking to achieve more substantial reform
through organization and electoral pressure, they forfeited local disruptions
and became, however in advertently, collaborators in the process that
emasculated the movement.</p>

<p >The ability of the local groups to attract followers had
depended on their concrete victories in the relief centers. But the expanded
administrative machinery, the readier funds, and the new aura of sympathy
provided under the Roosevelt Administration made it possible for relief
officials to regularize their agency procedures and to regain control over
relief-giving. These officials often took the view that there was no true
dichotomy of interest between themselves and the unemployed, but rather that
conflict had been fostered by group leaders who capitalized on inadequacies to
incite conflict and to exploit and manipulate the unemployed for political
purposes. What was needed were standardized procedures for dealing with
grievances according to “merit,” rather than in response to “pressure.”
(Pressure, they argued, should be exerted on legislators, not on well meaning
relief administrators.) Accordingly, they began to develop precise criteria to
determine who should get how much relief. At the same time, they introduced
elaborate formalized procedures for negotiating with organized groups of the
unemployed. In New York City, for example, guidelines for negotiations
specified that unemployed delegations should be limited to three to five per
sons; meetings were to be held no more than every two weeks and then only with
a designated staff member; unemployed delegations and the clients they
represented were never to be seen simultaneously; written answers were
forbidden; and finally, no relief was to be given while the delegation was on
the premises (emphasis added, Brophy and Hallowitz, 50-53).</p>

<p >Throughout the country, similar rules were laid down,
often through negotiations with the unemployed groups themselves. Excerpts from
one, prepared by the Pennsylvania State Office of the Consultant on Community
Contracts, illustrate the intricacy of the new procedures as well as the benign
language in which they were couched:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>“Outline Of Procedure for the Recognition of Unemployed and Labor Organizations 
    and Handling Their Complaints<o:p></o:p></i></p>
  <p><i>Representatives of the Unemployed Organization in each district will be 
    given forms supplied by the Relief Office on which each inquiry will be clearly 
    set down. (One complaint only on each blank.) The forms are to be made out 
    in duplicate.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
  <p><i>When the client, having made application, has failed to get what he believes 
    he really needs and is entitled to, after talking it over with his visitor, 
    he may, if he chooses, state the case to the chosen representative of his 
    organization, who will clearly and legibly set down the necessary information 
    on the form supplied by the Relief Office. No inquiry will be answered if 
    the client has not first taken the matter up with the visitor... The chosen 
    representative will…seek to persuade the client to omit impossible demands, 
    or those involving the change of rules and regulations governing relief over 
    which the local relief office has no control.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
  <p><i>Each complaint, in duplicate on the form specified, will be submitted 
    to the District Supervisor of the Relief Board at the regular meeting scheduled 
    for this purpose.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
  <p><i>The meeting in each relief district will take place once a week with a 
    Committee not exceeding five from the Unemployed Organization.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
  <p><i>Such cases as still appear to the Committee of the Unemployed Organization 
    to be unsatisfactorily adjusted may be submitted to the County Executive Committee 
    of the Unemployed Organization, and if on examination of these cases, the 
    County Committee feels that further action is necessary, they may submit to 
    the Executive Director for final decision…The Executive Director will receive 
    no complaints which have not conformed to this requirement.<o:p></o:p></i></p>
  <p><i>The representatives of the Unemployed Organization . . . will earnestly 
    endeavor to gain a thorough knowledge of policies and regulations and will 
    cooperate in interpreting these to their general membership (emphasis in original, 
    quoted in Seymour, Dec ember 1937, Appendix).”<o:p></o:p></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p >Within a short time, the presentation of complaints by
committees had replaced mass demonstrations in Pennsylvania. A composite of the
typical relief official’s view of the benefits of such procedures was presented
in the Survey magazine of September 1936:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>“We used to receive whatever sized groups the leaders sent in, rarely 
    less than twenty-five. The result was just a mass meeting with every body 
    out-talking everybody else. Specific charges or grievances were completely 
    lost in speechmaking against the general organization of society. Sometimes 
    we’d have half a dozen delegates in a day, keeping the office in turmoil. 
    There just wasn’t time to keep our work going and Sit in on all the speechmaking. 
    So we insisted that delegations be limited. We now . . . are able to get somewhere 
    (quoted in Seymour, December 1937, 16).”<o:p></o:p></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p >Some relief agencies not only formalized their dealings
with the unemployed groups, but saw to it that those dealings took place in a
separate complaint office or public relations office, far from the relief
centers. Chicago was one of the first places to establish such a system. The
unemployed groups there were numerous, the Workers Committee on Unemployment
alone claiming some sixty-three locals by 1933 (Karsh and Garman, 89). Repeated
local demonstrations, climaxing in several injuries, inspired the county bureau
of public welfare to establish a public relations office in January 1933, at
the same time denying the unemployed groups access to local relief stations. At
first the Chicago groups boycotted the new office, complaining of its
remoteness and asserting that it had been set up to avoid pressure from the
unemployed. The bureau held firm, how ever, and the groups gave in. The
director could then report that the new office</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>“has been and is thoroughly successful in this respect; it has relieved 
    one of the most vexatious problems of district relief administration. Individual 
    complaints, both from the justly aggrieved and the unsatisfiable, continue 
    to be received at the local office but representative committees are no longer 
    recognized there. Insomuch as some of these committees were previously disruptive 
    of all orderly procedure, the situation is vastly improved (quoted in Seymour, 
    December 1937, 22).”<o:p></o:p></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p >The introduction of a centralized grievance office
stripped the Chicago unemployed groups of their main weapon against the relief
centers. As a result, their membership declined, and internal dissension among
the groups increased (Seymour, August 1937, 81). Meanwhile, the two top leaders
of the Chicago Workers Committee on Unemployment took jobs with the Federal
Emergency Relief Administration (Rosenzweig, 1974, 35).</p>

<p >In some places, relief administrators went so far as to
induct leaders of the unemployed into the relief bureaucracy on the grounds
that Organized client groups meet a need,” and that “some process should be
developed to make group ‘vocalization’ possible. Fair hearings and similar
procedures in client group representation at advisory committee meetings should
prove to be effective in relation to special situations” (quoted in Seymour,
December 1937, 20). A report distributed by the Family Welfare Association
elaborated the new empathy of relief officialdom: “It is only as the community
understands and participates in the work that the needs of the client can be
satisfactorily met” (Seymour, August 1937, 66).<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn42'
href="#_edn42" name="_ednref42" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[42]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
Indeed, as un employed groups were inducted in these ways, they came to be more
“seasoned” and “reasonable,” and functioned as a kind of auxiliary staff, even
undertaking investigations which the agency itself did not have the facilities
to perform (Seymour, August 1937, 68). Clearly, when the unemployed acceded to
these new procedures, they did not pose much difficulty for local officials. A
Chicago relief administrator could tell a reporter that the unemployed groups
were a good thing because “They gave the men a chance to blow off steam”
(Rosenzweig, 1976a).</p>

<p >Similar procedures were developed under the work relief
program. They, too, were a stabilizing force. Beginning under the Civil Works
Administration established in 1933, and later under the Works Progress
Administration, the unemployed began to form associations modeled on trade
unions. At the beginning, they staged strikes, often successfully, for higher
wages and better working conditions. In West Virginia, for example, CWA
strikers won an increase in their hourly wages from thirty-five to forty-five
cents; in Illinois, they won an increase from forty to fifty cents. Strikes
could also result in severe penalties. Frequently the men who participated were
declared “voluntarily separated.” But with the vast expansion of federal work
relief in 1935, a new and more conciliatory federal policy began to evolve.
Workers were conceded the right to organize and to select representatives to
negotiate with relief officials; grievance procedures and appeals boards were
established; state administrators were instructed in the maintenance of fair
and friendly relations with workers. With these arrangements in place, the
president himself declared work relief strikes illegal and authorized
administrators to replace striking men.</p>

<p >Some leaders of the unemployed, it should be acknowledged,
feared entanglement with the bureaucracies which administered direct relief or
work relief, and urged resistance. The Communist Party organizers, schooled in
the militancy of the early 1930s, were especially inclined to ignore grievance
procedures, at least at first.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn43' href="#_edn43"
name="_ednref43" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[43]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
(The Socialists had never explicitly endorsed riot-like tactics.) But when
relief officials held firm, Communist leaders sometimes found that urging more
abrasive tactics imperiled their standing with their members (Brophy and
Hallowitz, 8). Most local leaders, believing cooperation would yield them significant
influence over relief policies hailed the bureaucratic reforms, and
relinquished the use of confrontation tactics. They acceded to the new
grievance procedures, agreed to the elaborate rules on how negotiations should
be conducted, and allowed themselves to become “client participants” or
“consultants” on agency policy (on occasion to find themselves being lectured
on the more constructive uses of their leisure time). The whole development
appeared to be a forward-looking one, certainly in the view of relief
administrators, the more progressive of whom prided themselves on cooperating
with the movement’s leader ship by helping to “educate” the poor so that they
could move from primitive “pressure tactics” to a more sophisticated level of
political action, by which they meant lobbying with legislatures and
negotiating with administrators, instead of disrupting relief offices.</p>

<p >The irony was not that relief administrators held these
views, but that many of the leaders of the unemployed did as well. The earlier
successes of the unemployed movement in obtaining benefits for people had not
been won by lobbying or negotiating, or by using standardized complaint
procedures. (If there was an effective lobby at work, it was composed of local
political officials who were extremely hard pressed by rising relief costs. The
United States Conference of Mayors, for example, was formed during this period
expressly for the purpose of persuading the federal government to provide
financial assistance to localities for relief expenditures.) What leverage
these groups had exerted on local relief officials resulted from the very
disturbances, the “pressure tactics,” which both leaders and administrators
later scorned as primitive. Victories in obtaining relief had been won by mobilizing
people for abrasive demonstrations and by demanding benefits on the spot for
hundreds of people. By abandoning disruptive tactics in favor of bureaucratic
procedures, the movement lost the ability to influence relief decisions in the
local offices. No longer able to produce tangible benefits, the alliance also
lost the main inducement by which it had activated great numbers of people.
There was in the end no mass constituency, however impermanent, in whose name
and with whose support it could negotiate. With the force of the movement lost,
with its local leaders engaged in bureaucratic minuets, and with its national
leaders concentrating on legislative reform through the electoral system,
relief officials soon regained control over the relief centers, and the
national administration regained control of relief policy.</p>

<p class="subtitle">THE CONTRACTION OF RELIEF</p>

<p >Even as radical leaders exerted themselves to form a
national organization, dramatic changes had taken place in relief policy. In
October 1934 Roosevelt declared that direct relief should be terminated. His
message was familiar, echoing as it did age-old beliefs: “Continued dependence
upon relief induces a spiritual and moral disintegration fundamentally
destructive to the national fiber. . . . We must pre serve not only the bodies
of the unemployed from destitution but also their self-respect, their
self-reliance and courage and determination.” Accordingly, “The Federal
Government must quit this business of [direct] relief” (Schlesinger, 1960, 267-268).</p>

<p >Instead of direct relief, the president called for a
public works program to provide a job for every able-bodied person, and to that
end requested an unprecedented $4 billion appropriation, to be supplemented by
$880 million unspent under previous emergency relief appropriations. As for
those who could not work, which included some 1.5 million families or
individuals currently receiving federal emergency assistance, they would be
turned over to the states and localities, as before the New Deal. Under the
Social Security Act of 1935, however, the federal government would pay for a
share of these state and local relief costs.</p>

<p >At first glance, the president’s new programs seemed a
bold reform, bolder by far than the federal relief program, and a victory for
the unemployed. The jobless workers of the country would no longer need to
subsist on the degrading dole. Government would put them to work, and put them
to work at rebuilding America.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn44' href="#_edn44"
name="_ednref44" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[44]<![endif]></span></span></span></a></p>

<p >Meanwhile, those who could not work would be cared for by
the states and localities, affirming America’s tradition of local
responsibility for the indigent. But while the new federal programs might have
been equal to the imagination of reformers persuaded by promises of massive
federal action to help the unemployed, they were to turn out in reality to be
far from equal to the magnitude of need, or indeed even to the magnitude of the
president’s promises. Instead of 3.5 million jobs, the Works Progress
Administration actually provided an average of about 2 million during its first
five years of operation. Moreover, job quotas fluctuated wildly from month to
month, in no apparent relation to unemployment, so that project workers never
knew when they might be laid off. In any case, those who got on were the lucky
ones. At its peak, WPA accounted for only about one in four of the estimated
unemployed (Howard, 854-857).<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn45' href="#_edn45"
name="_ednref45" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[45]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
Thus, in 1936, when WPA provided about 2.5 million jobs, nearly 10 million were
still unemployed.</p>

<p >With direct federal relief abolished, the great mass of
the unemployed, together with the old, the infirm, and the orphaned, were once
again forced to turn to state and local relief agencies, which as a practical
matter could not handle the burden, and which as a political matter no longer
had to. Some localities scaled down their grants; others simply abolished
relief. Distress was especially severe in some industrial states, such as Ohio,
Pennsylvania, and Illinois. In New Jersey licenses to beg were issued instead
of relief (Seymour, December 1937, 9). Texas simply refused relief to the
able-bodied (<i>Washington Post</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, February
6, 1936). Early in 1936 FERA and WPA initiated several local surveys to
ascertain what had happened to former recipients of direct federal relief who
did not subsequently get on the WPA rolls. In one area after another they found
large numbers of people in dire need, without food or fuel. Some were
struggling to live on the pittance granted by local relief agencies; less lucky
ones begged, or searched through garbage cans.</span><a style='mso-endnote-id:
edn46' href="#_edn46" name="_ednref46" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[46]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
And in February 1936 Dr. Harry Ward, a professor at Union Theological Seminary,
made a nationwide tour and reported to the press that people were slowly
starving to death as a result of relief cuts (<i>New York Post</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>, February 13, 1936).</span></p>

<p >These hardships provoked some new protests. In Fall River,
Massachusetts, men cut off the WPA rolls stormed the City Hall (<i>Boston Globe</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>, January 26, 1936). In New York City some 200 relief
recipients demonstrated at City Hall (</span><i>New York Times</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>, June 27, 1936). In May 1936, a month after the
alliance convention, 5,000 marchers organized by the New Jersey Workers
Alliance descended on the state house when relief funds ran out. Later that
summer, a similar march took place at the Pennsylvania state house. In the fall
of 1936 alliance leaders conducted work stoppages and demonstrations on WPA
projects to demand more adequate security wages and to protest layoffs (Karsh
and Garman, 93-94).</span></p>

<p >While in a few instances demonstrators got promises from
state and local officials, none of this much moved Washington. One reason was that
the almost unanimous support for relief measures in 1933 had evaporated.
Business was improving (although unemployment was hardly diminishing); local
finances were no longer in a shambles; and what sentiment remained in favor of
relief had been assuaged by the bold new programs of 1935. Meanwhile, with the
worst of the national crisis apparently passed, opposition to relief in all its
forms was rising, especially in the business community. A sample of press
opinion at the time provides some inkling of that opposition, and the
historically familiar reasons for it. <i>The Chicago Tribune</i><span
style='font-style:normal'>, on November 23, 1935, ran a story headlined “Relief
Clients Refuse to Work as Corn Pickers” followed by an account of a survey of
nine counties and the excuses that relief clients used to avoid working in the
corn fields. </span><i>The Los Angeles Examiner</i><span style='font-style:
normal'>, on November 5, 1935, under the headline “Farm Loss in Millions” also
explained to its readers that people on the dole refused to work; </span><i>The
New Mexican</i><span style='font-style:normal'> had a similar complaint on March
6, 1936, telling its readers that sheepmen could not get herders because they
were on relief at forty dollars a month. The next day the Indianapolis News
editorialized about the waste of relief, and especially about the inability of
private employers to compete with the pay and working conditions provided by
WPA. And on March 30, 1936, the New York Times summed up press opinion with an
editorial explaining the importance of cutting work relief costs. There is no
right to work, pontificated the editors; the protests merely indicate the
“demoralization wrought by ill-advised schemes of relief.”</span></p>

<p >But it was not only that the political climate had
changed. The unemployed themselves were less of a threat, and so less had to be
done for them. They were less of a threat partly because their numbers had been
divided. Many of the most competent and able had been absorbed into the new
work projects; some had even been hired to work in the relief centers. Many
others had been shunted to the residual state and local direct relief programs.
The remainder were left with nowhere to turn, but their numbers were reduced
and their sense of indignation blunted by New Deal reforms. All of this was
made easier, however, by the directions local affiliates of the Workers’ Alliance
had taken in the local centers. It remained to be seen what the alliance would
achieve as a national lobbying force.</p>

<p class="subtitle">Organization and Electoral Influence</p>

<p >The Workers’ Alliance of America, committed from the start
to obtaining reform through lobbying, reacted to the administration’s new
programs by attacking the White House for its empty promises and drafting a
relief bill of its own. The bill did not brook com promise. It called for a $6
billion relief appropriation for the seventeen-month period from February 1,
1936, to June 30, 1937; for relief at decent standards; and for “security
wages” on work projects equal to trade union scales. The alliance used its
network to deluge the White House with postcards, telegrams, and petitions. But
the bill failed by overwhelming margins in the Congress.</p>

<p >This did not deter the alliance leaders from the strategy
of per suasion and coalition on which they had embarked. If anything,
Roosevelt’s initiatives in other areas during 1935; the Wagner Act, the Wealth
Tax Act, and the Social Security Act, for example, had the consequence of
moderating whatever abrasiveness their earlier rhetoric had contained. The
second alliance convention was held in the Department of Labor auditorium, and
Roosevelt himself was invited to address the delegates (Rosenzweig, 1974, 35).
Roosevelt declined, but Nels Anderson, Director of Labor Relations for the WPA,
addressed the friendly convention instead. David Lasser subsequently described
himself as the New Deal’s spur on the left: “We had an agreement with Harry
Hopkins always to ask for snore” (Rosenzweig, 1974, 33).</p>

<p >But the agreement was to, ask, not to get. Aubrey
Williams, Hopkins’ deputy, scolded an alliance delegation that demanded an
increase in WPA wages, instructing them to “lay your problems before Congress
when it comes back. Don’t embarrass your friends” (Rosenzweig, 1974, 34). And,
in April 1937, when alliance leaders met with Harry Hopkins to again demand an
increase in WPA wages, Hopkins simply turned them down.</p>

<p >As if following the instructions of New Deal officials,
leaders of the alliance, now based in Washington, D.C., began to cultivate
relations with several friendly senators and congressmen during the spring of
1937, and regularized its cordial relationship with WPA officials. The alliance
had been recognized as the official bargaining agent for WPA workers, and
alliance leaders now corresponded frequently with WPA administrators,
communicating a host of complaints, and discussing innumerable procedural
questions regarding WPA administrative regulations. Some of the complaints were
major, having to do with pay cuts and arbitrary layoffs. Much of the
correspondence, however, had to do with minute questions of procedure, and
especially with the question of whether WPA workers were being allowed to make
up the time lost while attending alliance meetings.</p>

<p >Alliance leaders also wrote regularly to the president,
reviewing the economic situation for him, deploring cuts in WPA, and calling
for an expansion of the program (correspondence between David Lasser, Herbert
A. Benjamin, Aubrey Williams, David Niles, Colonel F. C. Harrington, and
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, WPA files).</p>

<p >In June 1937 the third annual convention of the Workers’
Alliance, meeting in Milwaukee, called for an appropriation of $3 billion for
work relief and $1 billion for direct relief, as well as the establishment of a
national planning commission to plan permanent public works programs. The
alliance also sponsored the Schwellenbach Allen Resolution, which provided that
no WPA worker could be discharged who was unable to find suitable private
employment. The resolution never reached the floor of the Congress. In fact,
Congress adjourned two days before an alliance-sponsored national march reached
Washington to lobby for the measure, despite the presence of an advance
contingent of hundreds of marchers (Benjamin).<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn47'
href="#_edn47" name="_ednref47" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[47]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
Instead, Harry Hopkins agreed to establish another joint committee with the
alliance to develop plans for a WPA labor relations board.</p>

<p >When a new and severe recession hit in the winter of
1937-1938, there was a wave of small demonstrations by the unemployed across
the country. But there is no evidence that the national alliance called for
them, or that its local organizers mobilized them. The protests appear to have
occurred in cities where the unemployed had not been previously organized; not
much happened in New York or Chicago, for example, which had been former
strongholds of alliance groups.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn48' href="#_edn48"

style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[48]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
Only in Detroit did large numbers gather, and then at a rally sponsored by the
newly formed United Auto Workers to protest inadequate relief after layoffs in
the auto industry (State Journal, Lansing, Michigan, February 5, 1938).<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn49' href="#_edn49" name="_ednref49" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[49]<![endif]></span></span></span></a></p>

<p >Undaunted by its earlier legislative failures,<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn50' href="#_edn50" name="_ednref50" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[50]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
the alliance continued to propose legislative programs, and to cement its
relations with the administration. In March 1938 the alliance called a National
Conference on Work and Security to “hammer out a real program” of social
reconstruction (Rodman). To ensure receptivity to its proposals, the alliance
mobilized itself to support the national Democratic ticket in the fall
elections. The lead story in an issue of its newspaper <i>WORK</i><span
style='font-style:normal'> dated October 22, 1938, emblazoned with the headline
ALLIANCE SWINGS FORCES INTO NOVEMBER ELECTION CAMPAIGN, provides a description
of these efforts:</span></p>

</blockquote>
<p >Events would soon demonstrate how powerful the
organization was. The electoral efforts of the alliance were not sufficient to
command even token responses from the National Administration. When the
alliance invited Aubrey Williams, deputy administrator of WPA to speak at its
September 1938 convention, he turned them down. When they substituted Father
Francis J. Haas, a New Deal official, he cancelled at the last minute, but not
before some 100,000 leaflets had been distributed which carried his name.</p>

<p >More important, WPA funds were cut in 1939 after Congress
had introduced provisions that both reduced WPA wages and compelled Workers to
be terminated who had been on the WPA rolls for eighteen continuous months. The
leadership of the alliance, as was its wont, called a National Right-to-Work
Congress, and on June 13 Lasser and Benjamin respectfully submitted the
opinions of the assembled delegates of the unemployed to the president. The un
employed, they said, had called for public works and government measures to
stimulate the economy, but assured the president that ‘It is the conviction of
the people represented in our Congress that the failure to achieve recovery to
date could not be laid at the door of your administration.” They concluded with
this mild reproach:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>“The congress also asked us to convey to you the feeling of disappointment 
    at the inadequate request for funds for work for the unemployed for the coming 
    12 months. This disappointment was especially keen because the delegates could 
    not reconcile your request with your generous and sound philosophy on this 
    question, so enthusiastically endorsed by them. . . and expressed the hope 
    that your administration could see fit, before it is too late, to reconsider 
    its estimate in the light of present day economic and business conditions. 
    The delegates wished us to convey to you their heartfelt appreciation for 
    your wise and courageous leadership, and to express our earnest hope for a 
    program which will make it possible for them to do their part as Americans 
    to help achieve recovery, security and plenty for our country and its people.”<o:p></o:p></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p >A few weeks later Lasser followed the letter with a
telegram. The tone was more urgent, ending with a request for permission to
release the telegram to the press. Lasser was informed by the White House to do
as he pleased (WPA files).</p>

<p >In fact, the alliance was of no political consequence. The
end had already come, and was evident by the fourth annual convention in
September 1938, which drew only five hundred delegates. The long succession of
legislative defeats, and the bureaucratic envelopment which caused a decline of
grassroots protests, had taken their toll. Membership and militancy had ebbed.
Cleavages among the various factions widened; embittered and frustrated, the
disparate groups that remained began to fall out. In 1940 David Lasser resigned
to take a job with the WPA, and a year later the Workers’ Alliance of America
was quietly dissolved.</p>

<p class="subtitle">CONCLUSION</p>

<p >The Workers’ Alliance of America had lofty aspirations.
Until 1937 its constitution called for “abolition of the profit system,”
although its language became more moderate as its commitment to the New Deal
became more ardent. Its legislative proposals included, among other things,
all-inclusive unemployment insurance to be paid for by individual and corporate
income taxes, and to be ad ministered by workers and farmers. Communists,
Socialists, Musteites, Trotskyites, and other unaffiliated radicals had agreed
on the importance of building a national organization to exert electoral
pressure for these reforms.<a style='mso-endnote-id:edn51' href="#_edn51"
name="_ednref51" title=""><span class=MsoEndnoteReference><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[51]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
But even while the alliance leaders were taking pride in their organizational
structure and their dues-paying membership, and were inventing far-reaching
legislative reforms, their local affiliates had become entangled in
bureaucratic procedures and were declining. That leadership failed to
understand that government does not need to meet the demands of an organized
van guard in order to assuage mass unrest, although it does have to deal with
the unrest itself. One way that government deals with unrest is through the
vanguard. By creating a political climate that encouraged faith in the
possibility of national electoral influence, the New Deal destroyed the
incentive of the leaders of the unemployed to exacerbate disorder.<a
style='mso-endnote-id:edn52' href="#_edn52" name="_ednref52" title=""><span
class=MsoEndnoteReference><span style='font-size:10.0pt'><span
style='mso-special-character:footnote'><![if !supportFootnotes]>[52]<![endif]></span></span></span></a>
And by instituting procedures on the local level that subverted the use of
disruptive tactics, the New Deal undermined the ability of the leaders of the
unemployed to exacerbate disorder. Once that process had unfolded, the Workers’
Alliance of America no longer mattered, one way or the other.</p>

<p >The particular tragedy of the Workers’ Alliance is not
that it failed to achieve the fundamental reforms to which it was committed.
Achievements of that order are the result of forces larger than leaders alone
can muster, and the alliance was neither the first to try nor the last to fail.
Rather, if there is a tragedy, it is in the role the alliance played during the
brief and tumultuous period when people were ready to act against the
authorities and against the norms that ordinarily bind them. Instead of
exploiting the possibilities of the time by pushing turbulence to its outer
limits, the leaders of the unemployed set about to build organization and to
press for legislation, and in so doing, they virtually echoed the credo of
officialdom itself.</p>

<p >For a brief time, there were twenty million people on the
relief rolls, but millions more badly needed relief and never got it. And when
the alliance abandoned the relief centers to lobby for lofty programs of basic
change, those millions on relief were abandoned too: the rolls were cut back
and millions who were still unemployment were once again left destitute. The
tragedy, in sum, is that the alliance did not win as much as it could, while it
could.</p>

you’re not human. You’re out of place. You’re so different from all the rest of
the people around that you think something is wrong with you” (1934, 63). But
clearly once people realized that by being out of work they were just the same
as people around them, demoralization could more easily turn to indignation.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

style='font-size:9.0pt'> In a personal communication to one of us, Benjamin
takes strong exception to our views of the alliance activities. It is worth
quoting his opinions at length: “You seem unaware that our ‘lobbying’
activities differed very greatly from what is generally termed lobbying. We
engaged in mass lobbying; angry delegations besieging reactionary members of
Congress in their offices. We marched and picketed and were arrested. We
appeared before legislative committees not to plead but to demand. And we
engaged in electoral activities that demonstrated, to some members of Congress
at least, that we did have political clout that they would disregard only at
their peril. (The WAA, contrary to your thesis, was credited with among others
defeating the supposedly unshakable chairman of the powerful Rules Committee.)
In your opinion, it was more important to disrupt some local relief office over
some petty grievance of an individual. We found that it was more important to
establish decent standards and regulations through mass actions and then handle
routine matters in the way a shop chairman handles grievances. And our
executive Board and conventions, speaking for our membership, approved our
policies. So we prepared and fought for the (Marcantonio) Relief and Work
Standards Act and helped our local organizations prepare local ordinances
modeled on this bill. We fought for higher relief appropriations to provide
more WPA jobs and higher wage scales. . , . Your basic error, my good friend,
is that you start with an incorrect premise. . . . The struggle of the
unemployed is a political struggle. It is directed against the political
institutions, the agencies of government who make policies and appropriate
funds. Our job was to make this clear to backward workers who did not
understand that they had a right and therefore should not plead but demand and
light. It was easy to get them to raise hell with a social worker about their
own immediate grievances. We taught them to go beyond this to a higher level of
political action. And this was the most important contribution we made to the
political education and development of the American workers” (underlining in
the original, August 8, 1976). We are grateful for the opportunities to cite Benjamin’s
disagreements with our analysis so his own words. We think his comments help to
make clear that the alliance leaders were neither weak nor opportunistic. But
we believe that they were mistaken in restricting their understanding of
“political institutions” to legislative and executive bodies; the relief system
was also a political institution, and in the midst of the depression an
important one. We think they were also mistaken in failing to recognize the
relationship between massive local disruptions and the actions taken by
legislative and executive bodies.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

keep the organization alive if we were unwilling to demonstrate against the

evaluation of the outcome of alliance strategies, we see little evidence that
party leaders of the alliance took a different stance. We should also note that
Sexton disagrees with our interpretation in other respects, arguing that the
alliance flourished under the bureaucratization of relief, and the
bureaucratization of its own Internal structure, and was destroyed only by its
unwillingness to demonstrate against New Deal officialdom a policy that Sexton
