<blockquote> 
  <p class="subtitle"><font size="2">In the anarcho-primitivist film <i>Fight 
    Club, </i>its central character, Tyler Durden, has a message for those who 
    think they run society and that we exist to meet their needs:</font></p>
  <p class="subtitle"><font size="2"><i>&quot;</i><em>The people you're after 
    are everyone you depend on. We do your laundry, cook your food and serve you 
    dinner. We guard you while you sleep. We drive your ambulances.</em></font><em><b><font size="2"> 
    </font></b><font size="2">DO NOT FUCK WITH US!</font></em><font size="2">&quot;</font></p>
  <p class="subtitle">&nbsp;</p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">&quot;It has become an article of the creed 
    of modern morality that all labour is good in itself; a convenient belief 
    to those who live on the wealth of others.&quot;&nbsp; --William Morris, <i>Useful 
    Work vs Useless Toil </i>1885</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Let’s face it, work as we know and loathe it 
  today, sucks. Anybody who has worked for a wage or a salary will confirm that. 
  Work, for the vast majority of us, is forced labour. And it feels like it too! 
  Whether you’re working on a casual or temporary basis and suffer all the insecurity 
  that involves or are ‘lucky’ enough to have a permanent position where job security 
  tightens like a noose around your neck, it’s pretty much the same. Work offers 
  it all: physical and nervous exhaustion, illness and, more often than not, mind-numbing 
  boredom. You can add the feeling of being shafted for the benefit of someone 
  else’s profit to the list.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Work eats up our lives. It dominates every aspect 
  of our existence. When we’re not at the job we’re travelling to or from it, 
  preparing or recovering from it, trying to forget about it or attempting to 
  escape from it in what is laughably called our ‘leisure’ time. Work is a truly 
  offensive four-letter word too horrifying to contemplate. We sacrifice the best 
  part of our waking lives to work in order to survive in order to work. It’s 
  a kind of drug, numbing us, clouding our minds with the wage packet and all 
  the ‘benefits’ of consumerism it brings. Apart from the basic fact that if you 
  don’t work and would rather not accept the pittance of state benefits you don’t 
  eat, wage slaves are dragooned into ‘gainful employment’ by ideologies designed 
  to persuade us of the personal and social necessity of ‘having a job’.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Of course there is resistance to work, refusal 
  to work, revolts against work, if largely unreported. Its an interesting fact 
  that in 2002 in Britain, there were 33m working days lost to stress, 60 times 
  more than the 550,000 lost to strikes. That is more than the number of days 
  work lost to industrial action in the supposedly dark days of the late 1970s, 
  a period of ‘industrial chaos’ that led to Thatcher’s rise. A generation of 
  political battle, legislation and public policy to destroy the trade union movement 
  and suppress industrial conflict has been spectacularly subverted. Well, what 
  did <i>they</i> expect?</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="subtitle">ANCIENT IDEAS ALIVE TODAY</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font SIZE="2">&quot;If work were so pleasant, the rich 
    would keep it for themselves</font></i><font SIZE="2">&quot; - Mark Twain</font></p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="2">The western model of civilisation is riddled 
  with the idea that progress derives from a privileged and leisured class supported 
  by a toiling, managed and controlled under-class. Ancient Greek civilization, 
  the model for modern democracies, depended entirely on a captive population 
  of helots, or slaves, to maintain it’s aristocrats, thinkers, poets, artists 
  and soldiers in luxury and leisure. Across the ancient world, slavery and many 
  forms of bonded labour were the ‘norm’ and many of the so-called great civilisations 
  were built on the toil and misery of millions of powerless and despised workers.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">An identifiable ideology of work began to take 
  shape with the decline of slavery and the emergence of feudalism. Many medieval 
  peasant uprisings and heretical movements proclaimed the poverty of Christ and 
  tried to reclaim the ‘common bounty’ of the earth from the priests and nobles 
  who had stolen it. They proclaimed earthly utopias where the power of church 
  and nobility to enforce work through taxation would be ended by sharing out 
  the wealth of both amongst the poor. This new ideology of equality and equity 
  was deeply threatening to both Church and State. In response, the idea of work 
  as a divinely ordained and spiritual activity began to be preached from the 
  pulpits. Those who worked gained a new status in a divine hierarchy that had 
  nobles and priests at the top, sturdy yeomen in the middle, peasant below. The 
  free spirits who resisted domestication, ‘the sturdy beggars’ of our history 
  books, were vilified and persecuted by draconian laws against vagrancy and vagabondage. 
  Individuals who had not been integrated into the economy were portrayed as lazy 
  and ungodly outlaws and forced into what would eventually become the embryonic 
  working class.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The ideas of the Reformation contained within 
  them the source of our current problem. Work was divinely ordained but the reward 
  of work, wealth and status, would set us free to perform God’s good works. Members 
  of the ‘new’ religions, like Calvinism, dedicated themselves to working hard 
  and accumulating wealth, mute witness to the favour God had bestowed upon them. 
  This single-minded, methodical and disciplined ideology was highly useful to 
  the emerging capitalist classes who were, in many countries, the religious classes 
  as well. It also provided a theory of society that persuaded people that it 
  was better to be ‘free’ (by which they meant a wage slave at the mercy of the 
  master who needs labour) than the benighted serf of medieval times. As a result 
  capitalism fundamentally changed the nature of work.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="subtitle">SURPLUS VALUE &amp; THE CREATION OF TYRANNY</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font size="2">The universal conversion of life into labour 
    is the capitalist means of domination</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">For two hundred years industrial capitalism 
  consolidated it’s grip on society (though not without considerable and violent 
  working class resistance). It’s almost impossible now to realize that virtually 
  everything produced by society (except those requiring collective effort like 
  mining, brewing or baking) was owned by those who produced it, who were able 
  to control the value of their labour through the price they were prepared to 
  sell it for. The ‘success’ of the factory system meant that capitalism had a 
  means to create vast numbers of jobs but at the price of workers surrendering 
  this power and with it, freedom itself.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">New laws were passed which restricted the ability 
  of people to work on a temporary or casual basis. Existence without means of 
  visible support became a crime as the industrial masters sought to discipline 
  free peasants and artisans into docile factory armies. To the stick of social 
  stigma, the workhouse and prison for those who refused to work, the bosses added 
  the carrot of permanent employment for the loyal and humble worker, wage differentials 
  for skilled and semi-skilled labour, a mythic social prestige for the ‘kings 
  of labour’ (miners, steelworkers and the like). The ‘job for life’ became our 
  dream and was offered in periods of healthy capitalism then withheld when recession 
  or the need to restructure capitalism arrived. Wage labour became ‘normal’. 
  Unemployment became a moral not social problem and those without work weren’t 
  lucky but ‘victims’, poor unfortunates who deserved to be ‘helped’. This ideology 
  persists despite the best efforts of people like ourselves to get across the 
  basic fact that unemployment is created by capitalism and no-one else. Large 
  numbers of people continue to blame themselves for their unemployed state, for 
  their poverty and lack of any human worth, an attitude the state sees no reason 
  to change.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The work ethic was further reinforced by encouraging 
  workers to identify themselves with their work. Miner’s villages, working men’s 
  clubs, factory leagues, trades unions, the occupational pension; they were all 
  a kind of tribal loyalty to ourselves and our master that divided workers from 
  each other as much as it united them. This tribalism was reinforced by craft 
  and trade unionism that encouraged skilled workers to regard themselves as a 
  special case and to practice mutual aid and solidarity only within their own 
  trade.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">This deliberate attempt to create a homogeneous 
  working class whose (apparent) self-interest was deeply entwined with that of 
  the ruling class, through certain institutions like social democratic governments, 
  the church and trade unions, reached a peak in corporatist states like Franco’s 
  Spain and Peron’s Argentina in the 1950s-1970s. But towards the end of this 
  period it went into reverse. Capitalism needed to increase demand for its products 
  following the massive contraction of credit (which funds most purchasing in 
  the West) in the 1970s due to the oil-related hyper-inflation and credit squeeze. 
  It did so by using the relative weakness of the working class at the time and 
  the opening of factories in low-wage countries to massively expand the range 
  of goods available. At the same time it promoted the idea of the consumer as 
  an <i>individu</i>al, somebody whose identity, status and sense of self-worth 
  was determined by the things that they bought and displayed, whether on the 
  body, the road or in the home.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">This process, which has created an apparently 
  fixated, mass consumption society defined primarily not by demographics but 
  by patterns of consumption also destroyed the homogeneity, identity and solidarity 
  of the working class. Of course, this process was not started everywhere at 
  the same time. May corporatist states such as Japan, South Korea and Malaysia 
  still exist though some of their ruling elites complain about the increasing 
  fragmentation of society and alienation of the citizen from anything other than 
  consumption. At the same time, the commodification of society has not spread 
  throughout every society and sometimes does not reach into every community. 
  There are still many places where people may wear the no-longer fashionable 
  tee-shirt or locally-produced fake trainers and still riot when the ruling class 
  turn the screws too tight! But capitalism continues to try and spread its message 
  about the personal value of work and consumption to the individual, rather than 
  to society or within a social context, stealthily undermining the ideas and 
  power of community and mutuality.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Work in its present state is, then, an entirely 
  artificial condition. It is not freely chosen, is not a universal and integrated 
  part of family and society, provides neither intellectual nor spiritual fulfilment 
  for most people and is extremely harmful to mind, body and spirit. Everything 
  that was a good about work ­ the sense of vocation, personal choice, creativity, 
  fulfilment, the sense of value of the individual-in-society ­ has been destroyed 
  for all but a relative handful of artists, craft workers and a few of the ‘professions’. 
  For the rest of us it has become meaningless drudgery from which only death 
  releases us. It is a prison without cages (except for those being worked by 
  the prison-industrial complex) whose governors are the ruling class and whose 
  warders are the bosses, teachers, social workers, employment agencies, police 
  and judicial systems.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"class="subtitle">WHY WORK TODAY IS A TERRIBLE ORDEAL</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font size="2">“The tragedy is that those who work, work 
    so much they are no longer human. Those who don't work are reduced to a miserable 
    existence amidst the spectacle of plenty”.</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">How old are you when you first realise that 
  having to work for a living is crap? Maybe you’ve always known that work ­as 
  described by parents, teachers or politicians ­ was not for you. Perhaps the 
  utter futility and meaninglessness of work, in personal terms, has come crashing 
  into your life, or crept up on you year by miserable year. Whichever and however 
  you’ve got to here, you’re now, perhaps, aware that most people hate work and 
  spend their lives in a constant struggle against its imposition. They battle 
  to get beyond and out of being ‘only’ working class. They may succeed, but at 
  what cost?</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>INDUSTRIALISATION &amp; MECHANISATION</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">In an earlier period, when capitalism was not 
  securely established, workers battled against it in the hope of avoiding it 
  altogether. Very largely they did this by smashing machines and threatening 
  their owners [others attempted to create model communities ­ sometimes it was 
  the same people]. Today the word ‘Luddite’ - used to describe these people - 
  has become an insult, a way of avoiding raising the question of work at all. 
  It just shows how much we have lost control over our own history. When it became 
  clear that capitalism could not be avoided, then our struggle became one of 
  trying to minimise its impact on our lives. The ‘standard’ eight-hour day, the 
  weekend off, premium payments for night and working anti-social hours were all 
  a product of these struggles. If capitalism is so endlessly productive and beneficial, 
  why have these ‘rights’ largely disappeared, been reclaimed by capital? Is it 
  because capitalism can only make profit by driving down the cost of labour or 
  exporting jobs to places where labour costs a few pence per day? Industrialisation 
  and mechanisation was not introduced simply to increase production and profit, 
  spreading this bounty to the four corners of the world. It was introduced deliberately 
  to control and discipline workers (to the needs of the machine, the rhythms 
  of production). New technology does not liberate workers, it cages them, reducing 
  their power to resist the demands of capitalism and is always a response to 
  the struggle of workers either to free themselves from the power of the bosses 
  or to seize a greater share of the wealth they themselves create. What drives 
  industrialisation is not progress or profit-making but the need to dominate 
  and control a fiercely resisting working class and discipline them to the acceptance 
  and necessity of work.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>TAYLORISM &amp; FORDISM</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">This process began with the very first machines 
  and factories built during the Industrial Revolution. It provoked a hundred 
  years of struggle against the factory and against the fact that workers could 
  no longer say when and where they would work, the factory master did. This resistance 
  was never defeated and, in fact, intensified right up to the start of the Great 
  War. This was the period when the industrial working class challenged capitalism 
  most strongly, the age of the mass strike and working class insurrections against 
  both state and capital.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Capital’s response, once it conceded that it 
  could no longer absolutely exploit our living time, was to bring in technology 
  so that the time it could get from us could be used more effectively. The scientific 
  approach to analysing work and maximising productivity by controlling it was 
  called ‘Taylorism’ and was one of the main shackles placed on workers (along 
  with factory work, employment contracts and the conveyor belt). But Taylorism 
  merely aroused fierce antagonism and resistance within the industrial working 
  class, especially the powerful craft unions. In order to bypass these powerful 
  obstacles to profit-making, new technology was introduced to increase the productivity 
  of workers and replace craft working.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The greatest exponent of this trend was Henry 
  Ford, who dramatically demonstrated the concept of relative surplus value by 
  doing what at the time ­ the early 20th Century ­ was considered impossible. 
  He paid workers 4 or 5 times the ‘going rate’ (actually the bare minimum that 
  could be screwed from the bosses), yet still made a huge profit. By vastly increasing 
  the production of relative surplus value through the use of the assembly line, 
  coupled with FW Taylor’s ‘scientific management’ of the work process, he was 
  able to vastly improve the productivity of his plants. This was a true [capitalist] 
  revolution and its effects are still with us today.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">This story is fairly well known. Less well known 
  is what Ford and his like also brought into existence, and that was the <i>worker</i> 
  of the assembly lines, sometimes known as the ‘mass worker’. Whereas before 
  the capitalist had relied largely on skilled workers to manage the production 
  process ­ and in some countries and industries this is still the case ­ the 
  mass worker was a new type. During the development of the working class, it 
  discovered the secret of the production of relative surplus value and learned 
  to exploit this knowledge in its struggle for a fairer share of the product 
  of the national economies of the industrialised world. This in part explains 
  the powerful workerist movements of the 1940s-1980s.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">At first capitalist states attempted to contain 
  and demobilise working class resistance by granting it a greater share of the 
  social product, running up big budget deficits in the process. In the UK we 
  had prices and incomes policies and at plant level many non-existent productivity 
  deals were negotiated. But this economic response to a new social reality failed 
  to contain the working class. In Western Europe, the most frightening aspect 
  of the long campaigns against Fordism during this period was not the ever-increasing 
  wage demands ­ which could, after all be accommodated within capitalism ­ but 
  the rejection in many places of the system of ‘factory discipline’ itself; though 
  occupations, strikes, sabotage, marches and riot. In France, Italy, US and the 
  UK in the late 1960s and early 1970s we saw a period of more or less open class 
  struggle. Always at the centre of these struggles was this new ‘mass’ worker. 
  All attempts to contain this mass worker ­ who had discovered that the Fordist 
  system could be destroyed by collective action - failed. ‘Scientific management’ 
  was no answer to workers who collectively could impose their will on the productive 
  process. In Britain the attempt to buy off the workers ended with the intervention 
  of the IMF in 1976, severe recession, the period of <i>defensive </i>struggle 
  from 1978-1983 and the long-term demobilisation of the working class following 
  the Miners Strike of 1984-85. Monetarist policies of the 1980s were re-introduced 
  as within each nation state attempts were made to limit the share of the social 
  product going to labour.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Capital never solved this problem ­ instead 
  it attempted to avoid it altogether by moving to a new stage. First austerity 
  policies were deliberately introduced to break the ‘cycle’ of wage demands, 
  inflation and more wage demands. This brought about the biggest unemployment 
  level since the 1930s. With the mass worker now relatively subdued but still 
  looking to the unions who were an integral part of the imposition of the austerity 
  measures, the stage was set for a more long-term strategy. Capital became more 
  mobile ­ that is it ran away from an insurgent industrial working class to exploit 
  a global proletariat ­ globally. This necessitated changes in technology, especially 
  communications technology that was needed to monitor and control a productive 
  process that was now geographically disparate. But crucially it also needed 
  an ideological offensive to sell the new form of work to a new working class.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The result of this has been the intensification 
  and lengthening of the working week. The value we get for the work we do, which 
  is itself a measure of the value capital can extract from us by way of investment, 
  has decreased steadily over the last twenty years of so. The long campaigns 
  of workers to reduce the working week have been halted and reversed. Where capital 
  has never conceded shorter hours to workers ­ for instance in the fast-industrialising 
  Majority World ­ workers are often at their machine for 60-80 hours a week. 
  This accounts for the fact that though wages are absolutely higher than they 
  were yesterday, most people actually are or feel much poorer than before.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">‘Work’ is now something we do throughout our 
  lives. We are no longer ever away from it ­ mobile phones and mobile computers 
  bring ‘work’ to us when we are at leisure, socialising ­ even when we are sleeping. 
  Workers are now on ‘permanent call. Even the unemployed are now engaged in the 
  ‘work’ of ‘looking for work’. And there is an even greater contradiction. Even 
  as the productive capacity of the economy has exploded hugely so that in the 
  1980s it was seriously suggested by some unions that our problem in the 21st 
  century would be filling the ‘leisure time’ that the new automated economy would 
  bring, at the same time ‘work’ has become even more imposed on greater numbers 
  and most ‘work’ is now devoid of any genuine content at all.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="subtitle">WORK TODAY AND FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="2"><i>“The right to work is the right to misery 
    and denies the possibility of the right not to work”</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">What is work? Is the purpose of work to create 
  spiritual and material abundance as the bosses would have us believe, an abundance 
  we all share in according to the contribution we make? Is the purpose of work, 
  through the artificial and mistaken idea of Progress, to end the need for work 
  in favour of leisure for all? Why are such questions important to anarchists? 
  For anarchists, the imposition of work ­ the socially-created need and compulsion 
  to work ­ is a prison we are desperately seeking to escape. We’re not afraid 
  of work but seek to work freely, doing the things that want and need to be done 
  by our own choice and in our own way or, as William Morris famously said, <i>useful 
  work, not useless toil.</i></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>INTENSIFICATION &amp; INSECURITY</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font size="2">“The mass of men live lives of quiet desperation”</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">During the 19<sup>th</sup> Century, workers 
  struggled to defend their right to determine how and when they would work. This 
  was the great age of co-operatives, strikes and political movements led by small 
  artisans defending individual methods of working against the factory system, 
  of Proudhon’s revelation that <i>Property </i>(by which he meant property above 
  the means to sustain a productive life) <i>was theft. </i>Increasingly trapped 
  within the formal economy of jobs and factories as the 20<sup>th</sup> Century 
  progressed, workers without the independent means to live struggled to control 
  the amount of labour they would have to give to the system in order to live. 
  This was the age of the struggle for the eight-hour day, for weekends off, holiday 
  and sickness pay, of a decent wage and guaranteed employment.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The defeat of these struggles, and their containment 
  within capitalism thanks to liberal and union interventions on behalf of the 
  bosses, has reduced the ability of the working class to resist the intensification 
  and casualisation of work, while increasing our dependence on the bosses to 
  obtain the means to live. For some, working time has increased beyond the eight-hour 
  shift into overtime and additional part-time work. In many industries such long 
  hours are compulsory. An employee cannot refuse to do overtime work. In low 
  wage industries workers get overtime work as a favour from managements and union 
  leaders. Companies evade laws requiring premium pay for overtime by calling 
  it 'overstay' or offering ‘hardship allowances' instead of overtime pay. Additionally 
  there has been a huge switch from long-term employment with its often-better 
  pay and conditions to sub-contracting and self-employment (although in many 
  cases the newly self-employed entrepreneur still works for just one company; 
  Network Rail is a case in point). The pressure of competitiveness, which compels 
  bosses to confront workers, has been off-loaded onto the small business sector 
  where weaker regulation allows greater and easier exploitation. Let’s look at 
  an example of how intensification is introduced into the workplace.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2"><i>In 1974 at the Eicher factory in Faridabad 
  450 workers produced 80 tractors per month. Supervisors then drove workers to 
  make 150 tractors in a month. An incentive scheme was introduced in 1978 and 
  workers started producing 500 tractors a month, then 1000 in 1982 and 1500 per 
  month in 1988. In 1989 a re-engineering plan was implemented. The number of 
  workers was halved, though they still had to produce the same number of tractors, 
  and the incentive scheme was discarded. Eicher then used the latest “human resource 
  development” scheme to reduce the number of workers further and goaded them 
  to produce 2000 tractors monthly. At some time incentives were given when a 
  tractor was assembled in 15 minutes. Now it is done in 10 minutes without incentives, 
  and the management wants it done in seven. The unions in the factory have fought 
  the worker’s cause and fought it well: their members are allowed to take all 
  of nine minutes, not seven, to assemble a tractor. Among industrial wage-workers, 
  then, incentives for increased production are often used to make workers supervise 
  intensification of their own bodies. Incentives are meant to lure workers to 
  give more than normal production. The increased levels of production become 
  the new norm - to be met without incentives. Management then begins a new cycle 
  of increasing work-load and intensity.</i></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">A major study from 1999 reported that “the root 
  cause of job insecurity and work intensification lies with the reduced staffing 
  levels pursued by senior managers in response to market pressures from competitors 
  and dominant stakeholders” ­ capitalists, in other words. That same study revealed 
  that 60% of employees in Britain claimed the pace of work and the effort required 
  to do it had greatly increased, resulting in poor general health in the workforce 
  and tense family relationships. Stress and ill-health are made worse by job 
  insecurity. Of course the two are used together to exploit workers more intensively: 
  “if you want to keep your job, worker harder” and “unless you work harder, you 
  will lose your job”. 30% of the workforce work longer than 48 hours a week, 
  with 39% reporting an increase in working hours. Between 2000 and 2002 alone, 
  the number of men working more that 60 hours per week rose from one in eight 
  to one in six. The number of women working long hours has doubled. 50% of workers 
  report inadequate or very inadequate staffing levels and as production and quality 
  suffer, performance appraisal systems are introduced, causing more stress and 
  worry. A major source of job insecurity (which speaks volumes) is the distrust 
  employees have of their bosses: few employees believe their managers have any 
  loyalty towards them. The longer we remain in a state of insecurity the more 
  our physical and mental well-being deteriorates.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>FLEXIBILISATION &amp; CASUALISATION</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Flexibilisation is often presented as the creation 
  of flexible working patterns when it is, in fact, the imposition of a flexible 
  attitude among workers as to who controls our lives. It is also presented as 
  both necessary (to the company’s productivity) and beneficial (to workers) as 
  if the two could ever be compatible. We share in the company’s success only 
  to the extent the bosses allow, and not according to our effort in creating 
  it. Many employees, when asked, have no objection to flexible hours and working 
  but it is the <i>imposition </i>of flexibility that provokes so much discord 
  and rancour. Interestingly (and not surprisingly), those with <i>interesting 
  </i>jobs are greatly in favour of flexible working. For them it means time with 
  their children and a reduction in childcare costs. It means more leisure and 
  quality time. They claim to be able to work <i>smarter </i>and <i>harder. </i>Study 
  after study show, however, that this choice is not open to working class people 
  in dead-end type jobs. Why well-paid and well-rewarded professionals, for instance, 
  need this kind of benefit from their bosses to work hard is not explained. Nor 
  is it explained why such freedom to choose when and how to work has a reverse 
  effect on the ‘lower orders’, for whom long hours, poor pay and the threat of 
  the sack seem to be the only way to get them to work! The working class response 
  to flexibilisation ­ a high labour turnover, absenteeism, low commitment and 
  poor performance ­ is matched by the reduction in benefits, performance management 
  techniques and rigorous monitoring of work and working.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The same applies to casualisation, the process 
  by which the power of employers to give or withhold employment (and with it 
  the means to live). Many bosses are introducing ‘zero hour’ contracts, where 
  there is no guarantee of work and you are permanently on-call. This has the 
  benefit (to the bosses) of the worker not having any rights or protection under 
  the law. The risk associated with the uncertainties of unplanned economies, 
  of having to pay idle workers for instance, is transferred to the workers themselves. 
  So much for the daring entrepreneur who risks all to create wealth for the many! 
  Many millions of jobs have always been or are rapidly becoming casualised. The 
  principles of the free market, where value is entirely subjective, nothing is 
  guaranteed and the devil take the hindmost are being applied to the labour market. 
  And yet, in a society where life <i>is </i>work, doesn’t our failure to have 
  and to hold onto employment condemn us to failure as human beings? Read any 
  tabloid newspaper, listen to any right-wing politician or pundit and the answer 
  is, yes.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">MACDONALDISATION</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="2"><i>“Workers and consumers are the miserable 
    servants of machines and their endless demands”.</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">McDonaldisation (the modern form of Taylorism, 
  though management courses will not mention either word) is a system of producing 
  goods and services in which the process is broken into its smallest part, systematically 
  analysed, re-engineered to maximise profit and replicated in each and every 
  working environment that produces those goods. Making things becomes a series 
  of entirely independent, discrete, controllable actions, eliminating independent 
  thought and creativity.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">We become alienated from the process, required 
  to perform a series of meaningless tasks. Such alienation from the work produces 
  depression, anger, an unthinking and uncaring remoteness from other people.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Everywhere this process is used the bosses are 
  happy with the amount produced but appalled by its low quality. Their only solution 
  is to tightly control and quarantine workers: visit some of the industrial <i>gulags 
  </i>of Indonesia, Malaya or China, for instance. The labour turnover in these 
  factories is evidence of the determination of people to resist their exploitation. 
  The bosses get rid of any worker who shows signs of resistance or who are too 
  demoralised to produce efficiently. Their awareness is a disease that makes 
  them unfit for work or to be around other workers they might infect: with knowledge 
  of, anger towards and contempt for the bosses.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">This system is also often known as Toyotism, 
  after the Toyota, Japan factory system introduced in the 1960s and 1970s. The 
  level of control over workers has been intensified by the introduction of individual 
  work contracts and other processes that impose obligations to produce on the 
  individual while weakening collective agreements and relationships ­ creating 
  what is known in Europe as the ‘diffuse factory’. What is new about Toyotism 
  is &quot;just-in-time&quot; production and prompt reaction to market requirements; 
  the imposition of multi-jobbing on workers employed on several machines, either 
  simultaneously or sequentially; quality control throughout the entire flow of 
  production and real-time information on the progress of production in the factory. 
  Production is often halted and work-teams, departments or even the whole factory 
  called to account. Anybody who shows a waged-worker's indifference to the company's 
  productivity requirements and decides not to join &quot;quality control&quot; 
  groups etc, is stigmatised and encouraged to leave.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The same system is applied to the commodities 
  that are used in the process with every stage of how they are produced and processed 
  minutely regulated. A cow is not a living creature but a sack of usable and 
  unusable meat, fat and gristle. How the useful is divided from the not-so useful 
  is a science in itself. Increasingly consumption and leisure are being ‘McDonaldised’. 
  The places where we seek pleasure are increasingly the same, we expect to be 
  able to find the same brand names throughout the world. We laugh at the same 
  time and at the same jokes. Culture is increasingly global but it also increasingly 
  mass-manufactured and distributed, designed for mass appeal, consumed not created, 
  a thing that is done to us, doled out in pieces to audiences that are happy 
  to feed for awhile instead of thinking.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>COMMODIFICATION</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="2">Work used to be a purposeful and meaningful 
  activity. There was spiritual satisfaction in working and co-operating to meet 
  the needs of ourselves, our families, our people. People chose the work they 
  did if they could and invested much of their personality and abilities in the 
  making and production of useful, better or beautiful things. Today, the pre-eminence 
  of consumption as a social good and conferrer of social status on us as individuals 
  has made the product far more important than the producer (witness the social 
  cachet of a Nike trainer over the sweated Indonesian who made it). Work has 
  ceased to have a personal value for those who toil. In many cases it does not 
  have a social value to society (witness the amount we discard or the sheer quantity 
  of junk goods we produce). Large amounts of work is simply about the reproduction 
  of capitalism on a daily basis ­ think about the trillions of dollars traded 
  on the stock markets for instance and why it is being done. It matters only 
  because this is the means by which capitalism justifies itself and produces 
  the means ­ money ­ for its own continuation. The activity produces nothing, 
  except money, whose social value is zero. Work only matters in terms of what 
  is produced ­ the commodity - and the social and personal value of what is produced 
  to the person consuming it. If you don’t believe us, why are so many important 
  jobs like nursing rewarded so badly? Our labour, the portion of time we spend 
  being ‘socially useful’ has become a commodity, whose value in the market is 
  dictated solely by the whims of millions of other individual desires to possess, 
  stimulated by the propaganda mills of capitalism, the advertising industry. 
  Of course, many people realise this but are themselves trapped by the artificial 
  need and desire to consume. We become our own gaoler! It is through consumption 
  that the majority channel their aspirations ­ to pleasure, to a sense of meaning 
  and personal identity. Our aspirations to freedom have been transferred from 
  the workplace to the rest of our lives but the commodification of personal life 
  and leisure has simply built more cares around our life. The refusal to work 
  must be accompanied by the refusal to consume (and vice versa), to participate 
  in the reproduction of everyday life through the production and consumption 
  of useless commodities via a commodified process: work.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="subtitle">ARGUMENTS AGAINST WORK</p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>WAGE SLAVERY</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font size="2">“Labour only sustains life by stunting 
    it. Tell me how much you work and I'll tell you what you are”.</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">When wage-slavery began, and primarily men were 
  drafted into the ranks of wage-slaves, wage-work was portrayed by the merchant 
  and industrial classes as an emancipation from feudal bondage. Over the course 
  of the 19<sup>th</sup> and 20<sup>th</sup> Centuries, many women started doing 
  piecework at home and some began leaving home to take paid employment. Many 
  reasons are suggested for this: war-created need for additional labour, movements 
  of female emancipation, greater social aspiration and mobility, the decay of 
  patriarchal culture. What is usually not talked about is the reduction in the 
  value of wages offered to men throughout this period, which turned women into 
  wage-workers. Women's opposition to patriarchal norms and their compulsion to 
  take up wage-work have led many people argue that work outside the home is a 
  liberating and rewarding experience for women, one that allows them to fully 
  develop their intellectual and human potential, a liberation from domestic drudgery. 
  But wage work in factories or workshops, in clerical positions, in schools &amp; 
  laboratories, in production or in retail stores involves regimentation, repetition, 
  physical burdens and spiritual turmoil that are hardly liberating, creative, 
  or fulfilling.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">For working class women and men work is neither 
  joyful nor creative. Wage-work is meaningless. Jobs are boring and repetitious, 
  they provide no intellectual or spiritual rewards and provide no satisfaction. 
  The severe regimentation of factory life, which now pervades all spheres of 
  life, destroys vitality and intelligence. It is not paid work but rather free 
  moments away from jobs and housework that give meaning to life. Labour, and 
  how it is organised by the bosses, underpins contemporary relationships among 
  people on every level of experience: whether in terms of the rewards it brings, 
  the privileges it confers, the discipline it demands, the repression it produces 
  or the social conflicts it generates.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>COMPULSION AND DEGRADATION</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font size="2">“In a ton of work, there's not an ounce 
    of love”</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The early factory introduced no sweeping technological 
  advances more important than the abstraction, rationalization and objectification 
  of labour, and its embodiment in human beings. The factory was not born from 
  a need to integrate labour with modern machinery. It arose from a need to rationalise 
  the labour process, to intensify and exploit it more effectively. The initial 
  goal of the factory was to dominate labour and to destroy the worker’s independence 
  from capital.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">And what of the post-Fordist future? Technologies 
  already present will restructure and stratify work, dividing labour power into 
  a relatively restricted upper level of the super-skilled, and a massive lower 
  level of ordinary doers and executors. It will continue to separate and divides 
  labour power hierarchically and spatially and break the framework of collective 
  bargaining. The process of accumulation will become more intense, and it is 
  possible there will be a long period of capitalism without opposition: turbo-capitalism, 
  marked by an unusual political stability. The post-Fordist worker will be an 
  individual who is atomised, flexibilised, increasingly non-union, kept on low 
  wages and inescapably in jobs that are always precarious. The state will no 
  longer guarantee to cover the material costs of the reproduction of labour power 
  and will further act to limit consumption. The majority sector of the non-privileged 
  will be forced to cut back on its standard of living in order to survive. This 
  may lead to resistance and the resurrection of traditional forms of organisation 
  and collective action. We certainly hope so. For without it, the future for 
  humanity as individual, thinking beings prompted by internal desires and needs 
  and not artificially-created compulsions to work and consume (or not), is bleak 
  indeed.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Anarchists desire to see humanity liberate itself 
  from work, if by liberation we mean self-government. As well as hierarchy, the 
  workplace created by power structures also helps to undermine our abilities. 
  As Bob Black argues:</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">&quot;You are what you do. If you do boring, 
  stupid, monotonous work, chances are you'll end up boring, stupid, and monotonous. 
  Work is a much better explanation for the creeping cretinization all around 
  us than even such significant moronizing mechanisms as television and education. 
  People who are regimented all their lives, handed to work from school and bracketed 
  by the family in the beginning and the nursing home in the end, are habituated 
  to hierarchy and psychologically enslaved. Their aptitude for autonomy is so 
  atrophied that their fear of freedom is among their few rationally grounded 
  phobias. Their obedience training at work carries over into the families they 
  start, thus reproducing the system in more ways than one, and into politics, 
  culture and everything else. Once you drain the vitality from people at work, 
  they'll likely submit to hierarchy and expertise in everything. They're used 
  to it.&quot;</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Historians and politicians ask us to accept 
  that the productive advances unleashed by the factory system were worth the 
  price of our spiritual degradation. The idea of ‘The End of History’ is built 
  upon the notion that humanity has lost the ability to create new social relations 
  and will remain largely content to remain ­ for ever ­ trapped in a liberal, 
  bourgeois and capitalist society of abundance. Capitalism’s aim, because it 
  fears the liberatory potential of the working class, is to continue the process 
  of degradation until we are unable to resist. It seeks to create essentially 
  inorganic beings, spiritually dead automatons. Insanity, irrationalism, alienation, 
  anomie, the inability to empathise, to be more than functionally creative, the 
  routinisation of exploration and adventure, these are symptoms of a deep and 
  invidious illness deep in humanity’s soul which capitalism has spread amongst 
  us.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">This attempt to change the fundamental nature 
  of humanity, and to enslave us, does not just occur in the workplace but exists 
  at all levels of modern ‘civilisation’. Mass production and the compulsion to 
  work is made possible only by vast bureaucracies, authoritarian ‘mega-machines’ 
  of socialisation, investigation, compulsion, control and sanction. Capitalism 
  reduces the worker to a mere machine operator, following the orders of his or 
  her boss. And entirely soulless mass-produced objects create mechanically deadened 
  people. It has created a constant process of alienated consumption, as workers 
  try to find the happiness associated with productive, creative, self-managed 
  activity in a place it does not exist ­ the shopping mall or retail precinct.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">To reverse this, we must re-conquer everyday 
  life by destroying the state. Liberating technologies presuppose liberating 
  institutions. The forms of resistance are as widespread and diverse as the means 
  of control. In the factory, strikes, sabotage, work stoppages. In the community 
  truancy, vandalism, protest, direct action, arson. And there are also positive 
  actions as well. Acts of sabotage or work refusal (by phoning in sick, for instance) 
  are rarely individual acts but collective ones, approved of and assisted by 
  fellow workers. If the rule is silence, we communicate. If the command is speed 
  up, we slow down. Resistance creates zones of freedom that we can extend and 
  make permanent, creating within them the institutions ­ the claimant’s union, 
  the rank-and-file workers group, the direct action campaign ­ that are the seeds 
  of future liberation.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="subtitle"><font SIZE="5">RESISTANCE IN THE WORKPLACE</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Here’s just some of the wonderfully inventive 
  ways workers have found to defy the bosses and take back a little ­ in time, 
  dignity and self-respect ­ that the bosses try to steal using the need for money 
  to live.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>WORK TO RULE</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Every industry is covered by a mass of rules, 
  regulations and agreed working practices, many of them archaic. If applied strictly 
  they can make production difficult if not impossible. Many of these rules exist 
  in any case to protect management in the event of industrial accidents. They 
  are quite prepared to close their eyes when these rules are broken in the interests 
  of keeping production going. Even a modest overtime ban can be effective, if 
  applied intelligently; it is particularly effective in industries with uneven 
  work patterns. Here’s just one example of a work to rule in practice ­ an effective 
  tactic with little chance the bosses can do anything about it except suffer: 
  <i>When, under nationalisation, strikes [on the French railways] were forbidden, 
  their syndicalist fellow-workers urged the railmen to carry out the strict letter 
  of the law... One law tells the engine driver to make sure of the safety of 
  any bridge over which his train has to pass. If after personal examination, 
  he is still doubtful, then he must consult the other members of the train crew. 
  Of course trains run late! Another law for which French railwaymen developed 
  a sudden passion related to the ticket collectors. All tickets had to be carefully 
  examined on both sides. The law said nothing about city rush hours!</i></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>GO SLOW</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="2">This is a very effective tactic where various 
  industrial processes depend one upon the other and both supply and distribution 
  are geared to continuous, steady rates of production, such as in the automotive 
  or food packing industries. Here’s one example of a go-slow (which is an increasingly 
  common tactic in the sweatshop factories of the developing world) from Fords 
  at Dagenham, at the time one of the biggest car assemblers in the world: <i>The 
  company stated that the headliners had repeatedly refused to fit more than 13 
  heads in any one shift, saying that the management's request was unreasonable. 
  Yet “they had in fact fitted each headlining in less time than allowed, and 
  spent the remainder of the time between jobs sitting down. They took so long 
  over each car that they prevented other employees on the line from performing 
  their operations thus causing congestion and frequently leading to the lines 
  being stopped and sometimes other employees being sent home. Shop stewards however, 
  supported by the convener, had always maintained on these occasions that the 
  employees concerned were working normally and refused completely, in spite of 
  numerous appeals, to persuade their members to remove restrictions”.</i></font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>GOOD WORK</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font SIZE="2">One of the serious problems facing militants 
  in general and workers in the service industries in particular is that they 
  can end up hurting the consumers (mostly fellow workers) more than the boss. 
  This isolates them from the general mass of the population, which enables the 
  authorities to whip up 'public opinion' against the strikers. One way round 
  this problem is to consider techniques which selectively hurt the boss without 
  affecting other workers - or better still are to the advantage of the public. 
  The 'good work' strike is a general term which means that workers provide consumers 
  with better service or products than the employer intended. One good side-effect 
  of the good work strike is that it places the onus of stopping a service on 
  the employer. Even if ‘good work’ leads to a lock-out of workers by the boss, 
  service-users would still blame the employer rather than the worker. And lock-outs 
  can be avoided by ‘wildcat’ good working: suddenly, without notice, and for 
  limited periods - repeated at intervals until the bosses cave in. In New York 
  City restaurant workers, after losing a strike, won some of their demands by 
  heeding the advice of organisers to &quot;pile up the plates, give 'em double 
  helpings&quot; and figure bills on the lower side. You can imagine similar situations 
  in other industries, for instance postal workers behind a counter only accepting 
  unstamped letters or people working checkouts refusing to work the tills. Here’s 
  a final example: <i>Lisbon bus and train workers gave free rides to all passengers. 
  They were protesting because the British-owned Lisbon Tramways Company had not 
  raised their wages. Today conductors and tram drivers arrived at work as usual, 
  but the conductors did not pick up their money satchels. On the whole the public 
  seems to be on the side of these take-no-fare strikers</i>.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>OPEN MOUTH</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Sometimes telling people the simple truth about 
  what goes on at work can put a lot of pressure on the boss. Consumer industries 
  (restaurants, packing plants, hospitals and the like) are the most vulnerable. 
  There is not a lot the bosses can do about ‘open mouth’ action other than improving 
  conditions. There is nothing illegal about it, so the police cannot be called 
  in. It also strikes at the fraudulent practices which business for profit is 
  based on. Commerce today is founded on fraud. Capitalism's standards of honesty 
  demand that the worker lies to everybody except the boss. In the food industry 
  workers, instead of striking, or when on strike, can expose the way food is 
  prepared for sale. In restaurants, cooks can tell what kinds of food they are 
  expected to cook, how stale foods are treated so they can be served up. Dishwashers 
  can expose how 'well' dishes are washed. Construction and factory workers can 
  alert newspapers and health and safety inspectors to the shoddy materials being 
  used or cheating on safety regulations. Workers in public transport can tell 
  of faulty engines, brakes, and repairs.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>THE SICK IN</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The sick-in is a way to strike without striking. 
  The idea is to cripple your workplace by having all or most of the workforce 
  call in sick on the same day or days. Unlike the formal walk-out, it can be 
  used effectively by departments and work areas instead of the whole workplace, 
  and because its usually informal can succeed even where no union exists to organise 
  it. At certain times, just the hint of ‘flu doing the rounds’ and the likelihood 
  of it spreading to important areas of work can work wonders with a stubborn 
  boss or supervisor. Even workers contacting the personnel office to see how 
  much sick time they have available can send a powerful message.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>TAKING CHARGE OF WORK</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Sometimes the way to get what you want is to 
  take it. This requires better and stronger organisation than any other direct 
  action method but is also a powerful weapon in the worker’s arsenal. When workers 
  decide that they are going to do what they want to do, instead of what the employers 
  want them to do, there is not a lot the employers can do about it. There have 
  been many examples of this taking place, from timber-felling in the USA, the 
  heavy industries of Italy and South America and the automotive factories of 
  USA, Britain and Europe. Here’s an example: <i>A strong IWW Marine Transport 
  Workers Union existed on trans-Atlantic shipping out of the port of Boston. 
  One of the main grievances of the workers on these ships was the quality of 
  the food served aboard ship. Acceptable menus were decided upon and published 
  by the Union. The cooks and stewards, being good union members, refused to cook 
  anything except what was on the menus - to the satisfaction of everyone except 
  the bosses. </i>But because work is often made up of a series of activities, 
  involving different kinds of workers, it must be carefully co-ordinated and 
  there must be high levels of solidarity between workers. This often requires 
  there to be a strong union which can become just as much a ‘manager’ of shit 
  work as it is the protector of liberated work.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>OCCUPATIONS AND SIT INS</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Sit-Ins are relatively restricted and passive 
  and are similar to ‘go-slows’ and ‘slow-downs’, only with a clear physical expression 
  ­ people stop work and sit down. Occupations are more positive actions, actually 
  to take over a plant and deny access to the management. The latter needs a high 
  level of militancy and solidarity, as well as good rank-and-file organisation. 
  Unity of purpose is essential for a successful Sit-In. While there is a fairly 
  long record of sit-ins in Britain there have been few large-scale factory occupations 
  such as are common in both France and Italy. Occupations require a high level 
  of militancy and organisation on the part of the workers concerned. It is doomed 
  if the factory remains isolated from the rest of organised labour, the working 
  class and community generally but in the right conditions, it can be dynamite. 
  What is needed is mass involvement. Workers should not be presented with a plan: 
  an effective occupation must be preceded by departmental and mass meetings to 
  plan the occupation, and lots of propaganda.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>SABOTAGE</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Workers and the work they do are a commodity, 
  to be bought and sold like everything else. And in the marketplace, a low price 
  often means shoddy goods. Why shouldn’t the same rule apply for workers? For 
  low pay and bad working conditions, inefficient work. Working class sabotage 
  is used more often than you would think. Although often used by frustrated individuals, 
  it is most effective - like all direct action tactics - when all or most of 
  the workers on a job are in on it. Here’s an example: <i>When [the line] got 
  over sixty, say, someone would just accidentally drop a bolt in the line and 
  as soon as it worked its way round to the end, bang, the line would stop. Then 
  there would be a delay and everybody would take their break</i>. The same sort 
  of thing goes on in every industry: neglecting to maintain or lubricate machinery 
  at the correct intervals, punching buttons on complicated electronic gear in 
  the wrong order, putting pieces in the wrong way, running machines at the wrong 
  speeds or feeds, dropping foreign bodies in gear boxes, 'technological indiscipline': 
  each industry and trade has its established practices, its own traditions.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>THE STRIKE</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Even the traditional unofficial walkout can 
  be made much more effective than it normally is. The participation of the ordinary 
  worker is often limited to attending the occasional mass meeting. They then 
  stay at home, in isolation, watching the progress of their own dispute on the 
  TV. Bosses have got wise to this tactic, and governments have begun to threaten 
  unions with sequestration and deny hardship benefits to striking workers. Workers 
  have responded with ‘guerilla’ strikes, involving different workers and without 
  any fixed pattern minimise the cost of strikes to the workers yet maximise their 
  disruptive effect. There is the chessboard strike, where every other department 
  stops. The brushfire or articulated strike, which, over a period, rolls through 
  every key section of a works. The pay-book strike, where every worker whose 
  payroll number is odd goes on strike on certain days, with even numbers on strike 
  on the other days. And strikes where blue-collar workers down tools in the morning 
  but return after lunch, only to find that the white-collar workers and foremen 
  are now out, making all work impossible thus achieving a full day's stoppage 
  for only half a day's loss of pay.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>INFORMAL RESISTANCE</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">One of the greatest unsung stories of the industrial 
  working class is that of resistance at the point of production. Work is so unpleasant 
  that it is not surprising it is resented. Informal resistance- in the form of 
  piecework ceilings, agreements among workers as to what constitutes a fair day's 
  work and the refusal by workers to participate in their own exploitation - is 
  what makes the difference between potential and actual production. Informal 
  resistance and its effect on ‘productivity’, explains the steady and massive 
  expansion of work-study, job evaluation, quality control, inspection, etc. Management 
  also tries to solve this problem by introducing 'workers participation', to 
  motivate their employees to identify with the interests of the company. In the 
  long term all these measures will fail, as the basic problem, boring, unpleasant 
  and often dangerous work, will not be removed.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY" class="subtitle">WORK IN THE FREE SOCIETY</p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font size="2">Freedom begins where work ends</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The ideology of work has begun to be challenged 
  by recent changes in capitalism itself, by chronic mass unemployment and under-employment, 
  the phenomenon of temporary and casual work, short-term contracts and flexibility. 
  The notion of a job for life has become a thing of the past for most working 
  people outside the so-called professions. Work is transitory, fragmented and 
  periods of unemployment regarded as a natural condition. Many young working 
  class people have never experienced the ‘dignity’ that labour is supposed to 
  bestow and those who have never known the ‘world of work’ feel little guilt 
  in not being part of it. Work as the basis for the way capitalism integrates 
  people into society in order to control them is being undermined by chronic 
  global economic crises caused by the radical restructuring of national economies 
  in the search for profit (World Bank, WTO, Doha et al) and new technologies 
  which are making certain classes of workers entirely redundant.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Where does this leave libertarian revolutionaries 
  and our vision of social change? Will our arguments for a society without ‘employment’, 
  without bosses and wage labour, make more sense to working class people for 
  whom work has already become an unendurable means to an end, and for whom work 
  has little meaning? Is there the possibility that a weakening of workers’ identification 
  with their ‘occupation’ will bring about a weakening of their identification 
  with the status quo? Or maybe the atomisation of large sections of the working 
  class by the capitalism’s continuing development will cause a further decrease 
  in class consciousness? Whatever the consequences of the decline of the work 
  ethic and ideology, it is certain that wage labour will remain an alienated 
  and alienating experience for those who are forced to take part in it and the 
  exploitation inherent within work under capitalism will not go away.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The only solution is to reclaim for ourselves 
  the right to work when we want to, doing what we want to do, when we want to 
  do it, or to not work at all! But this emancipation from the crushing coils 
  of wage slavery may meet an individual need for freedom but does nothing to 
  end the destructive and malign institution that is capitalism today. After all, 
  there are plenty more potential wage slaves where you come from! No, liberation 
  from work must be a collective, global act, involving millions upon millions 
  of toiling people, people who for a day, a week, a month or however long it 
  takes, refuse to work and begin destroying the means by which capitalism makes 
  us work.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b><font size="2">This general and social strike is our aim, 
  the refusal of work by all working people, for all time. It will be, we hope, 
  a gentle insurrection, a welling up of anger and despair and the creation of 
  a stubborn and unstoppable desire for freedom. We will take our hands from the 
  plough and the loom, rise up from our desks, cast off our boots and overalls, 
  walk out of the hotels and restaurants, leave the factory and office, meeting 
  with others to join in their refusal to work as they celebrate ours.</font></b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">And if this is a global act, how can the capitalist 
  class resist us? We know how to live with nothing, do they? The working people 
  of the world get by with no money and little food, without power and water for 
  weeks on end, without servants or holidays or chauffeurs. We don’t need them. 
  They need us, to work. And if we refuse to work, they have no power to compel 
  us. And so, we mustn’t strike for this or that, for 5% here or 10% there, things 
  that be granted today and taken back tomorrow. Our refusal to work must be for 
  freedom from work, and that alone, for freedom, once taken, can never be reclaimed.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Once capitalism has been destroyed, we can set 
  about the exciting task of fulfilling our individual potential and shaping this 
  new community. Of course, in a world that may have been disrupted by the process 
  of revolutionary war, we will first need to ensure that we can feed and shelter 
  everyone. This need not be the brutal task the counter-revolutionaries try to 
  scare us with. In the world there are more than enough buildings and food to 
  provide for everyone. What matters, of course, is to distribute these fairly, 
  using newly seized communications such as radio stations, roads and railways.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Capitalism creates a culture in which it is 
  a virtue to work, to strive to outdo or overcome, to contribute on society’s 
  terms. We fight against the false logic of capitalist thought, which uses concepts 
  as 'Progress', 'Growth', and 'Development' to justify its compulsion of people 
  (by open and more subtle means) to work and work harder. The economic system 
  is not something that should hurtle out of control but must, like technology, 
  be subordinated to human need. This leads us to question the work ethic and 
  the nature of work ­ so we wrote this pamphlet. The revolution will fundamentally 
  transform the nature of work. Where we live and work will be considerably altered. 
  We will re-organise industry so that we only produce what is socially useful. 
  We will introduce the ecological management of production and consumption, balancing 
  the needs of society against the desires of its members. And in doing this we 
  will massively reduce the amount of work that must be done to sustain society, 
  work that itself will be freely chosen, increasing the time available to us 
  for all the other things that make living worthwhile.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>VOLUNTARISM</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Work will be a voluntary act, a personal choice 
  to work or not to work, to work now or later, to work hard or slowly or carefully, 
  with our hands or our minds or both. Because the meaning of work lies within 
  the personal benefit to ourselves and the social benefit to others, it must 
  be freely chosen. Nothing in society will compel us to do work we do not want 
  to do in ways we find wrong or alien to ourselves. Nor will there be any incentives 
  to do this or that work. There will, for instance, be no more prestige or status 
  attached to one social function compared to another and where a person can do 
  the work, there will be no artificial barrier (a union card, a qualification, 
  a tribal affiliation, a greased palm) to doing it. With this freedom comes a 
  generalised responsibility to ensure society maintains itself. If the free society 
  is generally beneficial to all, we will want to keep it going. We will need 
  to develop a sense of what needs to be done and whether and how we can contribute 
  to that aim. In part that will come, as it does now, from education and socialisation, 
  the millions of interactions we have with our fellow human beings that shape 
  who we are and define what we want to do with our lives. But the key part in 
  all this will be ourselves, our social conscience, our sense of what is best 
  for both our society and ourselves. The measure of our society and its worth 
  to humanity will be the extent to which what needs to be done <i>is </i>done, 
  by free choice and without compulsion and the pleasure humanity gets in the 
  doing of it.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>CO-OPERATION</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">As revolutionaries we argue for egalitarian 
  structures accountable and accessible to all. It seems most likely that these 
  structures will emerge from the workers and community councils that the working 
  class create during the Revolution. We also foresee that a federal structure 
  will emerge globally to co-ordinate such things as the production and distribution 
  of resources, determining the kinds of things that need to be done and how to 
  get them done, with decisions being taken at the lowest appropriate level: the 
  individual worker, the small craft shop, the neighbourhood, the town, industry 
  or region and so on. Agriculture and industry will be undertaken by communities 
  that are part of local and global networks distributing their produce.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>PERSONAL CHOICE</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Specific examples of changed social relations 
  will serve to show what we mean by social revolution. No human being will be 
  prepared or compelled to do particular kinds of work. People may choose to continue 
  a tradition of particular kinds of work, going into the same kinds of work as 
  their peers (on the one hand) or may choose an esoteric form of work they spend 
  their whole life learning how to do. Women will not have the maintenance of 
  the home and child-rearing as their major social function, because such tasks 
  will be the responsibility of the whole community. Children will do the work 
  they can and want to do (and also have time for education and leisure) as soon 
  as they can.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">It is a fundamental belief of anarchist communists 
  that the working class already have the skills needed to run society. Not everyone 
  has all of these, of course, and equality does not mean that we all take it 
  in turns to perform heart surgery! Some specialisation will be necessary. We 
  will work as we want, so long as the thing we are doing at the time meets our 
  personal and social needs. If you want to work long and hard at a particular 
  task you are free to do so, gaining the fulfilment such action brings. If you 
  wish to work a bit here, then play, then work again at something else, changing 
  jobs as you like, travelling to different places to do it, working with different 
  people as your mood determines, then do it.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">The only lesson society will teach its members 
  is that there are times to work and to rest, to labour and to play, to work 
  hard or a little, to do what needs to be done sometimes and what we want to 
  do a lot, to use our hands or our brains or both as needed, to find the value 
  in every activity and to have enjoyed the doing and the not-doing in equal measure.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>PRODUCTIVE WORK</b></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Work will be more enjoyable because, unlike 
  capitalism, it will have a point to it and because we will work in ways that 
  maximise fulfilment, not profit. Less pleasant but none the less necessary tasks 
  will be shared out entirely equally and the rest of our time can be spent in 
  enjoyable and creative pursuits. Of course, fields will have to be ploughed, 
  drains cleaned and domestic work performed, but no one will be 'a farm labourer', 
  a 'sewage worker' or 'a housewife', because these task will be shared out equally 
  and performed in collectively run farms, workplaces, launderettes and crèches 
  etc, and occupy the minimum of time for each person (unless they like doing 
  them!). In addition, these tasks will no longer be performed for a boss, a council 
  bureaucracy or a husband, because we will not be answerable to any more powerful 
  individual but to our anarchist communist society, i.e. each other.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Don’t get us wrong: we are not <i>stakhanovites 
  </i>who endlessly extol the pleasure and virtues of toil! If the free society 
  of the future can only be sustained by long hours of drudgery and the self-abasement 
  of the people to the god ‘production’, we want none of it. But we know, because 
  it has been proven over and over again, that the amount of <i>necessary</i> 
  work that will be shared amongst those people able to do it amounts to no more 
  than 2-3 hours, leaving the rest of the day for play, creativity, sex, idleness, 
  socialising, recreation, study, whatever we want.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><b>THE PLEASURE OF WORK: THE WORK OF PLEASURE</b></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><font size="2"><i>The liberation of work can only come about 
    with the liberation from work, from the capitalist reduction of life to work</i></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Most work under capitalism is mindless and pointless, 
  unless you are a boss. All activity after the Revolution will take place not 
  for profit or the maintenance of the status quo, as it does now, but for the 
  fulfilment of the individual, although never to the detriment of society. There 
  will be no place for useless work such as the production of consumer goods for 
  profit or the maintenance of social control because these 'normal' aspects of 
  society will be irrelevant after the Revolution. Each person will therefore 
  have more time on their hands, but this is fundamentally different to 'unemployment' 
  because no one will be 'employed'. Productive activity is an important way of 
  developing our inner-powers and expressing ourselves, in other words being creative. 
  As Alexander Berkman argues:</font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><i><font size="2">&quot;We do not live by bread alone. True, 
    existence is not possible without opportunity to satisfy our physical needs. 
    But the gratification of these by no means constitutes all of life. In a sensible 
    society…….. [t]he feelings of human sympathy, of justice and right would have 
    a chance to develop, to be satisfied, to broaden and grow.&quot;</font></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Anarchists desire to change the nature of both 
  work and life and create a society based upon freedom in all aspects of life. 
  In the free society, the contribution a person makes to society or the social 
  value of work will not be measured in economic terms as it is under capitalism. 
  <b><u>It will not be measured at all</u>.</b> What matters is that each individual 
  feels that the work they do is personally fulfilling. If it makes a positive 
  contribution to society as well, this is a bonus for us and you.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">Work will become, primarily, the expression 
  of a person's pleasure in what they are doing and become like an art - an expression 
  of their creativity and individuality. Work as an art will become expressed 
  in the workplace as well as the work process, with workplaces transformed and 
  integrated into the local community and environment.</font></p>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font size="2">We hope that this short pamphlet about explains 
  why anarchists want to abolish work and seek to escape the imposition of work 
  upon us and upon the toiling millions of the earth. We also hope that it leads 
  you to begin to question your own involvement in the world of work and stimulate 
  a desire to work for the liberation of those millions. The future will decide 
  upon the nature of work in the future, of work as a creative, liberating, productive 
  and fulfilling activity. To us falls the task of breaking our chains. What our 
  children make from them is their work and the only work that will matter in 
  the free society of our future.</font></p>
