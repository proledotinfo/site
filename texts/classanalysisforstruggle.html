<p class="title">Class Analysis, for Anti-Capitalist Struggle</p>
<p>This article is an attempt at communication with individuals and groups involved 
  in subversive activity. The background of all present radical struggles is an 
  attack on the social relation of capital, whether or not this is realised by 
  the participants. The destruction of modern global conditions implies a global 
  struggle; the only terrain on which a world-wide struggle can be fought is one 
  which centres on a global class. The success of all or any of the partial struggles 
  now being fought (over wages, squatting, environmental defence, work refusal 
  etc.) means an extension and integration of proletarian struggle. An understanding 
  of class relationships, although useless on its own, can lead to a greater effectiveness 
  of our own struggles. This analysis has been developed out of practical experience. 
  It is hoped that it may have practical results, that it is not theory separate 
  from practise.</p>
<p> I have found that apparently minor disagreements on class analysis (such as 
  whether teachers are middle class or working class) can turn out after much 
  discussion to rely on very basic disagreements as to how the world is. In particular, 
  disagreements on the nature of truth. Therefore it is necessary to start at 
  a very basic level. My own understanding of the world is materialist. But I 
  don't plan to waste much time arguing materialism versus idealism. The opposing 
  world views are so far apart that there is no common ground to argue from. I 
  will state though that the world is made and remade by material forces not by 
  ideas. For instance, it may be or may not be the case that your ideas change 
  after reading this. But any such change would be totally irrelevant if your 
  actions, your behaviour do not change as well. In any case, ideas are not changed 
  merely by the reading of some article, but in the context of some wider experience. 
  If that were not the case then everyone reading the same stuff would end up 
  thinking the same thing, which certainly isn't what happens.
<p class="subtitle">Where is your truth, when god is dead? 
<p> In some societies such as Europe in Medieval Times, and perhaps in some modern 
  theocracies, it was the case that truth was something that appeared to come 
  from outside of society. Certain important disputes were argued out and decided 
  upon according to a fixed official truth. In Medieval Europe the fixed truth 
  was the scriptures. The particular interpretation of the "fixed truth" might 
  in fact be determined according to interests of the most powerful groups in 
  society, but it was nevertheless the case that there existed some reference 
  point around which important disputes would turn. In particular, revolutionary 
  class struggles in the Middle Ages seemed always to have religious disagreements 
  that corresponded to the opposing class forces. (For instance, the Muenster 
  commune was created by Anabaptists, the Taborites were also protestants who 
  fought against the established church, and the various class forces in the English 
  civil war also had their own religious sects.)
<p> This state of affairs was smashed by the bourgeois revolution. God was ripped 
  from the centre of society leaving a vacuum that cannot be filled by a constantly 
  developing science. With no generally accepted truth, new opposing truths are 
  developed by contradictory sections of society. Nowhere is this more obviously 
  so than in the area of class theory. 
<p> One current capitalist version of class theory is based on sociology. With 
  this method, society is categorised according to type of occupation, education, 
  and salary. In one variant, skilled workers are categorised as C2's, for example. 
  This class analysis is used most especially by the advertising industry. In 
  order to maximise sales, advertising is aimed at particular groups. More interestingly, 
  this type of analysis is also used by political parties in order to maximise 
  the efficiency of their campaigning. In Britain, the C2's are seen by most political 
  pundits as a crucial territory on which to fight. People lower down the scale 
  might have a tendency to vote Labour, those higher up Conservative. Skilled 
  workers are a significant group where careful campaigning and policy making 
  can tip the scales one way or the other. The Conservative policies of selling 
  off council houses, mortgage relief and of widespread share issues, were deliberately 
  aimed at this group. Their use of the sociological class analysis has been crucial 
  to their continued grip on power. This theory is therefore certainly true; it 
  corresponds in an exact way with the real world. But it is only true for capitalist 
  forces. It corresponds to their worldview, it is useful for them to plan their 
  strategies against us. It is true, but true only for the capitalist class in 
  the maintenance of its power. We need class theory for an entirely different 
  reason. We wish to understand this society in order to destroy it. Therefore 
  our theory must be based not on the scientific notion of categorising differentiable 
  strata, but instead on the active relationship of different groups, with each 
  other, and with capitalism and the struggle against it.
<p class="subtitle">Class in History</p>
<p> Every civilised society has been a class society. Each of these societies 
  has based its civilisation, its culture, its technology, on the oppression of 
  the majority by a minority. The earliest civilisations were based on open class 
  power. The main productive class were the slaves, who originally were kidnapped 
  from free communities or rival civilised societies. Over time, the master slave 
  relationship became accepted by both parties as normal, and the slaves participated 
  in the reproduction of their slavery. 
<p>
 In more recent times, the place of the slave class was taken by that of the peasant.  The peasants lived in their own village communities.  But these communities were not the free communities that existed before (or outside of)  civilisation.  The communities were dominated by the power of the lord, the church, and eventually the state.  These forces were external to the agrarian community but none the less played an important role within it.  The lord was the protector of the community (providing a form of protection that is usually associated with organised crime), the peasants worked perhaps one day a week on his lands in return for his care.  This relationship, also tended to become accepted, and both lord and peasant recognised a system of complementary rights and duties.<p>

<p> Previous historical societies had class relationships that were very different 
  from today's. But these relationships are also recognisable. Workers are often 
  referred to as wage-slaves, and although, workers are not bought and sold, but 
  are legally free, this phrase has some obvious reality to it. How do we relate 
  our own class oppression to the class oppression of our ancestors? What is the 
  common factor in all systems of class domination? The answer, which is both 
  obvious and commonly denied is the existence of social power. In all class societies, 
  the members of the lowest class have their power alienated from them in one 
  way or another. This alienated power is wielded by the ruling class and their 
  functionaries. In ancient societies, the power of the slave was alienated absolutely, 
  so that the slave was an object, a simple commodity to be bought and sold, a 
  dog to be kicked. The peasant on the other hand, was allowed a measure of social 
  autonomy, within strict limits. Today the alienated power of the majority is 
  wielded especially by the functionaries of capital and by the agents of state 
  and spectacle. This use of alienated social power is an active relationship 
  with those it is used against.
<p class="subtitle">"Marxism"
<p> The society we live in is capitalist, characterised by wage labour, a centralised 
  state, commodity production, the accumulation of capital. Can we still talk 
  of class being determined by power in this society? The first "coherent" class 
  analysis I came across was a Trotskyist version, touted by the Workers Revolutionary 
  Party, the then official British section of the 4th International. The class 
  theory they put across was that class position is determined by whether or not 
  a person owned capital. Those that owned a large amount are the bourgeoisie, 
  those who own a small amount, petty bourgeois, the rest of us working class. 
  This theory (which is held by many more or less marxist groups) obviously has 
  a lot going for it. Ownership of capital definitely is important in capitalist 
  society! But the theory also has serious flaws in it. The biggest problem was 
  revealed by the WRP's analysis of the Soviet Union. The USSR had all the typical 
  social relations of capitalism; wage-labour, commodity production, etc. However 
  it did not have a class of people who owned capital. The position of the WRP 
  was therefore that the USSR did not have a capitalist class and was a form of 
  worker's state. The idiocy of this position does not come from the WRP misusing 
  the theory, but from the theory itself. A class analysis that looks only at 
  whether individuals own capital or not to determine their class position, is 
  worse than useless. It provides a theoretical justification for supporting particular 
  states which are in every way capitalist. It fails to locate the real fault 
  lines in all modern societies.
<p>
<p> Ownership of capital is a crucial determinant of class; if you own a large 
  amount of capital you are a capitalist. But it is incorrect to turn this statement 
  round. It is not true that not owning capital makes you proletarian. The Soviet 
  Union was a capitalist state with a class society. The class contradiction was 
  not one of ownership against non-ownership, it was one of possession of social 
  power against powerlessness. The ruling class, the capitalist class of the USSR 
  were the top managers who commanded its economy, its state and its ideological 
  apparatus. The intermediate class between capital and labour was primarily that 
  of the lower managers, whose job it was to rule the enterprises on a day to 
  day basis. <a href="#footnote">1</a><a name =" text"></a> This recognition of 
  the forms of class power in the USSR leads us directly to an examination of 
  so-called mixed economies such as Britain. In Britain too there is state ownership 
  of certain industries. Certainly traditional bourgeois benefit from these industries 
  (through the advantages of planning, or subsidies etc) but these industries 
  are not capitalist by proxy. State industries are in no way "socialist" (in 
  the non capitalist sense). The nationalised industries use wage-labour in order 
  to produce and accumulate surplus value; this is the very essence of capitalist 
  production relations. The individuals who run these industries are themselves 
  a part of the capitalist class in their own right. Finally we look at private 
  enterprises. The stereotypical description of a capitalist enterprise is of 
  a factory owned by a capitalist who controls it directly. This quaint vision 
  must be well over a century out of date (in as much as it was ever really accurate). 
  Typical private enterprises today are owned collectively by capital, through 
  multiple share ownership by both individuals and institutions. They are not 
  operated primarily by individual bourgeois but by top managers. In free market 
  societies, as in state controlled societies, the capitalist class includes top 
  managers, the middle class includes lower managers. In the free market these 
  strata exist along side private capitalists and petty bourgeois. The bourgeoisie, 
  the owners of capital, are ruling class not because they are rich and we aren't. 
  The bourgeoisie are ruling class because their ownership of capital gives them 
  certain rights, abilities, power over productive forces (including variable 
  capital, i.e. their employees). Ownership of capital is only a form of class 
  power that appears in particular variants of capitalism. It has its own characteristics 
  but also has some continuity with other forms of domination, just as the proletarian 
  condition has similarities (as well as differences) to historical forms of subjugation. 
<p class="subtitle">Wages
<p> I will mention another variety of false class theory. Sometimes, it is claimed 
  that class is determined by the amount of wages that a person receives. Now, 
  there is a class difference between the rich and the poor, but this is not due 
  to wage differentials. A class analysis based on wage differences would result 
  in "an infinity of classes". There would also be the problem with differences 
  in wages paid in different regions; either we have regional class differences 
  or regional variations in class analyses. Silly. More to the point such a theory 
  fails to understand what wage differences are about. At one level, wages are 
  determined by the class war, with higher wages reflecting successful struggle 
  by workers. But this is only one side of the story as wages are determined within 
  the context of the capitalist system. In part they reflect the different exchange 
  value of different forms of labour power; some people are paid more because 
  their labour power is more expensive to reproduce. More commonly, wages vary 
  due to fluctuations in the labour market, reflecting supply and demand for different 
  types of labour. Most importantly, wage differentials are deliberately created 
  by capital in order to divide the proletariat. The class is divided by jealousy 
  or elitism, against itself. Basing a class analysis on wage differentials means 
  taking artificial divisions created by capitalism to ensure its own survival, 
  and then deliberately accentuating them. Such theory does capitalism's work 
  for it, and against us.
<p class="subtitle">Communist Analyses
<p> The class analyses I have criticised so far have been essentially, or absolutely, 
  counterrevolutionary. They are used more or less consciously to defend capitalism 
  (though not in each individual instance of their use). There are also class 
  analyses produced by revolutionary currents which I believe are incorrect. Jean 
  Barrot's "Capitalism & Communism", which appeared in "Eclipse and Re-emergence 
  of the Communist Movement", is perhaps the best introduction to communist theory. 
  Especially because it recognises the limitations of theory, and the poverty 
  of what normally passes as theoretical activity. His description of what the 
  proletariat is, for the most part, is an excellent modernisation/generalisation 
  of Marx's theory. One position I disagree with though, is his characterisation 
  of the proletariat as "those who have no reserves". Barrot attributes this phrase 
  to the Left Communist Bordiga but says his purpose was to go back to "the general 
  definition". The function of this definition in Barrot's theory, is to make 
  the struggle of the proletariat primarily a struggle against economic oppression. 
  The class struggle then becomes a function of the ill health of capital. This 
  process is obviously a major source of class composition and class struggle, 
  but is far from adequate to describe the proletariat. If we accept this definition, 
  then we should also accept the arguments of those sociologists, who (especially 
  in the 60's & 70's) declared that the proletariat no longer existed in the developed 
  countries. We should also accept the arguments of liberals and Trotskyists, 
  that revolution is now located in the third world. The Trotskyists say this 
  because western workers are a labour aristocracy and the real proletariat are 
  the impoverished workers overseas. The liberals say it because the west is their 
  (imperfect) paradise, and the third world countries need a democratic revolution 
  to achieve our own general conditions of existence. Barrot recognises alienation 
  as a producer of the proletariat but makes too much of the economic imperatives. 
  Barrot is being too economistic in fact. If we go back to "Critique of Hegel's 
  Philosophy of Right. Introduction" as Barrot recommends, we see that "the proletariat 
  .. is ... formed ...from the mass of people issuing from society's acute disintegration 
  and in particular from the ranks of the middle class". This identification of 
  the middle class origin of the proletariat ties in with comments in the "Economic 
  & Philosophical Manuscripts" on the workers alienation from the product of their 
  labour.
<blockquote> "...man reproduces himself not only intellectually, in his consciousness, 
  but actively and actually, and he can therefore contemplate himself in a world 
  he himself created. In tearing away the object of his production from man, estranged 
  labour therefore tears away from him his species-life..."</blockquote>
<p> This idea that workers (who might be women or men) create themselves in the 
  creation of their product, is almost incomprehensible in really modern industry. 
  Most workers hardly see the product they collectively produce. Where they are 
  really directly involved in its production, then the division of labour is so 
  acute, that they have no room to assert their individuality in the productive 
  process. This was not true in Marx's day. At this time, petty-bourgeois producers 
  were being collected together to produce as proletarians for a single capitalist 
  in manufacturing. Or else petty-bourgeois or manufacturing workers were being 
  collected together in the new social institution of the factory. These new proletarians, 
  issuing from the disintegration of middle-class society, would really have directly 
  felt the alienation of the product of their labour, which previously they themselves 
  would have owned, but which now was possessed by the capitalist. From this we 
  can see the importance of alienation, ahead of impoverishment in Marx's theory, 
  as well as the archaic form of alienation which he talked of in the above passage. 
  Alienation is still the crucial pre-condition for the proletariat, but today 
  takes on yet more acute forms. Nowadays, the worker is alienated from their 
  product to the degree that they hardly recognise it as their own product. The 
  process of producing yourself through your product is itself an almost alien 
  concept. It belongs to another world.
<p> If in general, we can say that Marx's class theory was correct for its time, 
  we should also point out his most spectacular failure in class analysis. In 
  Statism and Anarchy, Bakunin had written that 
<blockquote>"former workers .. as soon as they have become rulers and representatives, cease to be workers .. and look down on the whole common workers' world from the height of the state.  They will no longer represent the common people but only their own claims to rule them."</blockquote>
<p> Marx responded that workers, as representatives or governors, cease to be 
  workers "as little as a factory owner today ceases to be a capitalist if he 
  becomes a municipal councillor" Here Marx misses the point disastrously. Proletarians 
  are defined by their alienation, just as bourgeois are defined by their possession 
  of capital. Factory owners are not proletarianised by the assumption of even 
  greater alienated social power. But proletarians cease to be such when they 
  become representatives, because they take on the power that a ruler or representative 
  possess by definition. Marx is useful where he talks about alienation or political 
  economy, but his politics (and activity) were mostly bourgeois.
<p class="subtitle">Class theory and its use
<p>
So far  a way of determining the class position of different groups in society has been identified, by analysing the amount of social power that they wield.  But it has not yet been said what this characterisation means, how it helps us.  The utility of class analysis is in identifying the material interests of different social groups, both in the day to day running of capital, and in the on going struggle against it.  The main reason why the proletariat is so often identified as the revolutionary class, is precisely because it has no material interest in the maintenance of capitalism, either immediately or in the long term.  The capitalist class, both owners and top managers, are the class that directly benefits from the present society, and will organise whatever measures are necessary to ensure its  continued existence.  The middle class, be they petty bourgeois, peasants or the new middle class, are society's leftovers.  
<p> The middle class are both exploiter and exploited, or they are neither; they 
  have some small privilege but no real security. Proletarianisation is a constant 
  imminent danger for the middle class, and something they always fight to prevent. 
  This struggle can be reactionary where it means a struggle against the proletariat 
  to defend middle class position. But it can potentially be revolutionary when 
  it is a struggle against capital's encroachment, and can lead to united action 
  with the proletariat. In general, the middle class are only defined by their 
  position in this society, and not by their struggles. This is because this class 
  has no clear class interest in or against capital, and so never struggles as 
  a class.
<p> The proletariat is defined first of all by its dispossession. It exists as 
  a negativity, as something alienated from this society, and which can never 
  be wholly integrated. These radical chains lead to radical struggle. Proletarian 
  struggles are always anti-capitalist (in potential) because the proletariat 
  can find no liberation within capitalism. Its struggle therefore tends towards 
  an all out struggle against capital. This tendency comes to the fore only too 
  rarely. Most of the time the proletariat exists primarily as a class defined 
  by capitalism. Only through struggle can it form itself into a community consciously 
  opposed to capitalism. The material conditions of existence of the class precede 
  radical class consciousness.
<p> The capitalist class is a small minority of the world population. Capitalism 
  requires competition and therefore struggles between rival capitals. The capitalist 
  class can therefore never be fully unified. However, capitalists must struggle 
  not only against themselves, but also against all the other classes. The ruling 
  class is under permanent assault from many directions. This results in a high 
  degree of class consciousness possessed by the capitalist class. When a powerful 
  anti-capitalist struggle breaks out, rival capitals can temporarily bury the 
  hatchet and act in concert against the proletariat. The usual stereotype of 
  the bourgeois is of a fat, top-hatted oaf, smoking a large cigar. It should 
  be realised that the ruling class is small, fast and ruthless.
<p> So who are our enemies; just the capitalist class or both they and the middle 
  class? When it comes down to it the answer is: neither. What really destroys 
  us is not the rich or their functionaries, it is the social relations of capitalism. 
  It is the accumulation of capital, wage labour, social isolation, the state, 
  borders, and more besides, that we are really need to do away with. In as much 
  as the capitalist class, the middle class, or even the working class defend 
  these relationships they act against our own liberation and the liberation of 
  humanity as a whole. The point about class analysis, is that we can see who 
  is most likely to defend these relations, and who is most likely to attack them. 
  I once had a talk with someone who said that we should reopen Auschwitz and 
  exterminate the richest 2% in this country. This kind of extremism has a sort 
  of gut appeal. But there were a couple of problems. One was that this guy was 
  a South African fascist who identified himself as an Anglo-Saxon. He argued 
  that apartheid was more strongly established in the UK than it then was in South 
  Africa, and that the ruling class was entirely of Norman origins. His wish to 
  wipe out the rich was akin to the Nazi extermination of (Jewish) finance capitalists. 
  The second problem was the industrial, and therefore capitalist, nature of his 
  solution. The reason that we can't use prisons, concentration camps, or even 
  firing squads for our liberation is not that we are liberals who respect an 
  absolute right to life. It's because these are dehumanising institutions for 
  the jailers as well as the condemned. Rebel violence can be liberating, but 
  can never be institutional. We use enough violence to achieve our aims; we need 
  to create a new community out of our struggle, hopefully as many people as possible 
  can be integrated into this human community as rapidly as possible. As the revolution 
  develops, more and more people will be attracted to it. We aim to unite with 
  whoever really shares our struggle no matter what role they play under normal 
  conditions. The situationist Ratgeb/Vaneigem expressed this brilliantly: "Doesn't 
  it give you a certain sense of pleasure to think how, some day soon, you will 
  be able to treat as human beings those cops whom it will not have been necessary 
  to kill on the spot?"
<p class="subtitle">Back to reality<a name="backtoreal"></a>
<p> This article has presented a theory, an analytical tool. But it has done it 
  in a too abstract way. Where did these thoughts come from, a book, a discussion, 
  a dream? These ideas did not appear fully formed but have been put together 
  by me from my own experiences in this society, and my own experiences in my 
  struggle against it, as well as from talking with other radicals and reading 
  different books . This is a process started perhaps fifteen years ago and still 
  continuing (though my ideas on class have only changed in details in the last 
  eight years, say). I will retell some of my own experiences, so that you can 
  understand more where I am coming from, and to bring this down to earth a bit 
  more. 
<p class="subtitle"> "But Teacher!"
<p> My first involvement in any collective class struggle was at age eleven. At 
  that time I was going to the comprehensive school on the council estate where 
  I lived. Most of the kids there were working class, or else they were lower 
  middle class. (Of course they all had similar amounts of social power, none, 
  but where people are "temporarily" outside of the cycle of accumulation, it 
  is probably sensible to look at their class background.) That year there were 
  a number of teachers' strikes which resulted in some disruption of classes. 
  We even got sent home early a couple of times, which was brilliant. Some kid, 
  with a good sense of humour, had the idea that we should all go on strike "in 
  support" of the teachers. Basically we just all met up at the tennis courts 
  and didn't return to lessons. What was the reaction of the teachers to this 
  mass "support" for their cause? They made no attempt at fraternisation with 
  us. Their only response was to try to get us to return to normal passivity. 
  One vision that stays with me is of one of the teachers, a leftwinger, fighting 
  with one of the fifth years to prevent him joining our strike. All the teachers, 
  and all the pupils recognised the true situation, that there could be no unity 
  between the students and staff, only class conflict. Teachers, as part of their 
  job, have a role in supervising and disciplining pupils. They also disseminate 
  capitalist propaganda. Their role is one of socialising school kids into capitalist 
  normality, the five day week, obeying orders; even the more or less useful stuff 
  such as teaching kids to read is carried out because capitalism needs an educated 
  workforce. Teachers, at least those who work in compulsory education, are part 
  of the middle class, because of the direct power they wield and because of their 
  role in perpetuating ruling class ideology (although they are not major players 
  in this field). Of course teachers do engage in collective class struggle. When 
  these struggles are not aimed at protecting their "status", but are for a wage 
  increase say, then we can even see some sort of "proletarian" content. But struggles 
  that go against this society, struggles which hold the seeds of capitalism's 
  destruction, are those that are expansive, which tend to unite more and more 
  people. Teachers are, through their social position, divided against a large 
  part of the proletariat (schoolkids) and they will have to go that much further 
  to break from their social position. This doesn't mean that there can't be some 
  individuals who are more strongly against their official role, I certainly have 
  met a couple of teachers who have been involved in riots for instance. But class 
  analysis is not useful for predicting the behaviour of each individual in a 
  certain class position, only the general characteristics of that group as a 
  whole. I should add here that there are certain categories of teachers, those 
  who do not work in the compulsory sector and who are not deeply involved in 
  the reproduction of ruling ideology, who are probably proletarian, or at least 
  much closer to that condition. I'm thinking in particular of those that work 
  in community education colleges, and some of those that do workplace training. 
  This is not because I want to make some exception, perhaps for someone I know, 
  but because they do not possess the criteria that make them middle class; i.e. 
  capital, power, a significant spectacular function. This lack of homogeneity, 
  sameness, is not just restricted to teachers, but appears in almost any sociological 
  grouping. I will say again, sociology, the identification and classification 
  of separate groups in society, is of no use as a basis for radical class analysis.
<p class="subtitle">It's Official 
<p> I have worked only in the non unionised private sector, or in temporary or 
  casual jobs. This, together with the fact that I had a basic anarchist critique 
  of unions before I left school, has meant that I have never been a union member. 
  To me they have always seemed organisations of this society, not things outside 
  or against it. This has meant that much of my criticism of unions has been second 
  hand, based on the experiences of friends, family and comrades as well as stuff 
  I have read. I have only come into conflict with unions in certain large workers' 
  struggles, and first of all that against News International 1986 - 1987. This 
  struggle started when the majority of the workforce was sacked. The union tried 
  to keep things legal and peaceful, supposedly trying to win over public opinion. 
  The struggle of the sacked printers, local youths, and extremists was continuingly 
  violent, aimed at the cops, scabs and NI property. The police tactics were also 
  very violent. The top bureaucrats of course condemned any violent action by 
  the pickets (but not the cops) over their PA. This surprised no one of course. 
  What particularly struck me were the actions of the steward in charge of the 
  picket, Mike Hicks. He not only condemned the violence, even that in self-defence, 
  but called anyone attacking the police, "agent provocateurs" (i.e. police agents). 
  He also physically attacked people who argued for this type of action. These 
  counterrevolutionary actions were carried out not by the top union bureaucrats, 
  but by a low level official. Hicks himself was a Stalinist, and so a more or 
  less conscious counterrevolutionary. But his actions are not so far removed 
  from that other union officials. Unions are capitalist institutions which have 
  as their function the representation of variable capital, i.e. workers. They 
  negotiate the rate or form of exploitation, according to their own interests 
  (they need, from time to time to demonstrate their usefulness to both boss and 
  worker). They are entirely part of the present system and can only attempt to 
  repress any struggle that goes against this system. Union officials, at all 
  levels, are in the belly of the beast, and are in fact separated from the proletariat. 
  This is due to the increased social power that they enjoy. Their middle class 
  nature can be seen by the fact that despite often being the most militant of 
  workers on day to day issues, in the more bitter struggles they always play 
  a conservative role, pulled three ways trying to represent the workers, the 
  union, and the manager or boss. 
<p> Growing up in a working class environment, I gained a hatred for the police 
  before gaining any formal radical politics. Friends and family were arrested 
  or imprisoned, the pigs came round our house to check up on us, we were stopped 
  and hassled in the street, they came to our school to indoctrinate us. The "marxist" 
  class theory, that just looks at the relationship to capital, defines the police 
  as proletarian, because cops don't own any means of production. Some groups 
  run with this result, and call for the unionisation of the police (in Germany, 
  unionised cops have been on strike for more repressive powers). Other groups 
  find it embarrassing to define pigs as working class, and twist their theory 
  to correct this one error. In reality, police are middle class, and not because 
  they are the exception to the rule. They are the purest example of holders of 
  alienated social power. Those radicals who call teachers or shop stewards "soft 
  cops" hit the nail on the head; these other middle class groups are only a diluted 
  form of the archetype.
<p class="subtitle">Contradictions
<p> I have pointed out contradictions or capitalist interests in certain class 
  theories. I can't however claim that the one I have presented can unerringly 
  categorise every individual. One problem area is that of "housewives" or other 
  full-time unpaid carers. (The role of the stereotypical housewife, who stays 
  at home, looking after the house and the kids, has gone into decline since the 
  sixties. This is due both to women's struggle, and to capitalist restructuring, 
  away from the model of factory and stable nuclear family. But this role is still 
  something of an archetype for women in this society.) "Housewives" and other 
  carers perform labour in the context of a capitalist society. They produce and 
  reproduce the commodity of labour power. The work they do is productive labour 
  appropriated by capital as surplus value. Having said this, the category of 
  "housewives", like the category of wage labourers, is not homogenous. Just as 
  some wage labourers are middle class because of the social power they wield, 
  so it is with "housewives" as well. These at first glance all appear to have 
  the same social power and so all appear to be of the same class. It would be 
  wrong to argue this way. As hinted at in the discussion above on school kids, 
  in these areas, where the means of subsistence aren't paid directly as a wage 
  for work done, it is often necessary to look at the "class background" of the 
  people involved. So that if a woman who doesn't go out to work is married to 
  a middle class man, it is probably reasonable to say that she is middle class 
  too. She would certainly share some of his material interests, and therefore 
  consciousness. It is still the case that "housewives" don't have any direct 
  usage of social power, and are effectively unpaid workers, so this may mean 
  a downward pressure on class position, a partial proletarianisation. I am aware 
  that this is a weakness in the class analysis I have put forward. There are 
  other difficulties that now arise. What happens when a couple are from two different 
  classes, say one a manager, the other a non-supervisory worker? From the example 
  on housewives, we would have to say that the non-supervisory worker is elevated 
  into the middle-class. If this is starting to get silly, it is not because the 
  class analysis is totally wrong, it is because this is the wrong way to use 
  it. Classes are social phenomenon, that are created in the mutual antagonism 
  inherent in exploitative society. Using class analysis to analyse individual 
  people in isolation is a moralistic endeavour, not a radical one. This is an 
  important fact that many leftists totally ignore. For them the ability to individually 
  "analyse" and condemn particular political enemies (or justify themselves) is 
  their only reason for using class theory.
<p class="subtitle">Class Community
<p> Class is a social relation amongst large groups in society. It is not an object 
  open to scientific analysis but exists in the conflict between classes. These 
  class conflicts are power struggles primarily between a minority of possessors 
  of social power and a majority whose social power is alienated from them. In 
  capitalist society, alienation takes on specific forms. These include direct 
  authority relationships, capital, and the spectacle. The function of, and need 
  for a class theory is to understand how to destroy capitalist society by and 
  through the creation of anti-capitalist modes of living. The revolutionary proletarian 
  struggle is not an attempt to raise the proletariat to the position of a ruling 
  class, but to abolish all classes through the destruction of capitalist social 
  relations. The real communist movement is our struggle, the community we create 
  through struggle against the social relations that destroy us. Communist or 
  anarchist society is the victory of this real social movement, the generalisation 
  of this human community.</p>
