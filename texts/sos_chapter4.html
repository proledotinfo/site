  The real movement that transforms existing conditions has been the dominant 
  social force since the bourgeoisie&#8217;s victory within the economic sphere, 
  and this dominance became visible once that victory was translated onto the 
  political plane. The development of productive forces shattered the old production 
  relations, and all static order crumbled. Everything that was absolute became 
  historical. </p>
<p class="subtitle">74</p><p>

  When people are thrust into history and forced to participate in the work and 
  struggles that constitute history, they find themselves obliged to view their 
  relationships in a clear and disabused manner. This history has no object distinct 
  from what it creates from out of itself, although the final unconscious metaphysical 
  vision of the historical era considered the productive progression through which 
  history had unfolded as itself the object of history. As for the subject of 
  history, it can be nothing other than the self-production of the living &#8212; 
  living people becoming masters and possessors of their own historical world 
  and of their own fully conscious adventures. </p>
<p class="subtitle">75</p><p>

  The class struggles of the long era of revolutions initiated by the rise of 
  the bourgeoisie have developed in tandem with the dialectical &#8220;thought 
  of history&#8221; &#8212; the thought which is no longer content to seek the 
  meaning of what exists, but which strives to comprehend the dissolution of what 
  exists, and in the process breaks down every separation. </p>
<p class="subtitle">76</p><p>

  For Hegel the point was no longer to interpret the world, but to interpret the 
  transformation of the world. But because he limited himself to merely interpreting 
  that transformation, Hegel only represents the philosophical culmination of 
  philosophy. He seeks to understand a world that develops by itself. This historical 
  thought is still a consciousness that always arrives too late, a consciousness 
  that can only formulate retrospective justifications of what has already happened. 
  It has thus gone beyond separation only in thought. Hegel&#8217;s paradoxical 
  stance &#8212; his subordination of the meaning of all reality to its historical 
  culmination while at the same time proclaiming that his own system represents 
  that culmination &#8212; flows from the simple fact that this thinker of the 
  bourgeois revolutions of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries sought in 
  his philosophy only a reconciliation with the results of those revolutions. 
  &#8220;Even as a philosophy of the bourgeois revolution, it does not express 
  the entire process of this revolution, but only its concluding phase. In this 
  sense it is a philosophy not of the revolution, but of the restoration&#8221; 
  (Karl Korsch, &#8220;Theses on Hegel and Revolution&#8221;). Hegel performed 
  the task of the philosopher &#8212; &#8220;the glorification of what exists&#8221; 
  &#8212; for the last time; but already what existed for him could be nothing 
  less than the entire movement of history. Since he nevertheless maintained the 
  external position of thought, this externality could be masked only by identifying 
  that thought with a preexisting project of the Spirit &#8212; of that absolute 
  heroic force which has done what it willed and willed what it has done, and 
  whose ultimate goal coincides with the present. Philosophy, in the process of 
  being superseded by historical thought, has thus arrived at the point where 
  it can glorify its world only by denying it, since in order to speak it must 
  presuppose that the total history to which it has relegated everything has already 
  come to an end, and that the only tribunal where truth could be judged is closed. 
</p>
<p class="subtitle">77</p><p>

  When the proletariat demonstrates through its own actions that this historical 
  thought has not been forgotten, its refutation of that thought&#8217;s conclusion 
  is at the same time a confirmation of its method. </p>
<p class="subtitle">78</p><p>

  Historical thought can be saved only by becoming practical thought; and the 
  practice of the proletariat as a revolutionary class can be nothing less than 
  historical consciousness operating on the totality of its world. All the theoretical 
  currents of the revolutionary working-class movement &#8212; Stirner and Bakunin 
  as well as Marx &#8212; grew out of a critical confrontation with Hegelian thought. 
</p>
<p class="subtitle">79</p><p>

  The inseparability of Marx&#8217;s theory from the Hegelian method is itself 
  inseparable from that theory&#8217;s revolutionary character, that is, from 
  its truth. It is in this regard that the relationship between Marx and Hegel 
  has generally been ignored or misunderstood, or even denounced as the weak point 
  of what became fallaciously transformed into a doctrine: &#8220;Marxism.&#8221; 
  Bernstein implicitly revealed this connection between the dialectical method 
  and historical partisanship when in his book Evolutionary Socialism he deplored 
  the 1847 Manifesto&#8217;s unscientific predictions of imminent proletarian 
  revolution in Germany: &#8220;This historical self-deception, so erroneous that 
  the most na&iuml;ve political visionary could hardly have done any worse, would 
  be incomprehensible in a Marx who at that time had already seriously studied 
  economics if we did not recognize that it reflected the lingering influence 
  of the antithetical Hegelian dialectic, from which Marx, like Engels, could 
  never completely free himself. In those times of general effervescence this 
  influence was all the more fatal to him.&#8221; </p>
<p class="subtitle">80</p><p>

  The inversion carried out by Marx in order to &#8220;salvage&#8221; the thought 
  of the bourgeois revolutions by transferring it to a different context does 
  not trivially consist of putting the materialist development of productive forces 
  in place of the journey of the Hegelian Spirit toward its eventual encounter 
  with itself &#8212; the Spirit whose objectification is identical to its alienation 
  and whose historical wounds leave no scars. For once history becomes real, it 
  no longer has an end. Marx demolished Hegel&#8217;s position of detachment from 
  events, as well as passive contemplation by any supreme external agent whatsoever. 
  Henceforth, theory&#8217;s concern is simply to know what it itself is doing. 
  In contrast, present-day society&#8217;s passive contemplation of the movement 
  of the economy is an untranscended holdover from the undialectical aspect of 
  Hegel&#8217;s attempt to create a circular system; it is an approval that is 
  no longer on the conceptual level and that no longer needs a Hegelianism to 
  justify itself, because the movement it now praises is a sector of a world where 
  thought no longer has any place, a sector whose mechanical development effectively 
  dominates everything. Marx&#8217;s project is a project of conscious history, 
  in which the quantitativeness that arises out of the blind development of merely 
  economic productive forces must be transformed into a qualitative appropriation 
  of history. The critique of political economy is the first act of this end of 
  prehistory: &#8220;Of all the instruments of production, the greatest productive 
  power is the revolutionary class itself.&#8221; </p>
<p class="subtitle">81</p><p>

  Marx&#8217;s theory is closely linked with scientific thought insofar as it 
  seeks a rational understanding of the forces that really operate in society. 
  But it ultimately goes beyond scientific thought, preserving it only by superseding 
  it. It seeks to understand social struggles, not sociological laws. &#8220;We 
  recognize only one science: the science of history&#8221; (The German Ideology). 
</p>
<p class="subtitle">82</p><p>

  The bourgeois era, which wants to give history a scientific foundation, overlooks 
  the fact that the science available to it could itself arise only on the foundation 
  of the historical development of the economy. But history is fundamentally dependent 
  on this economic knowledge only so long as it remains merely economic history. 
  The extent to which the viewpoint of scientific observation could overlook history&#8217;s 
  effect on the economy (an overall process modifying its own scientific premises) 
  is shown by the vanity of those socialists who thought they had calculated the 
  exact periodicity of economic crises. Now that constant government intervention 
  has succeeded in counteracting the tendencies toward crisis, the same type of 
  mentality sees this delicate balance as a definitive economic harmony. The project 
  of transcending the economy and mastering history must grasp and incorporate 
  the science of society, but it cannot itself be a scientific project. The revolutionary 
  movement remains bourgeois insofar as it thinks it can master current history 
  by means of scientific knowledge. </p>
<p class="subtitle">83</p><p>

  The utopian currents of socialism, though they are historically grounded in 
  criticism of the existing social system, can rightly be called utopian insofar 
  as they ignore history (that is, insofar as they ignore actual struggles taking 
  place and any passage of time outside the immutable perfection of their image 
  of a happy society), but not because they reject science. On the contrary, the 
  utopian thinkers were completely dominated by the scientific thought of earlier 
  centuries. They sought the completion and fulfillment of that general rational 
  system. They did not consider themselves unarmed prophets, for they firmly believed 
  in the social power of scientific proof and even, in the case of Saint-Simonism, 
  in the seizure of power by science. &#8220;Why,&#8221; Sombart asked, &#8220;would 
  they want to seize through struggle what merely needed to be proved?&#8221; 
  But the utopians&#8217; scientific understanding did not include the awareness 
  that some social groups have vested interests in maintaining the status quo, 
  forces to maintain it, and forms of false consciousness to reinforce it. Their 
  grasp of reality thus lagged far behind the historical reality of the development 
  of science itself, which had been largely oriented by the social requirements 
  arising from such factors, which determined not only what findings were considered 
  acceptable, but even what might or might not become an object of scientific 
  research. The utopian socialists remained prisoners of the scientific manner 
  of expounding the truth, viewing this truth as a pure abstract image &#8212; 
  the form in which it had established itself at a much earlier stage of social 
  development. As Sorel noted, the utopians took astronomy as their model for 
  discovering and demonstrating the laws of society; their unhistorical conception 
  of harmony was the natural result of their attempt to apply to society the science 
  least dependent on history. They described this harmony as if they were Newtons 
  discovering universal scientific laws, and the happy ending they constantly 
  evoked &#8220;plays a role in their social science analogous to the role of 
  inertia in classical physics&#8221; (Materials for a Theory of the Proletariat). 
  </p>
<p class="subtitle">84</p><p>

  The scientific-determinist aspect of Marx&#8217;s thought was precisely what 
  made it vulnerable to &#8220;ideologization,&#8221; both during his own lifetime 
  and even more so in the theoretical heritage he left to the workers movement. 
  The advent of the historical subject continues to be postponed, and it is economics, 
  the historical science par excellence, which is increasingly seen as guaranteeing 
  the inevitability of its own future negation. In this way revolutionary practice, 
  the only true agent of this negation, tends to be pushed out of theory&#8217;s 
  field of vision. Instead, it is seen as essential to patiently study economic 
  development, and to go back to accepting the suffering which that development 
  imposes with a Hegelian tranquility. The result remains &#8220;a graveyard of 
  good intentions.&#8221; The &#8220;science of revolutions&#8221; then concludes 
  that consciousness always comes too soon, and has to be taught. &#8220;History 
  has shown that we, and all who thought as we did, were wrong,&#8221; Engels 
  wrote in 1895. &#8220;It has made clear that the state of economic development 
  on the Continent at that time was far from being ripe.&#8221; Throughout his 
  life Marx had maintained a unitary point of view in his theory, but the exposition 
  of his theory was carried out on the terrain of the dominant thought insofar 
  as it took the form of critiques of particular disciplines, most notably the 
  critique of the fundamental science of bourgeois society, political economy. 
  It was in this mutilated form, which eventually came to be seen as orthodox, 
  that Marx&#8217;s theory was transformed into &#8220;Marxism.&#8221; </p>
<p class="subtitle">85</p><p>

  The weakness of Marx&#8217;s theory is naturally linked to the weakness of the 
  revolutionary struggle of the proletariat of his time. The German working class 
  failed to inaugurate a permanent revolution in 1848; the Paris Commune was defeated 
  in isolation. As a result, revolutionary theory could not yet be fully realized. 
  The fact that Marx was reduced to defending and refining it by cloistered scholarly 
  work in the British Museum had a debilitating effect on the theory itself. His 
  scientific conclusions about the future development of the working class, and 
  the organizational practice apparently implied by those conclusions, became 
  obstacles to proletarian consciousness at a later stage. </p>
<p class="subtitle">86</p><p>

  The theoretical shortcomings of the scientific defense of proletarian revolution 
  (both in its content and in its form of exposition) all ultimately result from 
  identifying the proletariat with the bourgeoisie with respect to the revolutionary 
  seizure of power. </p>
<p class="subtitle">87</p><p>

  As early as the Communist Manifesto, Marx&#8217;s effort to demonstrate the 
  legitimacy of proletarian power by citing a repetitive sequence of precedents 
  led him to oversimplify his historical analysis into a linear model of the development 
  of modes of production, in which class struggles invariably resulted &#8220;either 
  in a revolutionary transformation of the entire society or in the mutual ruin 
  of the contending classes.&#8221; The plain facts of history, however, are that 
  the &#8220;Asiatic mode of production&#8221; (as Marx himself acknowledged elsewhere) 
  maintained its immobility despite all its class conflicts; that no serf uprising 
  ever overthrew the feudal lords; and that none of the slave revolts in the ancient 
  world ended the rule of the freemen. The linear schema loses sight of the fact 
  that the bourgeoisie is the only revolutionary class that has ever won; and 
  that it is also the only class for which the development of the economy was 
  both the cause and the consequence of its taking control of society. The same 
  oversimplification led Marx to neglect the economic role of the state in the 
  management of class society. If the rising bourgeoisie seemed to liberate the 
  economy from the state, this was true only to the extent that the previous state 
  was an instrument of class oppression within a static economy. The bourgeoisie 
  originally developed its independent economic power during the medieval period 
  when the state had been weakening and feudalism was breaking up the stable equilibrium 
  between different powers. In contrast, the modern state &#8212; which began 
  to support the bourgeoisie&#8217;s development through its mercantile policies 
  and which developed into the bourgeoisie&#8217;s own state during the laissez-faire 
  era &#8212; was eventually to emerge as a central power in the planned management 
  of the economic process. Marx was nevertheless able to describe the &#8220;Bonapartist&#8221; 
  prototype of modern statist bureaucracy, the fusion of capital and state to 
  create a &#8220;national power of capital over labor, a public force designed 
  to maintain social servitude&#8221; &#8212; a form of social order in which 
  the bourgeoisie renounces all historical life apart from what has been reduced 
  to the economic history of things, and would like to be &#8220;condemned to 
  the same political nothingness as all the other classes.&#8221; The sociopolitical 
  foundations of the modern spectacle are already discernable here, and these 
  foundations negatively imply that the proletariat is the only pretender to historical 
  life. </p>
<p class="subtitle">88</p><p>

  The only two classes that really correspond to Marx&#8217;s theory, the two 
  pure classes that the entire analysis of Capital brings to the fore, are the 
  bourgeoisie and the proletariat. These are also the only two revolutionary classes 
  in history, but operating under very different conditions. The bourgeois revolution 
  is done. The proletarian revolution is a yet-unrealized project, born on the 
  foundation of the earlier revolution but differing from it qualitatively. If 
  one overlooks the originality of the historical role of the bourgeoisie, one 
  also tends to overlook the specific originality of the proletarian project, 
  which can achieve nothing unless it carries its own banners and recognizes the 
  &#8220;immensity of its own tasks.&#8221; The bourgeoisie came to power because 
  it was the class of the developing economy. The proletariat cannot create its 
  own new form of power except by becoming the class of consciousness. The growth 
  of productive forces will not in itself guarantee the emergence of such a power 
  &#8212; not even indirectly by way of the increasing dispossession which that 
  growth entails. Nor can a Jacobin-style seizure of the state be a means to this 
  end. The proletariat cannot make use of any ideology designed to disguise its 
  partial goals as general goals, because the proletariat cannot preserve any 
  partial reality that is truly its own. </p>
<p class="subtitle">89</p><p>

  If Marx, during a certain period of his participation in the proletarian struggle, 
  placed too great a reliance on scientific prediction, to the point of creating 
  the intellectual basis for the illusions of economism, it is clear that he himself 
  did not succumb to those illusions. In a well-known letter of 7 December 1867, 
  accompanying an article criticizing Capital which he himself had written but 
  which he wanted Engels to present to the press as the work of an adversary, 
  Marx clearly indicated the limits of his own science: &#8220;The author&#8217;s 
  subjective tendency (imposed on him, perhaps, by his political position and 
  his past), namely the manner in which he views and presents the final outcome 
  of the present movement and social process, has no connection with his actual 
  analysis.&#8221; By thus disparaging the &#8220;tendentious conclusions&#8221; 
  of his own objective analysis, and by the irony of the &#8220;perhaps&#8221; 
  with reference to the extrascientific choices supposedly &#8220;imposed&#8221; 
  on him, Marx implicitly revealed the methodological key to fusing the two aspects. 
 </p>
<p class="subtitle">90</p><p>

  The fusion of knowledge and action must be effected within the historical struggle 
  itself, in such a way that each depends on the other for its validation. The 
  proletarian class is formed into a subject in its process of organizing revolutionary 
  struggles and in its reorganization of society at the moment of revolution &#8212; 
  this is where the practical conditions of consciousness must exist, conditions 
  in which the theory of praxis is confirmed by becoming practical theory. But 
  this crucial question of organization was virtually ignored by revolutionary 
  theory during the period when the workers movement was first taking shape &#8212; 
  the very period when that theory still possessed the unitary character it had 
  inherited from historical thought (and which it had rightly vowed to develop 
  into a unitary historical practice). Instead, the organizational question became 
  the weakest aspect of radical theory, a confused terrain lending itself to the 
  revival of hierarchical and statist tactics borrowed from the bourgeois revolution. 
  The forms of organization of the workers movement that were developed on the 
  basis of this theoretical negligence tended in turn to inhibit the maintenance 
  of a unitary theory by breaking it up into various specialized and fragmented 
  disciplines. This ideologically alienated theory was then no longer able to 
  recognize the practical verifications of the unitary historical thought it had 
  betrayed when such verifications emerged in spontaneous working-class struggles; 
  instead, it contributed toward repressing every manifestation and memory of 
  them. Yet those historical forms that took shape in struggle were precisely 
  the practical terrain that was needed in order to validate the theory. They 
  were what the theory needed, yet that need had not been formulated theoretically. 
  The soviet, for example, was not a theoretical discovery. And the most advanced 
  theoretical truth of the International Workingmen&#8217;s Association was its 
  own existence in practice. </p>
<p class="subtitle">91</p><p>

  The First International&#8217;s initial successes enabled it to free itself 
  from the confused influences of the dominant ideology that had survived within 
  it. But the defeat and repression that it soon encountered brought to the surface 
  a conflict between two different conceptions of proletarian revolution, each 
  of which contained an authoritarian aspect that amounted to abandoning the conscious 
  self-emancipation of the working class. The feud between the Marxists and the 
  Bakuninists, which eventually became irreconcilable, actually centered on two 
  different issues &#8212; the question of power in a future revolutionary society 
  and the question of the organization of the current movement &#8212; and each 
  of the adversaries reversed their position when they went from one aspect to 
  the other. Bakunin denounced the illusion that classes could be abolished by 
  means of an authoritarian implementation of state power, warning that this would 
  lead to the formation of a new bureaucratic ruling class and to the dictatorship 
  of the most knowledgeable (or of those reputed to be such). Marx, who believed 
  that the concomitant maturation of economic contradictions and of the workers&#8217; 
  education in democracy would reduce the role of a proletarian state to a brief 
  phase needed to legitimize the new social relations brought into being by objective 
  factors, denounced Bakunin and his supporters as an authoritarian conspiratorial 
  elite who were deliberately placing themselves above the International with 
  the harebrained scheme of imposing on society an irresponsible dictatorship 
  of the most revolutionary (or of those who would designate themselves as such). 
  Bakunin did in fact recruit followers on such a basis: &#8220;In the midst of 
  the popular tempest we must be the invisible pilots guiding the revolution, 
  not through any kind of overt power but through the collective dictatorship 
  of our Alliance &#8212; a dictatorship without any badges or titles or official 
  status, yet all the more powerful because it will have none of the appearances 
  of power.&#8221; Thus two ideologies of working-class revolution opposed each 
  other, each containing a partially true critique, but each losing the unity 
  of historical thought and setting itself up as an ideological authority. Powerful 
  organizations such as German Social Democracy and the Iberian Anarchist Federation 
  faithfully served one or the other of these ideologies; and everywhere the result 
  was very different from what had been sought. </p>
<p class="subtitle">92</p><p>

  The fact that anarchists have seen the goal of proletarian revolution as immediately 
  present represents both the strength and the weakness of collectivist anarchist 
  struggles (the only forms of anarchism that can be taken seriously &#8212; the 
  pretensions of the individualist forms of anarchism have always been ludicrous). 
  From the historical thought of modern class struggles collectivist anarchism 
  retains only the conclusion, and its constant harping on this conclusion is 
  accompanied by a deliberate indifference to any consideration of methods. Its 
  critique of political struggle has thus remained abstract, while its commitment 
  to economic struggle has been channeled toward the mirage of a definitive solution 
  that will supposedly be achieved by a single blow on this terrain, on the day 
  of the general strike or the insurrection. The anarchists have saddled themselves 
  with fulfilling an ideal. Anarchism remains a merely ideological negation of 
  the state and of class society &#8212; the very social conditions which in their 
  turn foster separate ideologies. It is the ideology of pure freedom, an ideology 
  that puts everything on the same level and loses any conception of the &#8220;historical 
  evil&#8221; (the negation at work within history). This fusion of all partial 
  demands into a single all-encompassing demand has given anarchism the merit 
  of representing the rejection of existing conditions in the name of the whole 
  of life rather than from the standpoint of some particular critical specialization; 
  but the fact that this fusion has been envisaged only in the absolute, in accordance 
  with individual whim and in advance of any practical actualization, has doomed 
  anarchism to an all too obvious incoherence. Anarchism responds to each particular 
  struggle by repeating and reapplying the same simple and all-embracing lesson, 
  because this lesson has from the beginning been considered the be-all and end-all 
  of the movement. This is reflected in Bakunin&#8217;s 1873 letter of resignation 
  from the Jura Federation: &#8220;During the past nine years the International 
  has developed more than enough ideas to save the world, if ideas alone could 
  save it, and I challenge anyone to come up with a new one. It&#8217;s no longer 
  the time for ideas, it&#8217;s time for actions.&#8221; This perspective undoubtedly 
  retains proletarian historical thought&#8217;s recognition that ideas must be 
  put into practice, but it abandons the historical terrain by assuming that the 
  appropriate forms for this transition to practice have already been discovered 
  and will never change. </p>
<p class="subtitle">93</p><p>

  The anarchists, who explicitly distinguish themselves from the rest of the workers 
  movement by their ideological conviction, reproduce this separation of competencies 
  within their own ranks by providing a terrain that facilitates the informal 
  domination of each particular anarchist organization by propagandists and defenders 
  of their ideology, specialists whose mediocre intellectual activity is largely 
  limited to the constant regurgitation of a few eternal truths. The anarchists&#8217; 
  ideological reverence for unanimous decisionmaking has ended up paving the way 
  for uncontrolled manipulation of their own organizations by specialists in freedom; 
  and revolutionary anarchism expects the same type of unanimity, obtained by 
  the same means, from the masses once they have been liberated. Furthermore, 
  the anarchists&#8217; refusal to take into account the great differences between 
  the conditions of a minority banded together in present-day struggles and of 
  a postrevolutionary society of free individuals has repeatedly led to the isolation 
  of anarchists when the moment for collective decisionmaking actually arrives, 
  as is shown by the countless anarchist insurrections in Spain that were contained 
  and crushed at a local level. </p>
<p class="subtitle">94</p><p>

  The illusion more or less explicitly maintained by genuine anarchism is its 
  constant belief that a revolution is just around the corner, and that the instantaneous 
  accomplishment of this revolution will demonstrate the truth of anarchist ideology 
  and of the form of practical organization that has developed in accordance with 
  that ideology. In 1936 anarchism did indeed initiate a social revolution, a 
  revolution that was the most advanced expression of proletarian power ever realized. 
  But even in that case it should be noted that the general uprising began as 
  a merely defensive reaction to the army&#8217;s attempted coup. Furthermore, 
  inasmuch as the revolution was not carried to completion during its opening 
  days (because Franco controlled half the country and was being strongly supported 
  from abroad, because the rest of the international proletarian movement had 
  already been defeated, and because the anti-Franco camp included various bourgeois 
  forces and statist working-class parties), the organized anarchist movement 
  proved incapable of extending the revolution&#8217;s partial victories, or even 
  of defending them. Its recognized leaders became government ministers, hostages 
  to a bourgeois state that was destroying the revolution even as it proceeded 
  to lose the civil war. </p>
<p class="subtitle">95</p><p>

  The &#8220;orthodox Marxism&#8221; of the Second International is the scientific 
  ideology of socialist revolution, an ideology which identifies its whole truth 
  with objective economic processes and with the progressive recognition of the 
  inevitability of those processes by a working class educated by the organization. 
  This ideology revives the faith in pedagogical demonstration that was found 
  among the utopian socialists, combining that faith with a contemplative invocation 
  of the course of history; but it has lost both the Hegelian dimension of total 
  history and the static image of totality presented by the utopians (most richly 
  by Fourier). This type of scientific attitude, which can do nothing more than 
  resurrect the traditional dilemmas between symmetrical ethical choices, is at 
  the root of Hilferding&#8217;s absurd conclusion that recognizing the inevitability 
  of socialism &#8220;gives no indication as to what practical attitude should 
  be adopted. For it is one thing to recognize that something is inevitable, and 
  quite another to put oneself in the service of that inevitability&#8221; (Finanzkapital). 
  Those who failed to realize that for Marx and for the revolutionary proletariat 
  unitary historical thought was in no way distinct from a practical attitude 
  to be adopted generally ended up becoming victims of the practice they did adopt. 
</p>
<p class="subtitle">96</p><p>

  The ideology of the social-democratic organizations put those organizations 
  under the control of the professors who were educating the working class, and 
  their organizational forms corresponded to this type of passive apprenticeship. 
  The participation of the socialists of the Second International in political 
  and economic struggles was admittedly concrete, but it was profoundly uncritical. 
  It was a manifestly reformist practice carried on in the name of an illusory 
  revolutionism. This ideology of revolution inevitably foundered on the very 
  successes of those who proclaimed it. The elevation of socialist journalists 
  and parliamentary representatives above the rest of the movement encouraged 
  them to become habituated to a bourgeois lifestyle (most of them had in any 
  case been recruited from the bourgeois intelligentsia). And even industrial 
  workers who had been recruited out of struggles in the factories were transformed 
  by the trade-union bureaucracy into brokers of labor-power, whose task was to 
  make sure that that commodity was sold at a &#8220;fair&#8221; price. For the 
  activity of all these people to have retained any appearance of being revolutionary, 
  capitalism would have had to have turned out to be conveniently incapable of 
  tolerating this economic reformism, despite the fact that it had no trouble 
  tolerating the legalistic political expressions of the same reformism. The social 
  democrats&#8217; scientific ideology confidently affirmed that capitalism could 
  not tolerate these economic antagonisms; but history repeatedly proved them 
  wrong. </p>
<p class="subtitle">97</p><p>

  Bernstein, the social democrat least attached to political ideology and most 
  openly attached to the methodology of bourgeois science, was honest enough to 
  point out this contradiction (a contradiction which had also been implied by 
  the reformist movement of the English workers, who never bothered to invoke 
  any revolutionary ideology). But it was historical development itself which 
  ultimately provided the definitive demonstration. Although full of illusions 
  in other regards, Bernstein had denied that a crisis of capitalist production 
  would miraculously force the hand of the socialists, who wanted to inherit the 
  revolution only by way of this orthodox sequence of events. The profound social 
  upheaval touched off by World War I, though it led to a widespread awakening 
  of radical consciousness, twice demonstrated that the social-democratic hierarchy 
  had failed to provide the German workers with a revolutionary education capable 
  of turning them into theorists: first, when the overwhelming majority of the 
  party rallied to the imperialist war; then, following the German defeat, when 
  the party crushed the Spartakist revolutionaries. The ex-worker Ebert, who had 
  become one of the social-democratic leaders, apparently still believed in sin 
  since he admitted that he hated revolution &#8220;like sin.&#8221; And he proved 
  himself a fitting precursor of the socialist representation that was soon to 
  emerge as the mortal enemy of the proletariat in Russia and elsewhere, when 
  he accurately summed up the essence of this new form of alienation: &#8220;Socialism 
  means working a lot.&#8221; </p>
<p class="subtitle">98</p><p>

  As a Marxist thinker, Lenin was simply a faithful and consistent Kautskyist 
  who applied the revolutionary ideology of &#8220;orthodox Marxism&#8221; within 
  the conditions existing in Russia, conditions which did not lend themselves 
  to the reformist practice carried on elsewhere by the Second International. 
  In the Russian context, the Bolshevik practice of directing the proletariat 
  from outside, by means of a disciplined underground party under the control 
  of intellectuals who had become &#8220;professional revolutionaries,&#8221; 
  became a new profession &#8212; a profession which refused to come to terms 
  with any of the professional ruling strata of capitalist society (the Czarist 
  political regime was in any case incapable of offering any opportunities for 
  such compromise, which depends on an advanced stage of bourgeois power). As 
  a result of this intransigence, the Bolsheviks ended up becoming the sole practitioners 
  of the profession of totalitarian social domination. </p>
<p class="subtitle">99</p><p>

  With the war and the collapse of international social democracy in the face 
  of that war, the authoritarian ideological radicalism of the Bolsheviks was 
  able to spread its influence all over the world. The bloody end of the democratic 
  illusions of the workers movement transformed the entire world into a Russia, 
  and Bolshevism, reigning over the first revolutionary breakthrough engendered 
  by this period of crisis, offered its hierarchical and ideological model to 
  the proletariat of all countries, urging them to adopt it in order to &#8220;speak 
  Russian&#8221; to their own ruling classes. Lenin did not reproach the Marxism 
  of the Second International for being a revolutionary ideology, but for ceasing 
  to be a revolutionary ideology. </p>
<p class="subtitle">100</p><p>

  The historical moment when Bolshevism triumphed for itself in Russia and social 
  democracy fought victoriously for the old world marks the inauguration of the 
  state of affairs that is at the heart of the modern spectacle&#8217;s domination: 
  the representation of the working class has become an enemy of the working class. 
  </p>
<p class="subtitle">101</p><p>

  &#8220;In all previous revolutions,&#8221; wrote Rosa Luxemburg in Die Rote 
  Fahne of 21 December 1918, &#8220;the combatants faced each other openly and 
  directly &#8212; class against class, program against program. In the present 
  revolution, the troops protecting the old order are not fighting under the insignia 
  of the ruling class, but under the banner of a &#8216;social-democratic party.&#8217; 
  If the central question of revolution was posed openly and honestly &#8212; 
  Capitalism or socialism? &#8212; the great mass of the proletariat would today 
  have no doubts or hesitations.&#8221; Thus, a few days before its destruction, 
  the radical current of the German proletariat discovered the secret of the new 
  conditions engendered by the whole process that had gone before (a development 
  to which the representation of the working class had greatly contributed): the 
  spectacular organization of the ruling order&#8217;s defense, the social reign 
  of appearances where no &#8220;central question&#8221; can any longer be posed 
  &#8220;openly and honestly.&#8221; The revolutionary representation of the proletariat 
  had at this stage become both the primary cause and the central result of the 
  general falsification of society. </p>
<p class="subtitle">102</p><p>

  The organization of the proletariat in accordance with the Bolshevik model resulted 
  from the backwardness of Russia and from the abandonment of revolutionary struggle 
  by the workers movements of the advanced countries. These same backward conditions 
  also tended to foster the counterrevolutionary aspects which that form of organization 
  had unconsciously contained from its inception. The repeated failure of the 
  mass of the European workers movement to take advantage of the golden opportunities 
  of the 1918-1920 period (a failure which included the violent destruction of 
  its own radical minority) favored the consolidation of the Bolshevik development 
  and enabled that fraudulent outcome to present itself to the world as the only 
  possible proletarian solution. By seizing a state monopoly as sole representative 
  and defender of working-class power, the Bolshevik Party justified itself and 
  became what it already was: the party of the owners of the proletariat, owners 
  who essentially eliminated earlier forms of property. </p>
<p class="subtitle">103</p><p>

  For twenty years the various tendencies of Russian social democracy had engaged 
  in an unresolved debate over all the conditions that might bear on the overthrow 
  of Czarism &#8212; the weakness of the bourgeoisie; the preponderance of the 
  peasant majority; and the potentially decisive role of a proletariat which was 
  concentrated and combative but which constituted only a small minority of the 
  population. This debate was eventually resolved in practice by a factor that 
  had not figured in any of the hypotheses: a revolutionary bureaucracy that placed 
  itself at the head of the proletariat, seized state power, and proceeded to 
  impose a new form of class domination. A strictly bourgeois revolution had been 
  impossible; talk of a &#8220;democratic dictatorship of workers and peasants&#8221; 
  was meaningless verbiage; and the proletarian power of the soviets could not 
  simultaneously maintain itself against the class of small landowners, against 
  the national and international White reaction, and against its own representation 
  which had become externalized and alienated in the form of a working-class party 
  that maintained total control over the state, the economy, the means of expression, 
  and soon even over people&#8217;s thoughts. Trotsky&#8217;s and Parvus&#8217;s 
  theory of permanent revolution, which Lenin adopted in April 1917, was the only 
  theory that proved true for countries with underdeveloped bourgeoisies; but 
  even there it became true only after the unknown factor of bureaucratic class 
  power came into the picture. In the numerous arguments within the Bolshevik 
  leadership, Lenin was the most consistent advocate of concentrating dictatorial 
  power in the hands of this supreme ideological representation. Lenin was right 
  every time in the sense that he invariably supported the solution implied by 
  earlier choices of the minority that now exercised absolute power: the democracy 
  that was kept from peasants by means of the state would have to be kept from 
  workers as well, which led to denying it to Communist union leaders and to party 
  members in general, and finally to the highest ranks of the party hierarchy. 
  At the Tenth Congress, as the Kronstadt soviet was being crushed by arms and 
  buried under a barrage of slander, Lenin attacked the radical bureaucrats who 
  had formed a &#8220;Workers&#8217; Opposition&#8221; faction with the following 
  ultimatum, the logic of which Stalin would later extend to an absolute division 
  of the world: &#8220;You can stand here with us, or against us out there with 
  a gun in your hand, but not within some opposition. . . . We&#8217;ve had enough 
  opposition.&#8221; </p>
<p class="subtitle">104</p><p>

  After Kronstadt, the bureaucracy consolidated its power as sole owner of a system 
  of state capitalism &#8212; internally by means of a temporary alliance with 
  the peasantry (the &#8220;New Economic Policy&#8221;) and externally by using 
  the workers regimented into the bureaucratic parties of the Third International 
  as a backup force for Russian diplomacy, sabotaging the entire revolutionary 
  movement and supporting bourgeois governments whose support it in turn hoped 
  to secure in the sphere of international politics (the Kuomintang regime in 
  the China of 1925-27, the Popular Fronts in Spain and France, etc.). The Russian 
  bureaucracy then carried this consolidation of power to the next stage by subjecting 
  the peasantry to a reign of terror, implementing the most brutal primitive accumulation 
  of capital in history. The industrialization of the Stalin era revealed the 
  bureaucracy&#8217;s ultimate function: continuing the reign of the economy by 
  preserving the essence of market society: commodified labor. It also demonstrated 
  the independence of the economy: the economy has come to dominate society so 
  completely that it has proved capable of recreating the class domination it 
  needs for its own continued operation; that is, the bourgeoisie has created 
  an independent power that is capable of maintaining itself even without a bourgeoisie. 
  The totalitarian bureaucracy was not &#8220;the last owning class in history&#8221; 
  in Bruno Rizzi&#8217;s sense; it was merely a substitute ruling class for the 
  commodity economy. A tottering capitalist property system was replaced by a 
  cruder version of itself &#8212; simplified, less diversified, and concentrated 
  as the collective property of the bureaucratic class. This underdeveloped type 
  of ruling class is also a reflection of economic underdevelopment, and it has 
  no agenda beyond overcoming this underdevelopment in certain regions of the 
  world. The hierarchical and statist framework for this crude remake of the capitalist 
  ruling class was provided by the working-class party, which was itself modeled 
  on the hierarchical separations of bourgeois organizations. As Ante Ciliga noted 
  while in one of Stalin&#8217;s prisons, &#8220;Technical questions of organization 
  turned out to be social questions&#8221; (Lenin and the Revolution). </p>
<p class="subtitle">105</p><p>

  Leninism was the highest voluntaristic expression of revolutionary ideology; 
  it was a coherence of the separate, governing a reality that resisted it. With 
  the advent of Stalinism, revolutionary ideology returned to its fundamental 
  incoherence. At that point, ideology was no longer a weapon, it had become an 
  end in itself. But a lie that can no longer be challenged becomes insane. The 
  totalitarian ideological pronouncement obliterates reality as well as purpose; 
  nothing exists but what it says exists. Although this crude form of the spectacle 
  has been confined to certain underdeveloped regions, it has nevertheless played 
  an essential role in the spectacle&#8217;s global development. This particular 
  materialization of ideology did not transform the world economically, as did 
  advanced capitalism; it simply used police-state methods to transform people&#8217;s 
  perception of the world. </p>
<p class="subtitle">106</p><p>

  The ruling totalitarian-ideological class is the ruler of a world turned upside 
  down. The more powerful the class, the more it claims not to exist, and its 
  power is employed above all to enforce this claim. It is modest only on this 
  one point, however, because this officially nonexistent bureaucracy simultaneously 
  attributes the crowning achievements of history to its own infallible leadership. 
  Though its existence is everywhere in evidence, the bureaucracy must be invisible 
  as a class. As a result, all social life becomes insane. The social organization 
  of total falsehood stems from this fundamental contradiction. </p>
<p class="subtitle">107</p><p>

  Stalinism was also a reign of terror within the bureaucratic class. The terrorism 
  on which this class&#8217;s power was based inevitably came to strike the class 
  itself, because this class had no juridical legitimacy, no legally recognized 
  status as an owning class which could be extended to each of its members. Its 
  ownership had to be masked because it was based on false consciousness. This 
  false consciousness can maintain its total power only by means of a total reign 
  of terror in which all real motives are ultimately obscured. The members of 
  the ruling bureaucratic class have the right of ownership over society only 
  collectively, as participants in a fundamental lie: they have to play the role 
  of the proletariat governing a socialist society; they have to be actors faithful 
  to a script of ideological betrayal. Yet they cannot actually participate in 
  this counterfeit entity unless their legitimacy is validated. No bureaucrat 
  can individually assert his right to power, because to prove himself a socialist 
  proletarian he would have to demonstrate that he was the opposite of a bureaucrat, 
  while to prove himself a bureaucrat is impossible because the bureaucracy&#8217;s 
  official line is that there is no bureaucracy. Each bureaucrat is thus totally 
  dependent on the central seal of legitimacy provided by the ruling ideology, 
  which validates the collective participation in its &#8220;socialist regime&#8221; 
  of all the bureaucrats it does not liquidate. Although the bureaucrats are collectively 
  empowered to make all social decisions, the cohesion of their own class can 
  be ensured only by the concentration of their terrorist power in a single person. 
  In this person resides the only practical truth of the ruling lie: the power 
  to determine an unchallengeable boundary line which is nevertheless constantly 
  being adjusted. Stalin decides without appeal who is and who is not a member 
  of the ruling bureaucracy &#8212; who should be considered a &#8220;proletarian 
  in power&#8221; and who branded &#8220;a traitor in the pay of Wall Street and 
  the Mikado.&#8221; The atomized bureaucrats can find their collective legitimacy 
  only in the person of Stalin &#8212; the lord of the world who thus comes to 
  see himself as the absolute person, for whom no superior spirit exists. &#8220;The 
  lord of the world recognizes his own nature &#8212; omnipresent power &#8212; 
  through the destructive violence he exerts against the contrastingly powerless 
  selfhood of his subjects.&#8221; He is the power that defines the terrain of 
  domination, and he is also &#8220;the power that ravages that terrain.&#8221; 
 </p>
<p class="subtitle">108</p><p>

  When ideology has become total through its possession of total power, and has 
  changed from partial truth to totalitarian falsehood, historical thought has 
  been so totally annihilated that history itself, even at the level of the most 
  empirical knowledge, can no longer exist. Totalitarian bureaucratic society 
  lives in a perpetual present in which whatever has previously happened is determined 
  solely by its police. The project already envisioned by Napoleon of &#8220;monarchically 
  controlling memory&#8221; has been realized in Stalinism&#8217;s constant rewriting 
  of the past, which alters not only the interpretations of past events but even 
  the events themselves. But the price paid for this liberation from all historical 
  reality is the loss of the rational frame of reference that is indispensable 
  to capitalism as a historical social system. It is well known how much the scientific 
  application of an ideology gone mad has cost the Russian economy (one need only 
  recall the Lysenko fiasco). This contradiction &#8212; the fact that a totalitarian 
  bureaucracy trying to administer an industrialized society is caught between 
  its need for rationality and its repression of rationality &#8212; is also one 
  of its main weaknesses in comparison with normal capitalist development. Just 
  as the bureaucracy cannot resolve the question of agriculture as ordinary capitalism 
  has done, it also proves inferior to the latter in the field of industrial production, 
  because its unrealistic authoritarian planning is based on omnipresent falsifications. 
  </p>
<p class="subtitle">109</p><p>

  Between the two world wars the revolutionary working-class movement was destroyed 
  by the joint action of the Stalinist bureaucracy and of fascist totalitarianism 
  (the latter&#8217;s organizational form having been inspired by the totalitarian 
  party that had first been tested and developed in Russia). Fascism was a desperate 
  attempt to defend the bourgeois economy from the dual threat of crisis and proletarian 
  subversion, a state of siege in which capitalist society saved itself by giving 
  itself an emergency dose of rationalization in the form of massive state intervention. 
  But this rationalization is hampered by the extreme irrationality of its methods. 
  Although fascism rallies to the defense of the main icons of a bourgeois ideology 
  that has become conservative (family, private property, moral order, patriotism), 
  while mobilizing the petty bourgeoisie and the unemployed workers who are panic-stricken 
  by economic crisis or disillusioned by the socialist movement&#8217;s failure 
  to bring about a revolution, it is not itself fundamentally ideological. It 
  presents itself as what it is &#8212; a violent resurrection of myth calling 
  for participation in a community defined by archaic pseudovalues: race, blood, 
  leader. Fascism is a technologically equipped primitivism. Its factitious mythological 
  rehashes are presented in the spectacular context of the most modern means of 
  conditioning and illusion. It is thus a significant factor in the formation 
  of the modern spectacle, and its role in the destruction of the old working-class 
  movement also makes it one of the founding forces of present-day society. But 
  since it is also the most costly method of preserving the capitalist order, 
  it has generally ended up being replaced by the major capitalist states, which 
  represent stronger and more rational forms of that order. </p>
<p class="subtitle">110</p><p>

  When the Russian bureaucracy has finally succeeded in doing away with the vestiges 
  of bourgeois property that hampered its rule over the economy, and in developing 
  this economy for its own purposes, and in being recognized as a member of the 
  club of great powers, it wants to enjoy its world in peace and to disencumber 
  itself from the arbitrariness to which it is still subjected. It thus denounces 
  the Stalinism at its origin. But this denunciation remains Stalinist &#8212; 
  arbitrary, unexplained, and subject to continual modification &#8212; because 
  the ideological lie at its origin can never be revealed. The bureaucracy cannot 
  liberalize itself either culturally or politically because its existence as 
  a class depends on its ideological monopoly, which, for all its cumbersomeness, 
  is its sole title to power. This ideology has lost the passion of its original 
  expression, but its passionless routinization still has the repressive function 
  of controlling all thought and prohibiting any competition whatsoever. The bureaucracy 
  is thus helplessly tied to an ideology that is no longer believed by anyone. 
  The power that used to inspire terror now inspires ridicule, but this ridiculed 
  power still defends itself with the threat of resorting to the terrorizing force 
  it would like to be rid of. Thus, at the very time when the bureaucracy hopes 
  to demonstrate its superiority on the terrain of capitalism it reveals itself 
  to be a poor cousin of capitalism. Just as its actual history contradicts its 
  fa&ccedil;ade of legality and its crudely maintained ignorance contradicts its 
  scientific pretensions, so its attempt to vie with the bourgeoisie in the production 
  of commodity abundance is stymied by the fact that such abundance contains its 
  own implicit ideology, and is generally accompanied by the freedom to choose 
  from an unlimited range of spectacular pseudoalternatives &#8212; a pseudofreedom 
  that remains incompatible with the bureaucracy&#8217;s ideology. </p>
<p class="subtitle">111</p><p>

  The bureaucracy&#8217;s ideological title to power is already collapsing at 
  the international level. The power that established itself nationally in the 
  name of an ostensibly internationalist perspective is now forced to recognize 
  that it can no longer impose its system of lies beyond its own national borders. 
  The unequal economic development of diverse bureaucracies with competing interests 
  that have succeeded in establishing their own &#8220;socialism&#8221; in more 
  than one country has led to an all-out public confrontation between the Russian 
  lie and the Chinese lie. From this point on, each bureaucracy in power will 
  have to find its own way; and the same is true for each of the totalitarian 
  parties aspiring to such power (notably those that still survive from the Stalinist 
  period among certain national working classes). This international collapse 
  has been further aggravated by the expressions of internal negation which first 
  became visible to the outside world when the workers of East Berlin revolted 
  against the bureaucrats and demanded a &#8220;government of steel workers&#8221; 
  &#8212; a negation which has in one case already gone to the point of sovereign 
  workers councils in Hungary. But in the final analysis, this crumbling of the 
  global alliance of pseudosocialist bureaucracies is also a most unfavorable 
  development for the future of capitalist society. The bourgeoisie is in the 
  process of losing the adversary that objectively supported it by providing an 
  illusory unification of all opposition to the existing order. This division 
  of labor between two mutually reinforcing forms of the spectacle comes to an 
  end when the pseudorevolutionary role in turn divides. The spectacular component 
  of the destruction of the worker-class movement is itself headed for destruction. 
  </p>
<p class="subtitle">112</p><p>

  The only current partisans of the Leninist illusion are the various Trotskyist 
  tendencies, which stubbornly persist in identifying the proletarian project 
  with an ideologically based hierarchical organization despite all the historical 
  experiences that have refuted that perspective. The distance that separates 
  Trotskyism from a revolutionary critique of present-day society is related to 
  the deferential distance the Trotskyists maintain regarding positions that were 
  already mistaken when they were acted on in real struggles. Trotsky remained 
  fundamentally loyal to the upper bureaucracy until 1927, while striving to gain 
  control of it so as to make it resume a genuinely Bolshevik foreign policy. 
  (It is well known, for example, that in order to help conceal Lenin&#8217;s 
  famous &#8220;Testament&#8221; he went so far as to slanderously disavow his 
  own supporter Max Eastman, who had made it public.) Trotsky was doomed by his 
  basic perspective, because once the bureaucracy became aware that it had evolved 
  into a counterrevolutionary class on the domestic front, it was bound to opt 
  for a similarly counterrevolutionary role in other countries (though still, 
  of course, in the name of revolution). Trotsky&#8217;s subsequent efforts to 
  create a Fourth International reflect the same inconsistency. Once he had become 
  an unconditional partisan of the Bolshevik form of organization (which he did 
  during the second Russian revolution), he refused for the rest of his life to 
  recognize that the bureaucracy was a new ruling class. When Luk&aacute;cs, in 
  1923, presented this same organizational form as the long-sought link between 
  theory and practice, in which proletarians cease being mere &#8220;spectators&#8221; 
  of the events that occur in their organization and begin consciously choosing 
  and experiencing those events, he was describing as merits of the Bolshevik 
  Party everything that that party was not. Despite his profound theoretical work, 
  Luk&aacute;cs remained an ideologue, speaking in the name of the power that 
  was most grossly alien to the proletarian movement, yet believing and giving 
  his audience to believe that he found himself completely at home with it. As 
  subsequent events demonstrated how that power disavows and suppresses its lackeys, 
  Luk&aacute;cs&#8217;s endless self-repudiations revealed with caricatural clarity 
  that he had identified with the total opposite of himself and of everything 
  he had argued for in History and Class Consciousness. No one better than Luk&aacute;cs 
  illustrates the validity of the fundamental rule for assessing all the intellectuals 
  of this century: What they respect is a precise gauge of their own degradation. 
  Yet Lenin had hardly encouraged these sorts of illusions about his activities. 
  On the contrary, he acknowledged that &#8220;a political party cannot examine 
  its members to see if there are contradictions between their philosophy and 
  the party program.&#8221; The party whose idealized portrait Luk&aacute;cs had 
  so inopportunely drawn was in reality suited for only one very specific and 
  limited task: the seizure of state power. </p>
<p class="subtitle">113</p><p>

  Since the neo-Leninist illusion carried on by present-day Trotskyism is constantly 
  being contradicted by the reality of modern capitalist societies (both bourgeois 
  and bureaucratic), it is not surprising that it gets its most favorable reception 
  in the nominally independent &#8220;underdeveloped&#8221; countries, where the 
  local ruling classes&#8217; versions of bureaucratic state socialism end up 
  amounting to little more than a mere ideology of economic development. The hybrid 
  composition of these ruling classes is more or less clearly related to their 
  position within the bourgeois-bureaucratic spectrum. Their international maneuvering 
  between those two poles of capitalist power, along with their numerous ideological 
  compromises (notably with Islam) stemming from their heterogeneous social bases, 
  end up removing from these degraded versions of ideological socialism everything 
  serious except the police. One type of bureaucracy establishes itself by forging 
  an organization capable of combining national struggle with agrarian peasant 
  revolt; it then, as in China, tends to apply the Stalinist model of industrialization 
  in societies that are even less developed than Russia was in 1917. A bureaucracy 
  able to industrialize the nation may also develop out of the petty bourgeoisie, 
  with power being seized by army officers, as happened in Egypt. In other situations, 
  such as the aftermath of the Algerian war of independence, a bureaucracy that 
  has established itself as a para-state authority in the course of struggle may 
  seek a stabilizing compromise by merging with a weak national bourgeoisie. Finally, 
  in the former colonies of black Africa that remain openly tied to the American 
  and European bourgeoisie, a local bourgeoisie constitutes itself (usually based 
  on the power of traditional tribal chiefs) through its possession of the state. 
  Foreign imperialism remains the real master of the economy of these countries, 
  but at a certain stage its native agents are rewarded for their sale of local 
  products by being granted possession of a local state &#8212; a state that is 
  independent from the local masses but not from imperialism. Incapable of accumulating 
  capital, this artificial bourgeoisie does nothing but squander the surplus value 
  it extracts from local labor and the subsidies it receives from protector states 
  and international monopolies. Because of the obvious inability of these bourgeois 
  classes to fulfill the normal economic functions of a bourgeoisie, they soon 
  find themselves challenged by oppositional movements based on the bureaucratic 
  model (more or less adapted to particular local conditions). But if such bureaucracies 
  succeed in their fundamental project of industrialization, they produce the 
  historical conditions for their own defeat: by accumulating capital they also 
  accumulate a proletariat, thus creating their own negation in countries where 
  that negation had not previously existed. </p>
<p class="subtitle">114</p><p>

  In the course of this complex and terrible evolution which has brought the era 
  of class struggles to a new set of conditions, the proletariat of the industrial 
  countries has lost its ability to assert its own independent perspective. In 
  a fundamental sense, it has also lost its illusions. But it has not lost its 
  being. The proletariat has not been eliminated. It remains irreducibly present 
  within the intensified alienation of modern capitalism. It consists of that 
  vast majority of workers who have lost all power over their lives and who, once 
  they become aware of this, redefine themselves as the proletariat, the force 
  working to negate this society from within. This proletariat is being objectively 
  reinforced by the virtual elimination of the peasantry and by the increasing 
  degree to which the &#8220;service&#8221; sectors and intellectual professions 
  are being subjected to factorylike working conditions. Subjectively, however, 
  this proletariat is still far removed from any practical class consciousness, 
  and this goes not only for white-collar workers but also for blue-collar workers, 
  who have yet to become aware of any perspective beyond the impotence and mystifications 
  of the old politics. But when the proletariat discovers that its own externalized 
  power contributes to the constant reinforcement of capitalist society, no longer 
  only in the form of its alienated labor but also in the form of the trade unions, 
  political parties, and state powers that it had created in the effort to liberate 
  itself, it also discovers through concrete historical experience that it is 
  the class that must totally oppose all rigidified externalizations and all specializations 
  of power. It bears a revolution that cannot leave anything outside itself, a 
  revolution embodying the permanent domination of the present over the past and 
  a total critique of separation; and it must discover the appropriate forms of 
  action to carry out this revolution. No quantitative amelioration of its impoverishment, 
  no illusory participation in a hierarchized system, can provide a lasting cure 
  for its dissatisfaction, because the proletariat cannot truly recognize itself 
  in any particular wrong it has suffered, nor in the righting of any particular 
  wrong. It cannot recognize itself even in the righting of many such wrongs, 
  but only in the righting of the absolute wrong of being excluded from any real 
  life. </p>
<p class="subtitle">115</p><p>

  New signs of negation are proliferating in the most economically advanced countries. 
  Although these signs are misunderstood and falsified by the spectacle, they 
  are sufficient proof that a new period has begun. We have already seen the failure 
  of the first proletarian assault against capitalism; now we are witnessing the 
  failure of capitalist abundance. On one hand, anti-union struggles of Western 
  workers are being repressed first of all by the unions; on the other, rebellious 
  youth are raising new protests, protests which are still vague and confused 
  but which clearly imply a rejection of art, of everyday life, and of the old 
  specialized politics. These are two sides of a new spontaneous struggle that 
  is at first taking on a criminal appearance. They foreshadow a second proletarian 
  assault against class society. As the lost children of this as yet immobile 
  army reappear on this battleground &#8212; a battleground which has changed 
  and yet remains the same &#8212; they are following a new &#8220;General Ludd&#8221; 
  who, this time, urges them to attack the machinery of permitted consumption.

  &#8220;The long-sought political form through which the working class could 
  carry out its own economic liberation&#8221; has taken on a clear shape in this 
  century, in the form of revolutionary workers councils which assume all decisionmaking 
  and executive powers and which federate with each other by means of delegates 
  who are answerable to their base and revocable at any moment. The councils that 
  have actually emerged have as yet provided no more than a rough hint of their 
  possibilities because they have immediately been opposed and defeated by class 
  society&#8217;s various defensive forces, among which their own false consciousness 
  must often be included. As Pannekoek rightly stressed, opting for the power 
  of workers councils &#8220;poses problems&#8221; rather than providing a solution. 
  But it is precisely within this form of social organization that the problems 
  of proletarian revolution can find their real solution. This is the terrain 
  where the objective preconditions of historical consciousness are brought together 
  &#8212; the terrain where active direct communication is realized, marking the 
  end of specialization, hierarchy and separation, and the transformation of existing 
  conditions into &#8220;conditions of unity.&#8221; In this process proletarian 
  subjects can emerge from their struggle against their contemplative position; 
  their consciousness is equal to the practical organization they have chosen 
  for themselves because this consciousness has become inseparable from coherent 
  intervention in history. <p class="subtitle">117</p><p>
  With the power of the councils &#8212; a power that must internationally supplant 
  all other forms of power &#8212; the proletarian movement becomes its own product. 
  This product is nothing other than the producers themselves, whose goal has 
  become nothing other than their own fulfillment. Only in this way can the spectacle&#8217;s 
  negation of life be negated in its turn. <p class="subtitle">118</p><p>
  The appearance of workers councils during the first quarter of this century 
  was the most advanced expression of the old proletarian movement, but it went 
  unnoticed, except in travestied forms, because it was repressed and destroyed 
  along with all the rest of the movement. Now, from the vantage point of the 
  new stage of proletarian critique, the councils can be seen in their true light 
  as the only undefeated aspect of a defeated movement. The historical consciousness 
  that recognizes that the councils are the only terrain in which it can thrive 
  can now see that they are no longer at the periphery of a movement that is subsiding, 
  but at the center of a movement that is rising. <p class="subtitle">119</p><p>
  A revolutionary organization that exists before the establishment of the power 
  of workers councils must discover its own appropriate form through struggle; 
  but all these historical experiences have already made it clear that it cannot 
  claim to represent the working class. Its task, rather, is to embody a radical 
  separation from the world of separation. <p class="subtitle">120</p><p>
  Revolutionary organization is the coherent expression of the theory of praxis 
  entering into two-way communication with practical struggles, in the process 
  of becoming practical theory. Its own practice is to foster the communication 
  and coherence of these struggles. At the revolutionary moment when social separations 
  are dissolved, the organization must dissolve itself as a separate organization. 
  <p class="subtitle">121</p><p>
  A revolutionary organization must constitute an integral critique of society, 
  that is, it must make a comprehensive critique of all aspects of alienated social 
  life while refusing to compromise with any form of separate power anywhere in 
  the world. In the organization&#8217;s struggle with class society, the combattants 
  themselves are the fundamental weapons: a revolutionary organization must thus 
  see to it that the dominant society&#8217;s conditions of separation and hierarchy 
  are not reproduced within itself. It must constantly struggle against its deformation 
  by the ruling spectacle. The only limit to participation in its total democracy 
  is that each of its members must have recognized and appropriated the coherence 
  of the organization&#8217;s critique &#8212; a coherence that must be demonstrated 
  both in the critical theory as such and in the relation between that theory 
  and practical activity.<p class="subtitle">122</p><p>
  As capitalism&#8217;s ever-intensifying imposition of alienation at all levels 
  makes it increasingly hard for workers to recognize and name their own impoverishment, 
  putting them in the position of having to reject that impoverishment in its 
  totality or not at all, revolutionary organization has had to learn that it 
  can no longer combat alienation by means of alienated forms of struggle. <p class="subtitle">123</p><p>
  Proletarian revolution depends entirely on the condition that, for the first 
  time, theory as understanding of human practice be recognized and lived by the 
  masses. It requires that workers become dialecticians and put their thought 
  into practice. It thus demands of its &#8220;people without qualities&#8221; 
  more than the bourgeois revolution demanded of the qualified individuals it 
  delegated to carry out its tasks (because the partial ideological consciousness 
  created by a segment of the bourgeois class was based on the economy, that central 
  part of social life in which that class was already in power). The development 
  of class society to the stage of the spectacular organization of nonlife is 
  thus leading the revolutionary project to become visibly what it has always 
  been in essence. <p class="subtitle">124</p><p>
  Revolutionary theory is now the enemy of all revolutionary ideology, and it 
  knows it.
