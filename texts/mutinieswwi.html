<p class="title">MUTINIES</p>
 <p class="author">by Dave Lamb (Solidarity)</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Helvetica"><strong>INTRODUCTION</strong><br>
  <br>
  <em>&quot;Our experience accustoms us to seeing how at a word of command a mass 
  of soldiers will enter into an organised fury of carnage and into the lottery 
  of life and death, and how at another command they will again become peaceful. 
  The same thing is required of a people that has armed itself. Here the word 
  of command is liberty, the enemy tyranny. . . But there is a great difference 
  between the passivity of ordinary military obedience and the ardour of an insurrection: 
  between obedience to the order of a general and the flame of enthusiasm which 
  liberty pours into the vein of every creature. . These efforts are the enjoyment 
  of liberty, and you wish it to be renounced; these occupations, this activity 
  is for the public cause, this interest is the driving force, and you want the 
  people to sink into inertia and boredom once more.&quot; </em><br>
  <br>
  G.W.F. Hegel (1) <br>
  <br>
  These words were written a hundred years before the 1914-1918 war, yet they 
  capture the sentiments of the forgotten men and women of that period who decided 
  to take a hand in their own destiny. Hegel drew attention to the timeless urge 
  to self-determination and to the joy which accompanies a victory of mutineers 
  or insurrectionists over tyrants, bureaucrats, manipulators, and sanguinary 
  generals. In the following pages I have tried to uncover some of the conveniently 
  forgotten moments of freedom which flowered in the shadow of total war. <br>
  <br>
  Between 1917 and 1919 a series of mutinies took place amongst the world's most 
  disciplined armies. The Russian, German, Italian and French forces as well as 
  the British all 'suffered' major outbreaks. Yet many of these events have virtually 
  been ignored by historians of both right and left-wing persuasions. Mutinies, 
  like heath fires, burst our here and there and as such are inexplicable to those 
  whose criterion for revolutionary activity is that it should be bound up with 
  a clearly defined goal and with a strategy, usually embodied in a revolutionary 
  leadership. Accordingly an outbreak of autonomous activity is seen by the leadership 
  fetishists to be purposeless and mindless. Marx was speaking for future Fabians 
  and Leninists when he said: <br>
  <br>
  'A motley crew of mutineering soldiers who have murdered their officers, torn 
  asunder the ties of discipline, and not succeeded in discovering a man on whom 
  to bestow supreme command are certainly the body least likely to organise a 
  serious and protracted resistance.' (2) There is here a conception of social 
  change as an orderly, disciplined activity. This conception is reflected in 
  the tendency of both Leninists and Fabians to see themselves as the elite officer 
  corps, imparting their will on the direction of social change. It is difficult 
  to see from this standpoint how people might have aims and aspirations of their 
  own, which are not always comprehensible to their self-appointed leaders. <br>
  <br>
  One of the reasons why mutinies are largely ignored is because most historians 
  tend to see the aims and objectives of the masses through the eyes of leaders 
  or institutions that claim to represent popular interests. In this way the problems 
  of the leaders become the problems of the class. Lenin's problems in 1917 become 
  those of Russian workers. The problems facing the TUC become those of the British 
  working class. In this perspective the mutinies in the Russian Army of 1917 
  are important insofar as they furthered Lenin's objectives. Mutinies in the 
  British armies are deemed relatively insignificant because they were not subordinated 
  to some external movement. <br>
  <br>
  That ordinary men and women might have their own goals is conveniently ignored 
  by historians whose vision is restricted to the ambitions and strategies of 
  those in power or seeking to achieve it. This, to a certain extent, is understandable 
  since the historian is very much at the mercy of his sources (press reports, 
  autobiographies, and institutional minutes are usually the expression of the 
  point of view of those who have made them). It is easy to deal with the memoirs 
  of a Haig, a Petain or a Ludendorff. Conversely, it is 'uninteresting' and difficult 
  to record the aspirations of those millions of Russians who collectively destroyed 
  centuries of Tsardom because of their decision to return home, and their willingness 
  to disobey and even kill their officers in the process. <br>
  <br>
  We are living in an age where the aspirations of the collective are unable to 
  find expression; the medium for such expression is limited to the individualistic 
  categories of the bourgeois epoch. A sometimes all-too-willing victim of his 
  medium, the historian tends to look at mass autonomous movements through the 
  eyes of those who seek to direct the process, the spokespersons, the revolutionary 
  generals, the political programmes and revolutionary textbooks. The historian 
  looks to those who have staked their claim to impose their will upon human history. 
  And in so doing those countless millions struggling for some control over their 
  destiny are largely ignored. We can perceive why governments and military authorities 
  have concealed information about mutinies. We can equally understand why those 
  countless hacks who write history in order to justify the status quo do not 
  demand the release of information. But why has this area been neglected by allegedly 
  left-wing historians? Could it be that what happened ran counter to the presuppositions 
  of both Fabians and Leninists that meaningful activity could only be envisaged 
  in relation to some structure of authority? The mutinies in the United Kingdom 
  did not throw up any such permanent structures and, for this reason, have been 
  ignored by those who see social change as dominated by permanent institutions 
  led by experts whose interests are antagonistic to autonomous mass activity. 
  <br>
  <br>
  A concentration on leadership strategies can blind one to some of the most powerful 
  forces in history. For example, did the American government's decision to pull 
  out of Vietnam arise out of the wily schemes of Richard Nixon? Were the Americans 
  out-manoeuvred at the negotiating table? Perhaps it was the brilliant strategy 
  of the North Vietnamese generals? Historians will grow fat on their published 
  ponderings over these issues. But what about the fact that hundreds of thousands 
  of GI's could no longer be relied upon? No one organised them. They left no 
  permanent structures behind, yet their resistance had a profound effect on world 
  history. It might be said that they were acting in the interests of 'world communism' 
  but hardly one of them would accept this as an explicit motive. They just wanted 
  to go home. <br>
  <br>
  The following pages are an account of mutinies which occurred among UK and Commonwealth 
  troops. There will be no attempt to impute any motives other than those put 
  forward at the time by the participants themselves. <br>
  <br>
  Perhaps the most significant factor in this sadly neglected chapter in working 
  class history is the emergence of equalitarian tendencies, unstinting self-sacrifice 
  and loyalty to one's comrades under conditions capable of bringing out the worst 
  in men. A mutiny against arbitrary authority provokes situations where class 
  loyalties are put to the severest test. If properly understood the mutinies 
  within the armed forces during the First World War will stand as one of the 
  great landmarks of working class history. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>COULD BRITISH TROOPS MUTINY ? </strong><br>
  <br>
  The first question one should ask is why did the troops in World War I take 
  so much? Why, year after year, did they allow themselves to be used as cannon 
  fodder? In trying to understand the phenomenon of mass disobedience the central 
  question is not why they mutinied but why they endured for so long the conditions 
  which make mutiny the most natural of responses. In 1917 the Russian soldiers 
  declared 'enough'. Shortly after, a series of mutinies in the French armies 
  were only put down after hundreds of executions. <br>
  <br>
  There are many today who regard the power of the armed forces as beyond challenge. 
  They see military might as the ultimate weapon in the hands of the state. This 
  view, however, does not take into account the fact that armies are made up of 
  men, that men have ideas and needs of their own; that they have an urge to take 
  decisions themselves, however suppressed that desire may be, and that under 
  appropriate social and psychological conditions the armed forces can themselves 
  become a source of revolutionary activity giving expression to libertarian demands. 
  If one is looking for the establishment of permanent structures most mutinies 
  will be seen as failures. But behind the apparent failures is a more complex 
  reality. Such struggles reveal that the mighty are not invincible, and that 
  their weapon of last resort may break in their hands. <br>
  <br>
  Mutiny can be defined as the revolt of men under discipline of death. The decision 
  to mutiny is not taken lightly. For this reason it is not usually the demands 
  made by the mutineers that make the mutiny significant (the demands are often 
  granted) but the decision to mutiny. A mutiny is, in certain respects, a manifestation 
  of class conflict, if by 'class conflict' we mean the rejection of the hitherto 
  accepted relationship between order-givers and order-takers. Those involved 
  in a mutiny may participate for a number of reasons. A man may become sickened 
  by official barbarity, or by excessive punishment for trivialities. Others may 
  rebel over bad food, low pay or overwork. Homesickness or questions of conscience 
  may play important roles. The common factor behind a mutiny is not so much the 
  resentment as the decision to defy orders. Mutinies are made by those who decide 
  to mutiny, knowing that they themselves will bear the brunt of what happens. 
  <br>
  <br>
  What makes a mutiny tick? Under what circumstances do men act in solidarity, 
  in defiance of the powers-that-be? Those who mutiny come together for diverse 
  reasons and hold very different ideas about the point and purpose of the mutiny. 
  <br>
  <br>
  In the British armed forces, during the first two decades of this century, all 
  the material and psychological factors for mutiny were present and many incidents 
  took place. One of the reasons they did not grow to full stature is the skill 
  of 'our' ruling classes. Those in authority have known how and when to grant 
  concessions, and had the resources to do so. The British ruling classes before 
  World War I had over a hundred years of experience at being the supreme masters 
  in industry. Throughout the nineteenth century they had been ruthless, clever 
  and rich enough to repress, manipulate or buy off classes or groups that posed 
  any real threat to the status quo. Bestowing respectability on a limited number 
  of working class leaders and granting concessions that did not lead to any fundamental 
  transfer of power. <br>
  <br>
  One could argue that the British soldier's cultural background acted as a check 
  that prevented him from taking revolutionary action. But during World War I 
  the rationale behind military training was to drive out any qualms and restraints 
  and replace them with simple 'blood lust'. This is how Brigadier General Crozier 
  described his battalion's training programme in 1915: <br>
  <br>
  'I, for my part, do what I can to alter completely the outlook, bearing and 
  mentality of over 1000 men... Blood lust is taught for the purpose of war, in 
  bayonet fighting itself and by doping their minds with all propagandic poison. 
  The German atrocities (many of which I doubt in secret), the employment of gas 
  in action, the violation of French women, the "official murder" of Nurse Cavell, 
  all help to bring out the brute-like bestiality which is necessary for victory. 
  The process of "seeing red" which has to be carefully cultured if the effect 
  is to be lasting, is elaborately grafted into the make-up of even the meek and 
  mild .. . The Christian churches are the finest "blood lust" creators which 
  we have, and of them we must make full use.' (3) The British soldier, Crozier 
  concludes, 'is a kindly fellow ... it is necessary to corrode his mentality.' 
  (4) <br>
  <br>
  Following this kind of indoctrination men were ordered into attacks and were 
  killed in their thousands. Bewildered survivors returned, only to find the guns 
  of their officers trained on them, forcing them back to certain death. The ordinary 
  soldier was literally caught between two fires. He faced two enemies - and it 
  was not always clear which was the worse. Gradually the split between officers 
  and men was to widen. As the officers who went with the men were killed off, 
  those officers employed to 'hunt back' the men became increasingly alienated 
  from those they commanded. (5) <br>
  <br>
  Towards the end of the war the situation worsened. The widening gap between 
  officers and other ranks is reflected in the official figures relating to those 
  condemned for acts of indiscipline, refusal to obey orders or mutiny: <br>
  <br>
  'Shot for desertion : 266 soldiers, 2 officers <br>
  <br>
  Shot for cowardice : 18 soldiers <br>
  <br>
  Shot for disobedience : 5 soldiers <br>
  <br>
  Shot for sleeping on post: 2 soldiers <br>
  <br>
  Shot for quitting post: 7 soldiers <br>
  <br>
  Shot for striking or violence : 6 soldiers <br>
  <br>
  (Some 2,600 other death sentences were passed but the sentences were commuted 
  to various terms of penal servitude). ' (6) <br>
  <br>
  Tom Wintringham's figures also show a marked increase (from 1916 onwards) in 
  the number of sentences handed out. In 1916 these amounted to 60, in 1917 to 
  221, in 1918 to 676. (7) These figures, of course, do not tell us much about 
  those 'dealt with on the spot' but they reveal a substantial increase of acts 
  of indiscipline. (8) <br>
  <br>
  The authorities relied heavily on the fear of the firing squad. According to 
  Philip Knightley in the Sunday Times Supplement (April 30, 1972), 'About once 
  a week during the war, in France, Belgium, East Africa, Gallipoli, Salonica, 
  Egypt, Palestine or Serbia ... a notice was read out on parade that an unnamed 
  British soldier had been shot for cowardice or desertion'. With such morale-boosters 
  the decision to mutiny was not taken lightly. <br>
  <br>
  Few of those executed were mutineers in the proper sense of the word; many were 
  victims of what later became known as 'shell-shock'. Real mutinies began to 
  break out in the allied armies in 1917. A heavily guarded secret at the time, 
  it is now widely known that the French Army was partly neutralised by mutinies 
  in the summer of 1917. This led to a drastic revision of military strategy - 
  with British troops having to bear the brunt of the offensive. Many of the facts 
  were even concealed from the War Cabinet in England. In his biography of General 
  Trenchard, Andrew Boyle gives us an inkling of the workings of the official 
  mind: <br>
  <br>
  'It was doubtful whether a dozen senior officers, including Robertson, were 
  fully aware of the Commander in Chief's motive for concealing from Lloyd George 
  and the War Cabinet the real reason for maintaining the offensive to the bitter 
  end that autumn (1917). It is certain that few realised more vividly than Trenchard 
  why Petain had insisted on absolute security. Only the British Army could buy 
  time to stop the rot in the French forces.' (9) But the problem was wider. It 
  was also about how to stop 'the rot' spreading to British troops. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>ETAPLES: 1917</strong> <br>
  <br>
  Etaples, about 15 miles south of Boulogne, was a notorious base camp for those 
  on their way to the front. Under atrocious conditions both raw recruits from 
  England and battle-weary veterans were subjected to intensive training in gas 
  warfare, bayonet drill, and long sessions of marching at the double across the 
  dunes. After two weeks at Etaples many of the wounded were only too glad to 
  return to the front with unhealed wounds. Conditions in the hospital were punitive 
  rather than therapeutic and there had been incidents at the hospital between 
  military police and patients. <br>
  <br>
  Matters came to a head one Sunday afternoon (September 9, 1917) after the arrest 
  of a gunner in the New Zealand Artillery. A large crowd of angry men gathered 
  and did not disperse even when told the gunner had been released. It was clear 
  that the protest over the arrest was only the tip of an iceberg and the atmosphere 
  was tense. The arrival of military police only made matters worse and scuffles 
  broke out. Suddenly the sound of shooting was heard. Private H. Reeve, a military 
  policeman, had fired into the crowd killing a corporal and wounding a French 
  woman bystander. (11) News of the shooting spread quickly. By 7.30 pm over a 
  thousand angry men were pursuing the military police who fled in the direction 
  of the town. The Camp Adjutant describes how the men 'swarmed into the town, 
  raided the office of the Base Commandant, pulled him out of his chair and carried 
  him on their shoulders through the town. ' (12) <br>
  <br>
  The following morning measures were taken to prevent further outbreaks and police 
  pickets were stationed on the bridges leading into the town. Nevertheless, by 
  4 pm men had broken through the pickets and were holding meetings in the town, 
  followed by sporadic demonstrations around the camp. On Tuesday, fearing further 
  outbreaks, the Base Commandant requested reinforcements. Meanwhile, the demonstrations 
  gathered momentum. On Wednesday, September 12, in spite of orders confining 
  them to camp, over a thousand men broke out, marched through the town and then 
  on to Paris Plage. Later that day reinforcements of 400 officers and men of 
  the Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) arrived, armed with wooden staves. A 
  more sinister presence was cavalry support from the 15th Hussars and a section 
  of the Machine Gun Squadron. The threat worked: only 300 men broke camp and 
  were arrested at Etaples. The incident was now over and the reinforcements were 
  dispersed. (13) <br>
  <br>
  If shooting had broken out who knows what the effect would have been on the 
  rest of the British army in France, particularly at a time when the French army 
  was itself in such trouble? Moreover, at Etaples, the authorities could not 
  rely on New Zealand troops to shoot down Scottish demonstrators with whom they 
  had close loyalties. And a cavalry attack on unarmed men might have provoked 
  a strong reaction. In the event the authorities were able to manage with the 
  HAC. (14) <br>
  <br>
  Not all mutinies that year ended as peacefully. On September 5, only a few days 
  before the outbreak at Etaples, two companies went on strike at Boulogne. The 
  following day they tried to break out of camp and although unarmed they were 
  shot down. Twenty three were killed and twenty four wounded. (15) Yet despite 
  such harsh reprisals within four days Number 74 Labour Company also struck. 
  The authorities responded on September 11 by killing four men, wounding fifteen, 
  and inflicting prison sentences on twenty five more. (16) Only a month later 
  a similar dispute took place in the First Army Area, where five men were killed 
  and fourteen wounded. Many other strikes in the Labour Corps were similarly 
  'overcome', but casualty lists are not recorded. We know that in December 1917 
  a Guards detachment opened fire on strikers of No. 21 Labour Company at Fontinettes, 
  near Calais, killing four and wounding nine. 'Despite such rebuffs', say Gill 
  and Dallas, 'strikes amongst labour companies continued to occur'. (17) <br>
  <br>
  The severity of the repression can be explained by the fact that these particular 
  mutineers were Chinese or Egyptians whose treatment was determined by the colour 
  of their skins. Not every mutiny was put down by a display of superior strength. 
  This was due to one of the fundamental paradoxes of a rigidly disciplined organisation, 
  in wartime, of which the authorities were well aware. Once men reach the point 
  where death is familiar, fear of death has less effect. There were other restrictions 
  on the decision to shoot: draconian methods could themselves provoke further 
  trouble. <br>
  <br>
  So whilst 'native' labour troops continued to be subdued by shooting, reforms 
  were instituted to try to prevent further outbreaks at Etaples. The system of 
  training was virtually abandoned. Thousands came to believe that the Etaples 
  mutiny 'changed the whole phase of routine and "bull" from Base to Front Line'. 
  (18) <br>
  <br>
  There was a rumour that 'ringleaders of the Etaples mutiny were later shot'. 
  (19) But we have no concrete evidence to corroborate this. Official policy was 
  flexible. 'Men responsible for organising disaffection on a far larger scale 
  the following winter' say Gill and Dallas, 'in both France and the Middle East, 
  escaped without punishment at all, so threatening were the number and temper 
  of the troops who backed them up. Equally, unfortunates who ran away from the 
  trenches, if only for a day, were very often shot.' (20) <br>
  <br>
  Whatever steps the authorities took they did not stop the rising tide of mutinies 
  which continued throughout 1918, reaching a peak in the winter of 1918-1919. 
  Sometimes the anger of the mutineers broke into full-scale riots, as on the 
  night of December 9-10, 1918 'when men of the Royal Artillery stationed at Le 
  Havre Base burnt down several depots in a riot which, in its destructiveness, 
  outweighed anything which Etaples base had seen.' (21) <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>ARRAS AND VAL DE LIEVRE</strong> <br>
  <br>
  Armed with the experience of the French mutinies the authorities took careful 
  steps to avoid the spread of strife within the British Army. This partly explains 
  why severe punishments were always dished out to isolated individuals whilst 
  mass autonomous movements were often left unpunished, lest they lead to further 
  trouble. (22) <br>
  <br>
  Yet in spite of the efforts of the authorities organised disobedience continued. 
  In Arras, Canadian troops held out for two days against the officers and the 
  Military Police. It was only the supply of drink from the wine cellars that 
  prevented a further escalation of the mutiny. (23) <br>
  <br>
  At Val de Lievre there is evidence that the distribution of socialist literature 
  may have influenced the nature of the protest. This mutiny of artisans and trade 
  unionists enrolled in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps took place in the Val de 
  Lievre workshops, near Calais. At many of these camps dissatisfaction over food, 
  hours and pay were motivating factors. Grievances were communicated through 
  the Messing Committees but no action was taken. Some twelve month before the 
  Armistice matters came to a head at Val de Lievre in the form of a stay-in strike. 
  An anonymous spokesman for the mutineers said: <br>
  <br>
  'We were demanding that the working day should finish at 5 pm instead of 6 pm 
  and we failed to secure this by negotiation. A committee of the works decided 
  that all men should leave at 5 pm, ignoring the official hours. This failed 
  as the response was only partial. A staff sergeant who had been most active 
  in promoting this was moved and, we have reason to believe, victimised. However, 
  the hours were shortened by half an hour. Nevertheless discontent continued, 
  and Government war propaganda lecturers have good reason to remember the tows 
  ing they received at Val de Lievre Camp - one of the effects of reading socialist 
  publications which were smuggled into camp. ' (24) <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>PIRBRIGHT, SHOREHAM, FOLKESTONE AND DOVER</strong><br>
  <br>
  The Val de Lievre strike was followed by a similar mutiny in Britain. In early 
  1918 there was a mass walkout by Guards Machine Gunners stationed at Pirbright, 
  between Woking and Aldershot. The origins of this mutiny are obscure, yet for 
  three days every private soldier refused duty. Instead they organised voluntary 
  route marches along the lanes near the camp, in defiance of their officers, 
  returning only for meals. The strike was eventually called off when a colonel 
  of the Welsh Guards arrived and, giving an assurance that there would be no 
  victimisation, asked for a spokesman from each of the five regiments involved. 
  According to an eye-witness: <br>
  <br>
  'Five old soldiers agreed to come to the front, though to my knowledge they 
  were by no means ringleaders. They were taken off to London under close arrest, 
  court-martialed and sentenced to two years each in a military prison. The breach 
  of faith may have come about because the colonel was overruled by the GOC London 
  District. But I think we were naive to expect the public school code of honour 
  to be extended to mere rankers. The rest of the rebels - they must have numbered 
  a couple of hundred or so - were split up into their original regiments, and 
  a detachment sent to its reserve battalion for a short time before being put 
  on a draft for France again . . . Many of those men were killed in action during 
  the Great German Breakthrough of March 1913, and in subsequent fighting'. (John 
  Wood, recalling 'The Guardsman's Revolt', The Guardian. March 30, 1968.) <br>
  <br>
  Only two days after the Armistice, on November 13 1918. Shoreham was the scene 
  of a mutiny. The men marched out of the camp after a major had pushed a man 
  up to his thighs in mud. One of the mutineers (GP, from North Shields) reports: 
  <br>
  <br>
  'The next day the General came down...and formed us into three sides of a square, 
  drove his motor car into the centre, read the Army Act out, and then invited 
  any man to step out and go to work who liked; I myself was made to fall out 
  on the right by myself. You can imagine my feelings, as being an old soldier 
  of over twenty years service. Of course, I knew the consequences of my act. 
  But I never saw such loyal men in my life. Not one man moved. I could hear the 
  sergeants in the rear of the men telling them to stand by me, and it was well 
  that thev did, or I should have got ten years or so. The following morning one 
  thousand of us were demobbed, my name at the head of the list, and one thousand 
  every week afterwards. ' (25) The policy of partial concessions is a recurring 
  theme in British mutinies between 1918 and 1919. Wherever possible ringleaders 
  would be arrested. If this proved inexpedient they would be demobbed. If the 
  level of militancy led to a decision to demobilise the most militant would be 
  the first to go, with the aim of strengthening the power of the authorities 
  over those remaining. At the same time all publicity was suppressed, and each 
  outbreak isolated. <br>
  <br>
  The election campaign following the Armistice of November 1918 encouraged the 
  growth of disobedience in the armed forces. In a desperate bid to win votes 
  Lloyd George had made promises of immediate demobilisation. It matters little 
  whether he intended to keep these as the military authorities had already decided 
  to the contrary. But the promise itself had the effect of weakening military 
  discipline. The war was over and, in the absence of external threats, the pressure 
  to submit to authority was less. This was not fully appreciated by those in 
  command. There was a feeling of militancy - even of revolution - in the air. 
  People believed it was possible to build a more just society than the one which 
  had just sent so many millions to their deaths. This attitude was not confined 
  to Britain. From 1918 on, the fears of European war were replaced by fears of 
  internal revolution, throughout Europe. In Britain these fears were not laid 
  until the combined efforts of the Government and the TUC had defeated the General 
  Strike in 1926. There is no more promising material for revolution than soldiers 
  returning from wars, careless to danger and accustomed to risks and to taking 
  collective action. Peace held no prospect for them. The 'homes fit for heroes' 
  were not fit for pigs. That winter of 1918-1919 was the nearest Britain ever 
  came to social revolution: the authorities lacked the support of the armed forces 
  and the careerists in the TUC were faced with a similar situation in industry. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Dissatisfaction within the army in the winter of 1918-1919 had a number of sources, 
  one of which was the 'pivotal' scheme. Only 'key men' - those with jobs to go 
  to - could be demobilised. This meant that those who had recently joined up 
  could be released before those with longer service. The scheme was worsened 
  by bureaucratic bungling: men were sent home for Christmas and told that those 
  who had found jobs need not return. But forms had to be filled in by their employers. 
  The employers' contract had then to be endorsed by the Ministry of Labour. After 
  this the man's unit would be asked if he could be spared. Meanwhile, while 'procedure' 
  took its course, the men had to return via Folkestone to Calais. Some were demobbed 
  on arrival, only to discover that there was no transport back to England. To 
  make matters worse, there were no facilities for food and refreshment on the 
  return journey. <br>
  <br>
  Then there was the very real threat of being sent to fight against the Bolsheviks 
  in Russia. Although the Government were insisting that only volunteers were 
  being sent to Russia there was widespread knowledge that many unwilling conscripts 
  had been packed off. <br>
  <br>
  During the few weeks following the Shoreham incident there was a flood of mutinies. 
  Those at Folkestone and Dover were major disturbances. The mutinies broke out 
  too soon after the Armistice for delay in demobilisation to be considered the 
  sole cause. Antagonism towards officers, hatred of arbitrary discipline, and 
  a revolt against bad conditions and uncertainty about the prospect of being 
  sent to Russia all combined with the delay, confusion and uncertainty about 
  demobilisation, to provide suitable ingredients. In Folkestone, on January 3 
  1919, the news that men were to be sent back to France kindled the spark of 
  mutiny. The Daily Herald reported in somewhat euphoric terms: <br>
  <br>
  'On their own signal - three taps of a drum - two thousand men, unarmed and 
  in perfect order, demonstrated the fact that they were fed up - absolutely fed 
  up. Their plan of action had been agreed upon the night before: no military 
  boat should be allowed to leave Folkestone for France that day or any day until 
  they were guaranteed their freedom. It was sheer, flat, brazen, open and successful 
  mutiny. Pickets were posted at the harbour. Only Canadian and Australian soldiers 
  were to be allowed to sail - if they wanted to. As a matter of no very surprising 
  fact they did not want to. One officer tried to interfere. He leapt across the 
  gangway and got a rough-house. 'I am a relative of Sir Douglas Haig' one of 
  the officers pleaded. <br>
  <br>
  'We are all King's messengers' said another party. But nothing of that kind 
  availed them. <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile troop trains were arriving in Folkestone with more men returning from 
  leave and on their way to France. They were met with pickets... in a mass they 
  joined the demonstrators. <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday an armed guard of Fusilliers was posted at the quays by the Army 
  authorities. They carried fixed bayonets and ball cartridges. The pickets approached. 
  One rifle made a show of going up: the foremost picket seized it, and forthwith 
  the rest of the guard fell back. <br>
  <br>
  The mutineers visited the station in a body, after having posted their own harbour 
  guards, and tore down a large label marked 'For Officers Only'... <br>
  <br>
  On Saturday a great procession of soldiers, swelled now to about 10,000, marched 
  through the town. Everywhere the townspeople showed their sympathy. At midday 
  a mass meeting decided to form a soldiers union. They appointed their officials 
  and chose their spokesmen.' (26) Sir William Robertson, from the War Office, 
  came down from London and conceded the men's demands. Everyone was to be given 
  seven days leave. The men were allowed to elect one hundred and forty demobilisation 
  committees, from the rank and file. Complete indemnity was promised. The Herald 
  said: <br>
  <br>
  'Everywhere the feeling is the same, the war is over, we won't have to fight 
  in Russia, and we mean to go home.' (27) There were fears that soldiers would 
  be sent to fight in Russia but the message came over loud and clear: the vast 
  majority were not prepared to be used. It is thanks to the courage of those 
  who put their own needs before loyalty to the flag that a much larger contingent 
  of British troops was not sent to Russia. <br>
  <br>
  Another 4,000 troops demonstrated at Dover, in support of the Folkestone mutiny. 
  They held a mass meeting in the harbour station and selected a deputation to 
  meet the authorities. They then marched up to the Town Hall behind their deputies 
  and formed lines on either side of the road, overflowing into the side streets. 
  The mayor had to admit them into the Town Hall, where a piano was provided for 
  their entertainment. Nearby a cinema was opened for the soldiers to enjoy a 
  free film show. <br>
  <br>
  The implications of these mutinies were very serious. To prevent a spread of 
  unrest it was resolved that Horatio Bottomley, well known demagogue and MP and 
  editor of the magazine John Bull, be sent to intervene as the 'soldier's friend'. 
  (28) Leave was extended. A team of Ministry of Labour officials backed by an 
  army of clerks arrived to speed up the checking of labour contracts so that 
  those with jobs could be quickly released. <br>
  <br>
  Immediately after the victory at Folkestone-Dover there were other outbreaks. 
  The 'iron discipline' of the British Army was cracking under the strain. One 
  of the more spectacular events took place on Monday January 6 1919, when over 
  1500 members of the Army Service Corps at Osterley (Isleworth) seized lorries 
  and drove them into Whitehall. It was widely believed that this corps would 
  be the last to be demobilised. The men had other intentions. Within four days 
  they were all demobilised. There were further outbreaks at Shoreham where seven 
  thousand walked out, marching into Brighton. They were joined by a detachment 
  of Royal Marine Engineers from Southwick. There were no reprisals and the men's 
  grievances were dealt with immediately. That same day (January 6) there were 
  several other incidents including a walk out at the Shortlands RASC depot where 
  five hundred walked out, and marched to the central hall at Bromley. There were 
  further demonstrations in London, when four hundred men bound for South Russia 
  refused to board a train - a surprising incident if all soldiers destined for 
  Russia were really volunteers. <br>
  <br>
  Later that week mutinies broke out at Bristol, Fairlop, Grove Park, Kempton 
  Park, Park Royal, Sydenham and Aldershot. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>THE WAR CABINET </strong><br>
  <br>
  There was panic at the War Office. The War Cabinet was deeply divided. On February 
  6, 1919 Field Marshall Sir Henry Wilson, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, 
  wrote in his diary: <br>
  <br>
  'The whole of the demobilisation has been completely boxed up by Lloyd George, 
  who in his anxiety to get votes at the General Election, kept adding every sort 
  of authority to help. .. If Lloyd George doesn't announce to the country that 
  the war is not over, the whole army will be turned into rabble.' (29) The next 
  day, following talks at No 10 Downing Street, he wrote: <br>
  <br>
  'I told Lloyd George to come out into the open and back the War Office.. .to 
  crush the poisonous parts of the press. . .to say that the war is not over. 
  ..To prepare the public mind for armies of occupation in India, Gibraltar, Malta, 
  France, etc. .. This frightened Lloyd George and he agreed.' (30) On January 
  8 delegates from the Folkestone and Dover mutinies arrived in London, with delegates 
  from other camps. This was the first overt sign of the growth of rank and file 
  links,, No matter what the War Office intended the Army was going home. There 
  was nothing the Government could do but concede their demands. Field Marshall 
  Wilson was furious. He recorded his displeasure in his diary: <br>
  <br>
  'the whole trouble is due to Lloyd George and his cursed campaign for vote catching. 
  Now he is forced up against something ugly as I told him he would be. At a meeting 
  of the military members this afternoon we agreed that the AG should draw up 
  a paper showing how constant civilian interference has wrecked our carefully 
  worked scheme for demobilisation and explaining clearly that unless we soldiers 
  were allowed to run our own show, we would have a disaster.' (31) The War Cabinet 
  had adopted a scheme to retain a large percentage of the troops in some form 
  of compulsory service. Wilson and Churchill supported sending troops to Russia, 
  to 'knock out' Bolshevism. When Lloyd George left for the first Paris peace 
  talks they co-operated to devise a compulsory service scheme. The plan aimed 
  at having a million men in khaki, ready to put forces on the Rhine, to send 
  men to Russia, to provide other armies of occupation and to cope with the situation 
  in Britain. From the point of view of the fanatics in the War Office the manpower 
  demands for Britain's post-war policy (repression in Ireland, intervention in 
  Russia, occupation of the Rhineland, and curbing of industrial unrest at home) 
  were incompatible with large-scale demobilisation. Wilson and Churchill agreed 
  that once they had piloted the scheme through the War Cabinet they should go 
  together and confront Lloyd George with a fait accompli. They could then put 
  the scheme into operation without further delay. Lloyd George, more aware of 
  the realities, suspected that the scheme would not be accepted by troops already 
  in open defiance. Churchill was therefore prevented from putting his plans to 
  the War Cabinet. <br>
  <br>
  Undaunted, Wilson and Churchill held an unofficial Cabinet meeting. Says Wilson: 
  <br>
  <br>
  'An unofficial Cabinet meeting took place in the form of certain 'conversations'. 
  The case was put strongly by Churchill, that discipline was disappearing fast 
  in the Army and Haig added that if things continued there would be no army left 
  in France.' (32) Reluctant assent was given to their proposals. No secretary 
  was present and no minutes taken. Following the meeting Churchill and Wilson 
  crossed the Channel and pressured Lloyd George into an equally unwilling agreement. 
  Even members of the Government expressed reservations at this blatant breach 
  of faith. 'Bonar Law', says Wilson, 'is terrified of the scheme coming out, 
  because of his election pledges.' The next stage was comparatively easy: the 
  support of the press was needed for the re introduction of compulsory service. 
  Wilson had no doubt that they would comply and he wrote confidently in his diary: 
  <br>
  <br>
  'We will get all the press to bring out their puffs on Wednesday, and we will 
  follow up with an Army Order on Thursday. Then the great adventure of compulsing 
  (sic) a million men in the name of peace will have begun. There is not a moment 
  to lose. All power within the Army is slipping away. We shall get one million 
  men, who will be compelled to serve for months. Of course if these men refuse 
  to serve we are done, but I have no fear. Winston and I can get full support 
  from the press.'(33) Support from the press was crucial if a scheme which negated 
  election pledges made only a few weeks earlier was to be implemented. As expected, 
  the meeting with the press went off smoothly. Churchill and Wilson told them 
  of 'their responsibility to the nation.' The hacks eagerly complied. According 
  to Wilson 'the press behaved loyally and understood that the Army was in a state 
  of flux and that the men were disposed to take their opinions from what they 
  read in the newspapers.' (34) <br>
  <br>
  But events were slipping out of the hands of megalomaniacs in the War Office. 
  Unrest was sweeping the country. The common soldier was beginning to write history 
  with his feet. Whatever the War Office had in mind the troops were determined 
  to make their own decisions. A military adventure in Russia was low on their 
  list of priorities. <br>
  <br>
  By January 8 1919, some 300,000 men had been demobilised. The release of the 
  'pivotal' men alone was proceeding at the rate of 4, 000 a day. Disturbances 
  were still taking place throughout the country. On January 8, over 4,000 RASC 
  men marched from Park Royal to Whitehall, where a reluctant Sir William Robertson 
  conceded their demands for an immediate demobilisation, and promised there would 
  be no victimisation. There was a further demonstration by 600 men of the Flying 
  Service at Westerham Hill aerodrome, Kent. Several hundred men of the RAF School 
  of Imperial Gunnery at Hythe marched to the Hotel Imperial and protested. Several 
  hundred RAF men at Felixstowe marched on the Harwich defence. 100 men belonging 
  to the Highland Light Infantry marched to the headquarters of the Scottish Command 
  in Edinburgh. A large contingent of men from the Queen's, the Gloucester's and 
  Wiltshire's in Maidstone, held a protest meeting in the High Street before marching 
  on the Town Hall. (35) The first significant concession was the abolition of 
  the contract system. <br>
  <br>
  In a. desperate attempt to keep control Lloyd George made an appeal for restraint 
  on January 9 1919. This was followed up by an Army Council notice to all units 
  stating that: <br>
  <br>
  'Officers and soldiers who embarked on and after January 12 for leave in the 
  United Kingdom are only permitted to proceed on leave to the United Kingdom 
  on the distinct understanding that they are to return to their units on the 
  expiration of their leave, and that they will not be demobilised, under any 
  pretext whatsoever, while on leave.' (36) The day this notice was published 
  a large number of RAMC men in Blackpool refused to go on parade until all restrictions 
  on their Corps were lifted. By now the number of 'pivotal' men released daily 
  had reached 6,000 and a further 70,000 applications had been received. Meanwhile 
  125,000 miners had secured demobilisation and it was estimated that no less 
  than 140,000 men per week were being discharged in the United Kingdom alone. 
  The military authorities hoped to regain some control over the demobilised troops 
  since they believed that a clash between the Government and organised labour 
  was inevitable. There was therefore considerable embarrassment when the Daily 
  Herald published a circular that had been sent to discharged members of the 
  Honourable Artillery Company (HAC), which stated: <br>
  <br>
  'The CO hopes that all those who have served in the HAC and are physically fit 
  and able to rejoin in the event of any national emergency should communicate 
  their address from time to time to the OCHAC depot... Those who are fully competent 
  as either motor mechanics, mechanical railway, electrical engineers, dispatch 
  riders, telegraphonists, signallers, etc. , are particularly requested to notify 
  on the back thereof these or any other special qualifications which they may 
  possess.' (37) The Government were pinning hopes on their ability to defeat 
  the unions in the event of a confrontation. There was plenty of evidence before 
  the trade union 'leaders' that in the event of a showdown the Army would not 
  stand by the Government. However, the labour bureaucrats did everything they 
  could to avoid a confrontation. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>SOUTHAMPTON: 1919</strong> <br>
  <br>
  A reminder of the strength of ordinary soldiers came from Southampton, in the 
  middle of January, when 20,000 soldiers went on strike and took over the docks. 
  Robertson, Commander in Chief of the Home Forces, sent General Trenchard to 
  restore military authority. Trenchard had witnessed several mutinies in the 
  French Army and was quite prepared to employ the most ruthless measures. Nevertheless 
  he underestimated the men as he approached the dockgate and attempted to address 
  a reluctant audience. A chorus of boos and catcalls accompanied his remarks. 
  The meeting came to an undignified end when a group of men took hold of him 
  and gave him a going over before ejecting him. Said Trenchard: <br>
  <br>
  'It was most unpleasant.. . It was the only time in my life I'd been really 
  hustled. They said they did not want to listen to me. They told me to get out 
  and stay out.' (38) Smarting from his minor injuries and major wounds to his 
  pride, Trenchard acted with the vengeful cunning which had preserved his military 
  caste for generations. Indifferent to the grievances of the soldiers - many 
  of whom had seen active service - he saw only a mutinous rabble to be put down 
  by force. Fully aware that the mutineers were not armed he phoned a request 
  to the garrison commander at Portsmouth for 250 armed men plus an escort of 
  Military Police. In spite of fierce objections from Southern Command, Trenchard 
  made it perfectly clear that if necessary he would initiate a blood-bath. <br>
  <br>
  The following morning Trenchard returned to the quayside and waited for the 
  troop train from Portsmouth. Only when the unarmed mutineers had been surrounded 
  by armed troops with their safety bolts in firing position did Trenchard make 
  a second attempt to address the troops. And even then he was told to 'drop dead' 
  by a sergeant, who was promptly arrested. Following this incident the mutiny 
  collapsed. 170 soldiers were personally selected as ringleaders by Trenchard, 
  fifty three of whom were confined in a nearby troopship. <br>
  <br>
  The docks were now quiet but a few score soldiers had barricaded themselves 
  in their billets. Hose pipes were commandeered and after half an hour Trenchard's 
  riot squad had captured about 100 soaked and shivering men who were then forced 
  to stand in the January frost outside Trenchard's office until the latter had 
  satisfied his desire for vengeance. <br>
  <br>
  A few weeks later, in early February, Trenchard was called in by Churchill, 
  then Minister for War and Air, and was congratulated on his 'masterly handling 
  of the Southampton riots' and appointed Chief of the Air Staff. (Duel of Eagles 
  by Peter Townsend, Weidenfeld &: Nicolson, 1970, pp 47-8) <br>
  <br>
  Unrest amongst the troops merged with unrest in industry. By February 1919 large 
  numbers of soldiers were refusing to return to the Continent. Civil disturbances 
  in mining areas, which under normal circumstances would have been quelled by 
  a show of force, presented grave problems to the authorities, since it was not 
  clear whether the troops could be relied upon. Eventually the Army Council decided 
  that there was a Guards division that could be trusted and issued instructions 
  for them to be brought back from the Continent. The Guards were used on a number 
  of occasions, for example to disarm the Durham Light Infantry at Colchester, 
  when they refused to embark for Russia. <br>
  <br>
  How near was Britain to a full scale revolution during these weeks? This must 
  remain a matter for speculation. The Army was in disarray: soldiers and sailors 
  councils and demobilisation clubs were being formed. Delegates from various 
  camps were beginning to combine their efforts and resources. The number of strikes 
  in Liverpool and Glasgow were increasing. There were riots in Glasgow and troops 
  sent to occupy the streets were beginning to fraternise with the strikers and 
  demonstrators. There were riots in Belfast and a national railway strike was 
  imminent. From August 1918 until mid-1919 even the police force was affected 
  by militant strike action. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>RAF BIGGIN HILL: JANUARY 1919</strong> <br>
  <br>
  This dispute was in many ways typical of the smaller struggles of this period. 
  The 500 RAF men of the Wireless Experimental Establishment at the South Camp 
  of the famous 'Battle of Britain' airfield at Biggin Hill had been living in 
  absolutely appalling conditions. Most of them slept in tents, the camp was a 
  sea of mud and all the duck-boards and other stealable fuel had been burnt to 
  obtain warmth in the freezing weather. The dining hall was a canvas hangar with 
  its roof in shreds. The men had to eat in a morass of three inches of mud. Food 
  was prepared in a cookhouse which was an open, rusty shed. Matters were made 
  worse by the officious attitude of the authorities. <br>
  <br>
  One evening in January, after a particularly foul meal, the men held a meeting. 
  They had already complained many times to the authorities, without result. The 
  meeting decided overwhelmingly in favour of strike action. The 'Red Flag' was 
  sung and there were calls for a more active and radical policy, including a 
  call for a march down Piccadilly smashing all the windows en route. These proposals 
  were defeated. <br>
  <br>
  The next morning no one turned out for duty. When the orderly officer tried 
  to discover what was happening he was turned away from the dining hall by a 
  sergeant and two men who refused to recognise his authority. The men removed 
  magnetos from all vehicles in the camp, including those belonging to civilian 
  contractors. Support came from the men of 141 Squadron of the RAF stationed 
  in the neighbouring North Camp, who refused to intervene on the side of the 
  authorities. The strike committee was in complete control. <br>
  <br>
  A deputation was sent to the CO, Colonel Blanchy (the new RAF ranks had not 
  been fully introduced) and presented the following demands: <br>
  <br>
  1. No man to be victimised. <br>
  <br>
  2. Unless we receive a satisfactory answer from the Commandant we will put our 
  case before Lord Weir, i.e. our deputation will proceed to his quarters. <br>
  <br>
  (a) The men state that when they go "sick" the Medical Officer says that their 
  complaints are due to the disgraceful conditions of the camp food and sanitary 
  arrangements. <br>
  <br>
  (b) Names of the men who can bear witness to the above statement can be supplied 
  if necessary. <br>
  <br>
  (c) We demand that Major --- shall be dismissed from this unit. <br>
  <br>
  (d) Leave to be carried on in the normal way. <br>
  <br>
  (e) The men demand that they leave the camp until it is put into a habitable 
  condition by the civilian employees. <br>
  <br>
  (f) Temporary release of those men who have jobs waiting and those who want 
  to get jobs pending discharge. While the men are at home demobilisations must 
  continue, and the men be advised by letter or telegram. <br>
  <br>
  (g) Abolition of work on Saturday afternoons and Sundays. <br>
  <br>
  (h) Restrictions placed on Y.M.C.A. to be removed, prices in canteen to be lowered 
  and a full explanation given as to what happens to P.R.I, funds. <br>
  <br>
  (i) Efficient transport to be provided for officers, NCOs and men. <br>
  <br>
  3. Grievances. <br>
  <br>
  Sanitary: <br>
  <br>
  (a) Wash-house - only 5 basins for 500 men. <br>
  <br>
  (b) Wet feet - no gum boots issued. <br>
  <br>
  (c) Dirty and leaking huts. <br>
  <br>
  (d) NO BATHS. <br>
  <br>
  (e) Inefficient latrines. <br>
  <br>
  Food: <br>
  <br>
  (a) Shortage. <br>
  <br>
  (b) Badly cooked. <br>
  <br>
  (c) Dirty cook-house staff. <br>
  <br>
  (d) Dining Hall in a disgraceful condition. <br>
  <br>
  (e) Fully trained cooks should be substituted for present inefficient youths. 
  <br>
  <br>
  THESE DEMANDS TO BE CONCEDED BY NOON TODAY.<br>
  <br>
  Blanchy offered to accompany the delegation to the Area HQ at Covent Garden 
  to support their case! The men agreed, and the magnetos were replaced in a sufficient 
  number of vehicles to transport the delegation. Meanwhile the rest of the camp 
  remained on strike. The Area second in command was shown around the camp by 
  the strike committee, and the outcome was that the whole camp was immediately 
  sent on leave for ten days, during which time conditions were drastically improved 
  and the other demands largely conceded. When the strike ended there were no 
  victimisations. This solid, but limited, struggle had met with complete success.

  <br>
  <strong><br>
  CALAIS: 1919 </strong><br>
  <br>
  Unrest within the Army in France continued. A court martial at Etaples on September 
  22, 1918 sentenced five youths aged seventeen to nineteen to ten years imprisonment 
  for acts of indiscipline. (40) This led to further agitation for their release. 
  There was a growing campaign against the censorship of news from home and soldiers 
  at Calais elected delegates who also acted as distributors for the then prohibited 
  Daily Herald. There were also demands for instant dismantling of the Val de 
  Lievre workshops. <br>
  <br>
  The stability of the Army on the Continent was affected by events back home. 
  In France, in the war zone, official brutalities were rife. One example was 
  at the prison at Les Attaques. where men were detained for trivial offences 
  such as overstaying their leave by a few hours. Prisoners were only supplied 
  with one blanket, during one of the severest winter for decades. They were flogged 
  and manacled for merely talking to each other. <br>
  <br>
  At the end of January 1919, the men of the Army Ordnance and Mechanical Transport 
  sections at the Val de Lievre camp called a mass meeting which decided to mutiny. 
  Conditions in the camp were bad, and reports of several incidents had already 
  found their way into the newspapers. <br>
  <br>
  The Calais mutiny began after agitation for demobilisation. It coincided with 
  the arrest of Private John Pantling, of the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, while 
  delivering what the authorities described as a 'seditious speech to an assembly 
  of soldiers.' <br>
  <br>
  On pay night the men at Val de Lievre smashed open the jail and let Pantling 
  out. The authorities tried to recapture him. When this failed, fresh military 
  police were brought in. They arrested the sergeant of the guard for failing 
  to prevent the prisoner's 'escape'. Anger was now rising. The Commanding Officer 
  - by now a very frightened man - released the sergeant, and called off the attempt 
  to recapture Pantling. He also agreed to a meeting with the men to discuss their 
  grievances. The next day many concessions were made, including shorter hours. 
  <br>
  <br>
  While this was taking place there was a distinct hardening of the attitude of 
  the officers. The soldiers spent the weekend organising the other camps into 
  Soldiers Councils. On Sunday the officers struck back and rearrested Pantling. 
  The news spread quickly. On Monday the newly organised Soldiers Councils called 
  a strike. Not a single man turned up for reveille. The sentries were replaced 
  by pickets. That same morning, at another camp in nearby Vendreux, over 2,000 
  men came out in sympathy. Later that morning they marched to the Calais camp 
  as a gesture of solidarity. After a mass meeting both camps marched behind brass 
  bands towards the headquarters, where Brigadier Rawlinson was stationed. By 
  now the mutineers totalled 4,000. The headquarters were quickly surrounded and 
  a deputation entered. They demanded the release of Private Pantling. The authorities 
  capitulated and promised that he would be back in his camp within twenty-four 
  hours. <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday morning he was returned. But by now some 20, 000 men had joined the 
  mutiny and the strike was spreading French workers were cooperating and a total 
  embargo was placed upon the movement of British military traffic by rail. In 
  fact the rail stoppage was a significant factor in the escalation of the struggle. 
  5,000 infantrymen due to return home, finding themselves delayed, struck in 
  support of their own demand for immediate demobilisation. (41) <br>
  <br>
  In an attempt to intimidate the mutineers General Byng and fresh troops were 
  sent for. Unfortunately Byng made the mistake of arriving before his men. His 
  car was immediately commandeered by the mutineers and replaced by a modest Ford. 
  Byng's troops were delayed for a further two days by Lhe blacking of British 
  transport. When they arrived machine guns were placed at strategic points, such 
  as food stores and munition dumps. Byng's troops, in the words of a participant, 
  were 'bits of boys who were sent out just as the war ended. ' (42) <br>
  <br>
  Fresh from the growing unrest at home. they were even more reluctant to be in 
  khaki than the Calais mutineers themselves. They started fraternising with them 
  and before longhad joined the mutineers. The strike continued. <br>
  <br>
  Some barrack room lawyer pointed out that Pantling could be rearrested at any 
  time. It was decided that it would be to his advantage to be court-martialled 
  whilst the soldiers were still in control. His acquittal would then be binding 
  and he would be safe from further arrest. Reluctantly, the officers had to agree. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The strike was now total. It was led and coordinated by the strike committee, 
  which now took the title of 'The Calais Soldiers' and Sailors' Association.' 
  Their method of organising was strictly democratic. Each hut or group of huts 
  elected a delegate to the Camp Committee. These committees then sent delegates 
  to the Central Area Committee. By-passing the officers, these committees issued 
  daily orders from the occupied Headquarters. <br>
  <br>
  The quality and quantity of the food increased. The food surplus served to confirm 
  the rumour that officers had secretly been selling food to French businessmen. 
  S.C.A. Cannel, who was working as a clerk at the Ordnance Depot testified how: 
  <br>
  <br>
  'our food was being "flogged" to French people. In fact, I saw with my own eyes, 
  clothes baskets full of bully, cheese and bacon going out of the camps at night. 
  ' (43) Eventually a conference was arranged, at which major concessions were 
  won. But the mutiny was drawing to a close. On the evening of the conference, 
  whilst most of the soldiers were attending a local cinema, a surprise vote was 
  taken. The result was acceptance of an officer's ultimatum to return under orders. 
  These men then had to face the wrath of their comrades, who returned to discover 
  that the mutiny had virtually collapsed. <br>
  <br>
  During the mutiny contacts had been made with French workers, and with allied 
  forces on the Rhine. Troops at Dunkirk were also ready to come out, and there 
  was little doubt that they would have found support amongst workers and troops 
  back home. Had the movement continued it could clearly have developed a revolutionary 
  character. A further significant sign that the army was crumbling was when women 
  of the Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary stayed away from work, in solidarity with 
  the Calais strike. (44) <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, in Scotland, the Clyde strike had also collapsed. This played a part 
  in lowering the morale of the Calais mutineers, who drew back from a course 
  of action leading to revolution. <br>
  <br>
  This incident had shaken the authorities to the core. British troops had shown 
  they were capable of highly sophisticated forms of struggle, forging important 
  links with other sectors of the army and with the civilian population. Although 
  the strike was over, the authorities never felt strong enough to victimise the 
  strike committees or to reimpose the old type of military discipline. Soldiers 
  were free to return to camp whenever they felt like it, and to enter cafes and 
  the like during 'prohibited' hours, without fear of disciplinary action. The 
  food was improved. New huts were erected. Weekend work was abolished. The Calais 
  Area Soldiers' and Sailors' Association continued to meet and applied for representation 
  on the newly formed Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmen's Union. <br>
  <br>
  The mutiny had ended on January 30 1919. Within three months demobilisation 
  began in earnest - only just in time to avert another wave of mutiny. The lesson 
  that the military machine could be beaten had been learnt. (45) Churchill commented 
  at the time that 'if these armies had formed a "united resolve", if they had 
  been seduced from the standards of duty and patriotism, there was no power which 
  could have attempted to withstand them. ' (46) <br>
  <br>
  <strong><br>
  WHITEHALL (FEBRUARY 1919) AND THE WAR OFFICE CIRCULAR </strong><br>
  <br>
  This fear of uniting the troops prevented the War Office from giving full rein 
  to Neanderthal-types like Trenchard. An incident occurred however which could 
  have led to severe loss of life with untold consequences. It happened when three 
  thousand demonstrating troops marched on Whitehall in February 1919. On February 
  8 troops returning to France after a period of leave refused to board for Calais. 
  Orders were given for the railway station to be surrounded by a detachment of 
  Guards. Sir Henry Wilson expressed the fear that there were no troops that could 
  be relied upon to deal with the trouble. <br>
  <br>
  A few hours later the three thousand mutineers marched into Whitehall. From 
  his window Churchill could see the men, who by now had occupied Horse Guards 
  Parade. He was informed by General Fielding that a reserve battalion of Grenadiers 
  and two troops of the Household Cavalry were available. Churchill then asked 
  whether they could be relied upon to obey orders. After an affirmative answer 
  he ordered the General to have his men surround the demonstrators and take them 
  prisoner. The Guards encircled the demonstrators, machine guns trained on them. 
  They then advanced, bayonets at the ready. If the mutineers had not surrendered 
  there could have been a bloodbath. This was one time when Churchill was not 
  eager to be seen with his troops. Later the mighty warrior confessed: 'I remained 
  in my room, a prey to anxiety.'(47) <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile the rot in the army in England continued, unchecked. At Battersea, 
  troops of the Army Service Corps went on strike. They were joined by Service 
  Corps men in Camberwell and Kempton Park, the latter demanding civilian rates 
  of pay for mending lorries intended for sale. <br>
  <br>
  One question dominated the Government: 'Could the troops be relied on, in the 
  event of revolution or serious civil disturbance in England?' The Guards Division, 
  as we have mentioned, was hastily recalled from Germany. But uncertainty about 
  the reliability of the Army persisted, as reports flooded in. <br>
  <br>
  Towards the end of January 1919 a most revealing episode took place. Concerned 
  at the spread of the spirit of disobedience among civilians and about the constant 
  talk of 'trade unionism' in the army, and alarmed at the prospect of a miners' 
  strike which might have rallied the support of the Triple Alliance (of railwaymen, 
  miners and transport workers) the War Office issued a circular, officially described 
  as 'secret' to the Commanding Officers of all Army units. Several weeks later 
  the document was 'leaked' to the Daily Herald ... who published it. A heated 
  discussion of some of the issues involved took place in the Committee debate 
  on the Army Estimates, on May 29, 1919. <br>
  <br>
  The Circular requested of the Army officers that they provide weekly reports 
  'to reach this office without fail not later than first post each Thursday morning' 
  on a number of important matters, including the following: <br>
  <br>
  'Will troops in various areas respond to orders for assistance to preserve the 
  public peace?' <br>
  <br>
  'Will they assist in strike-breaking?' <br>
  <br>
  'Will they parade for draft to overseas, especially to Russia?' Station Commanders 
  were also asked to report weekly on: <br>
  <br>
  'Whether there is any growth of trade unionism among the units under your command?' 
  <br>
  <br>
  'The effect outside trade unions have on them' <br>
  <br>
  'Whether any agitation from internal or external sources is affecting them' 
  <br>
  <br>
  'Whether any Soldiers' Councils have been formed'.<br>
  <br>
  The information was needed 'with a view to the establishment of an efficient 
  Intelligence Service whereby the Army Council can keep its finger on the pulse 
  of the troops'. The facts were required 'for the information of the Secretary 
  of State for War' (then Winston Churchill). <br>
  <br>
  Nearly 60 years later the debate still makes fascinating reading. Better than 
  many a learned thesis it reveals the arrogance and duplicity of the ruling class 
  and the cringing of the trade union bureaucrats turned professional politicians. 
  <br>
  <br>
  According to Winston Churchill the queries in the Circular, analysed over a 
  4 month period, had produced the following replies : <br>
  <br>
  'Troops may be relied on to assist the civil power to preserve the public peace 
  and to protect persons and property. They resent unofficial strikes .. . and 
  realise their duty as citizens in repressing disorderly persons.' <br>
  <br>
  'They deprecate being used in "strike breaking" and the general feeling is that 
  it would not be fair to ask troops to do what they themselves would consider 
  "blackleg" work.' <br>
  <br>
  'Troops will parade for drafts overseas with the exception of Russia.'<br>
  <br>
  Then, as now, the War Office was as interested in industrial relations as the 
  Board of Trade or, later, the Ministry of Labour. Then, as now, there was no 
  doubt as to whose side they were on. What was relatively unique about the episode 
  was that as a result of a series of bureaucratic bungles the military establishment 
  was forced to discuss openly (even if only very partially) a number of important 
  matters that until then they had managed to disci only among themselves. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>THE NAVY</strong> <br>
  <br>
  Whilst the mutinies in the German and French Navies have been well documented 
  little information is available concerning the Royal Navy. (49) There was, however, 
  considerable tallc of mutiny at Portsmouth, in the summer of 1918. The threat 
  was serious enough for Lionel Yexley, an admiralty agent, (50) to write a report 
  warning the Admiralty of impending trouble. This was only averted by immediate 
  improvements in pay and conditions. Demands for 'lower deck' organisation were 
  taken seriously. Agitation for trade union representation was spreading throughout 
  the Navy. <br>
  <br>
  The material conditions of the sailors certainly justified a mutiny. Between 
  1852 and 1917 there had only been one pay increase, amounting to a penny a day, 
  in 1912. Wartime inflation had reduced the sailors' nineteen pence a day to 
  a mere pittance. Another twopence a day was granted in 1917, plus a miserable 
  separation allowance of ten shillings and six pence a week, for wives. Following 
  a series of mutinies in 1919 pay increases of over two hundred per cent were 
  granted. <br>
  <br>
  After the Russian Revolution the British Navy was sent into action against the 
  Russians. It proved ineffective, but this ineffectiveness had less to do with 
  the efforts of the Bolsheviks than with the unwillingness of the British seamen 
  to fight. The extent of these mutinies can be measured by reference to the following 
  comment made in the House of Commons by G. Lambert MP, on March 12 1919: <br>
  <br>
  '. . .undoubtedly there was, at the end of last year, grave unrest in the Navy. 
  .. I do not wish to be violent, but I think I am correct in saying that a match 
  would have touched off an explosion.' (51) Shortly after the armistice with 
  Germany the crew of a light cruiser, at Libau on the Baltic, mutinied. Many 
  other ships were sent home from Archangel and Murmansk after similar experiences. 
  In spite of a propaganda campaign against Russia it was becoming increasingly 
  difficult to obtain reliable crews. Refusals to weigh for Russia were a regular 
  occurrence at Invergordon, Portsmouth, Rosyth, Devonport and Fort Edgar. <br>
  <br>
  We have heard a great deal from labour historians about the refusal of dockers 
  to load the 'Jolly George' with an arms consignment for Poland in May 1920. 
  But we have heard virtually nothing about far greater challenges to authority 
  in the armed forces. For example, early in 1919 a group of dock workers discovered 
  that the destination of a large cruiser being refitted at Rosyth was Russia. 
  Together with some members of the Socialist Labour Party they leafleted the 
  crew, who refused to sail. In fact the crew stayed put for three weeks, although 
  isolated in mid-stream, until their demands were met and they were paid off 
  at Portsmouth. <br>
  <br>
  In January 1919 there were mutinies on the mine-sweepers at Rosyth. On January 
  13, 1919 there was a mutiny on the patrol boat 'Kilbride' at Milford Haven, 
  where the red flag was hoisted. This was an uneasy year for the Admiralty. On 
  October 12, one hundred and fifty seamen had broken out of their ships at Port 
  Edgar on hearing that they were due to return to the Baltic. The First Destroyer 
  Flotilla was prevented from returning to the Baltic war. Eventually half the 
  ships sailed on August 14, their crews made up from Atlantic Fleet battleships. 
  Although most of the mutineers were arrested, some 44 men made their way to 
  London to present petitions at Whitehall. They were arrested at King's Cross 
  and sent to Chatham Barracks. (52) Between October 12 and November 21, 1919 
  some ninety six offenders had been arrested and punished, ten by imprisonment. 
  (53) It should be remembered that the government had repeatedly pledged that 
  only volunteers would be sent to fight against the Russians. It is clear that 
  this was not the practice employed by the Admiralty. Those who did not intend 
  to 'volunteer' had little choice but to mutiny and face the consequences. <br>

  to 'volunteer' had little choice but to mutiny and face the consequences. <br>
  <br>
  By November 1919 discontent had spread to the aircraft carrier 'Vindictive' 
  in Copenhagen. A marine detachment was called in to disperse a group of seamen 
  demanding leave. Two men were arrested. Later two stokers were caught trying 
  to stop the fan engines. They were each given five years. The following morning 
  virtually no one turned up for duty. This provoked Captain Grace to arrest five 
  more alleged 'ringleaders'. They were condemned to ninety days hard labour before 
  a dishonourable discharge. Another six were arrested, but resistance continued. 
  The next morning 14 crewmen were still refusing duty and were arrested. That 
  evening another two arrests were made. (53a) <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile the crews of the minesweepers operating in the Baltic declared they 
  had had enough. There were incidents aboard the flagship 'Delhi', in December, 
  when only 25% of the crew responded to a command to return to Biorko in the 
  Gulf of Finland. <br>
  <br>
  There was a further naval mutiny in Russia, that of the gunboat 'Cicala' in 
  the White Sea. Death sentences were imposed on the 'ringleaders'. The fact that 
  these were later commuted to one year's imprisonment reflects the continuing 
  strength of the sailors' movement. (54) <br>
  <br>
  Mutinies in the forces of intervention were not confined to the Navy. There 
  was a large mutiny in a Marine battalion at Murmansk. The 6th Battalion of the 
  Royal Marines, formed in the summer of 1919 at a time of unrest over demobilisation, 
  were originally intended to police Schleswig Holstein. But, at short notice, 
  the Battalion had been diverted to cover the evacuation of Murmansk. They were 
  sent to the Lake Onega region, a further 300 miles south of Kem. In August 1919 
  two companies refused duty : 90 men were tried and found guilty of mutiny by 
  a court martial. 13 men were sentenced to death and others to up to 5 years 
  imprisonment. <br>
  <br>
  None of the death sentences were actually carried out. The ninety mutineers 
  were shipped to Bodmin prison, where they continued their resistance to arbitrary 
  authority. (In this they were acting in the best traditions of the Royal Marines. 
  In December 1918 some Marines had been involved in a mutiny inside Bodmin prison 
  which had resulted in three death sentences, later commuted to five years penal 
  servitude.) Continued resistance paid off. The ninety men arrested after the 
  Murmansk incident had their sentences reduced as follows : the 13 sentenced 
  to death were commuted to five years, but 12 were released after only one year, 
  and the other after two years. Twenty men, originally given 5 years, were released 
  after six months. Fifty one men sentenced to two years were also released within 
  six months. <br>
  <br>
  In recognition of the fact that their officers had acted contrary to Army instructions 
  in employing young and inexperienced lads at the front, the remainder of those 
  arrested were either released or had their sentences commuted to 6 months. Following 
  the announcement, on December 22, 19 of these acts of 'clemency' the First Lord 
  of the Admiralty told the Commons that 'bad leadership' was a factor behind 
  the mutiny. He even hinted at the possibility of disciplinary measures being 
  taken against several officers. <br>
  <br>
  Many other mutinies occurred in North Russia. One took place in the 13th Battalion 
  of the Yorkshire Regiment, which ended with death sentences being passed on 
  two sergeants whilst the other mutineers were cowed by White Russian machine 
  gunners called in by the English officers. <br>
  <br>
  News of these mutinies was suppressed. They highlighted the reluctance of British 
  sailors to fight against Russia when the government was theoretically committed 
  to a policy of peace. Contrary to what the people were being told, and at the 
  very moment when the hysteria surrounding the Armistice was at its height, the 
  Foreign Office and Admiralty were finalising their arrangements for intervention 
  in Russia. <br>
  <br>
  The Navy was not only required for the anti-Bolshevik crusade and to defend 
  Britain's imperial commitments. It was also needed to quell internal disturbances. 
  Towards the end of the 1914-1918 war seamen were trained in the noble art of 
  'blacklegging' in the event of strikes by railwaymen or power workers. 'The 
  battleship Vanguard', says Walter Kendall, 'was sent to the Mersey to command 
  Liverpool during the Police strike of August 1919'. (56) <br>
  <br>
  Resistance in the Navy continued between 1919 and the time of the Invergordon 
  mutiny. (57) In 1930 there were no fewer than six major movements within the 
  Navy against conditions of work and the arbitrary injustice of naval discipline. 
  The 'Revenge', 'Royal Oak', Vindictive', 'Repulse', 'Ramillies' and 'Lucia' 
  were all affected. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>THE RUSSIAN FRONT </strong><br>
  <br>
  There is some evidence of fraternisation between Russian revolutionaries and 
  the allied armies sent to put them down, even in the Northern Sector. In December 
  1918 an occupation of the barracks by Russians of the First Archangel Company, 
  who were sympathetic to the revolution, was supported by fraternising allied 
  troops, who picketed the town so as to shut it off from the barracks. The mutiny 
  was suppressed when Russian NCOs, under British command, mortared the barracks, 
  killing at least one innocent civilian bystander. <br>
  <br>
  In February 1919 men of the Yorkshire Regiment refused to march on Seletskoe. 
  Two sergeants, delegated to express the battalion's refusal to fight, were arrested, 
  court-martialled and sentenced to be shot. In the light of 'secret' orders from 
  the King prohibiting executions after the Armistice, these sentences were later 
  commuted to life imprisonment. News of the Yorkshire's mutiny spread rapidly 
  through the allied forces. The first to follow suit were the French battalion 
  at Archangel, who refused to return from leave. <br>
  <br>
  Much has been said about the determination of Russian workers to protect the 
  revolution from the Western allies. What has rarely been recorded is how weak 
  the Bolshevik armed forces were. When clashes with the allied Navy occurred, 
  Bolshevik commanders often surrendered immediately. And the few planes the RAF 
  had commandeered easily took command of the air. In one instance an RAF pilot 
  was able to follow a Bolshevik plane to its aerodrome and land there, after 
  shooting it up, before making a safe return. The ultimate Bolshevik military 
  victory was not due to the superiority of Lenin's forces in the field, but to 
  the decision of the Allies to pull out - a decision largely influenced by the 
  mood of their own soldiers. Major setbacks on the battlefield were largely due 
  to vast numbers of Whites going over to the other side, rather than the superior 
  forces of the Bolshevik armies. <br>
  <br>
  In June 1919, in spite of the fact that the Bolshevik forces on the Dvina were 
  on their knees, the Hampshire Regiment refused contact and withdrew from the 
  battle. To prevent similar acts of indiscipline the ringleaders were sent home 
  for demobilisation. Maintaining discipline, however, proved to be more difficult 
  than it was thought. On July 7 the Slavo-British Legion, which had been at Dvina 
  for only 3 days, mutinied, killing five British officers and four Russian officers. 
  Several mutineers called for volunteers to join the Bolsheviks and some 50 did 
  so, another 50 deserting. Two of the mutineers were captured, tried and shot. 
  The rest of the battalion was disarmed and turned into a labour unit. <br>
  <br>
  The situation in Russia was unique. Here was an army inflicting heavy losses 
  on the Bolshevik forces, breaking through their lines with relative ease, and 
  yet, from the reports of mutinies, it was evident that the whole Archangel force 
  might easily collapse. It is against this background that we can understand 
  the decision to withdraw allied troops from Russia. By September 1919 the evacuation 
  of an army, scarcely damaged by Bolshevik forces, was well under way. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>MUTINY AT KINMEL PARK CAMP</strong> <br>
  <br>
  In the autumn of 1918 Kinmel Park Camp (and its hospital) were assigned to the 
  Canadian authorities, under Camp Commandant M.A. Colquhoun. The camp was to 
  be a 'concentration area', conveniently situated in North Wales, only a few 
  miles from Liverpool and its docks. The only trouble was that the authorities 
  showed little intention of doing any demobilising. <br>
  <br>
  Weeks passed. Few men left for home. Day after day the authorities told the 
  men that their ships had been cancelled, laying the blame upon striking dockworkers. 
  But they did not explain how it was possible for American and Australian troops 
  to sail for home, in their thousands, each week. <br>
  <br>
  Conditions at Kinmel Park were unspeakable. The living standards of the 'returning 
  heroes' were inferior to those in enemy prison camps. Men were sleeping on damp 
  and draughty floors, with very few blankets. There was insufficient coal for 
  fires. The food was described as little better than pigswill. <br>
  <br>
  The soldiers in the camp had been involved in some of the heaviest fighting 
  of the war. Yet, instead of victory parades and peacetime celebrations, they 
  were obliged to watch their comrades die of influenza. Equally rankling was 
  the discrepancy Ln the scale of wartime pensions between officers and the ranks. 
  'I had my pension fixed at $600', a blind veteran was to tell his comrades in 
  1920. 'I want to know how it is that the eyes of a Brigadier-General in Canada 
  are worth $2700, while my eyes are only worth $600'. <br>
  <br>
  One of the immediate grievances was that recruits who had only just come over 
  from Canada were being sent back first. From the end of 1916 it had been accepted 
  that the disbandment of Canadian troops would Cake place on a 'first in, first 
  out' basis, modified by marital status. But this was fiercely opposed by General 
  Currie and Sir Robert Borden who, along with other senior officers, secretly 
  longed for the preservation of the Canadian Forces on an armed footing beyond 
  the Armistice. Currie's views were overruled by the Privy Council, but Borden 
  pressured Sir Thomas White (acting Canadian Prime Minister) to reconsider Currie's 
  plan to retain the troops until they could be returned in complete units. The 
  Currie plan was eventually accepted, amid great administrative confusion. <br>
  <br>
  Dissatisfaction in the camp grew, aggravated by the news of every ship cancellation. 
  It was becoming clear that the economic prospects for returning troops were 
  grim and that this was an important factor in delaying their demobilisation. 
  There were gloomy reports from troops who had returned concerning discrimination 
  in the job market in favour of officers. <br>
  <br>
  Severe unemployment in Canada was coupled with an aggressive anti-working class 
  policy. There were 12,000 unemployed in Montreal alone, and a similar number 
  in Toronto. The Canadian war debt stood at over 400 million. As usual the working 
  classes were expected to make the necessary 'sacrifices' for economic recovery. 
  Lay-offs and wage cuts led to industrial unrest. Some troops sent to quell rioting 
  strikers had started to fraternise with them. Returning soldiers were adding 
  fuel to flames, presenting a very serious threat to the status quo. <br>
  <br>
  On the whole, Canadian trade union leaders sided with the authorities. As a 
  result they were ignored by the rank and file. Tom Moore, President of the Canadian 
  Trades and Labour Congress, was booed off the platform at a public meeting in 
  Toronto. During the war Orders in Council had prohibited meetings of socialists 
  and the circulation of socialist literature. Heavy sentences had been imposed 
  for breach of this law. The Canadian authorities held that 'aliens' (mainly 
  Russian immigrants) were violating these Orders in Council. Plans were produced 
  for the deportation of these 'aliens'. <br>
  <br>
  Early in 1919 the 'aliens' had held a mass meeting and drawn up the following 
  statement: 'We do not wish to be sent to England as strike-breakers. Nor do 
  we want to be compelled to take up arms against our own people. Let us leave 
  Canada as free agents, just as we came, to go where we will. We appeal to the 
  workers of Canada and to the soldiers to protect themselves by seeing that justice 
  is done to us. Our cause, in reality, is their cause - for they will have to 
  combat the same elements in the endeavour to make the world better for themselves 
  and their children'. (58) <br>
  <br>
  This protest was circulated to workers and to troops, and was translated into 
  seven languages. <br>
  <br>
  News of these events, and of the ill-treatment of the 'aliens', filtered back 
  to the Canadians at Kinmel. The unbearable situation in the camp and the depressing 
  news from home combined to ripen the conditions for mutiny. The final straw 
  was the arrival of newspapers from home carrying pictures of a hero's welcome 
  being given to soldiers who had seen no fighting at all. <br>
  <br>
  On Tuesday March 4, 1919 a meeting was held by the soldiers of Montreal Camp. 
  A strike committee was elected. On it was a young Russian called William Tarasevich 
  (often referred to in the press as Tarashaitch or Tarouke). He was picked to 
  give the signal to start the mutiny. The objective was to take over each of 
  the 21 camps, between them involving 15,000 to 20,000 men. <br>
  <br>
  The newspapers gave contradictory reports of what happened. On March 7, 1919, 
  The Times ran a story under the headline: 'Riot in Canadian Camp: Twelve Killed 
  and Many Injured. VC Trampled to Death'. <br>
  <br>
  'A serious disturbance by Canadian soldiers occurred at Kinmel Military Camp, 
  near Rhyl, on Tuesday and Wednesday. As a result twelve lives were lost, including 
  that of a Major of New Brunswick who had gained the VC. About twenty others 
  were injured. In addition damage estimated at 50,000 was done to the camp. 
  ' <br>
  <br>
  The article went on to describe how Kinmel was a dispersal camp for Canadian 
  soldiers, waiting for ships to take them home. It pointed out that the men in 
  the camp were mainly from France. During the last year they had been through 
  some of the fiercest fighting. Their patience had been exhausted during the 
  weeks of delay at Kinmel. The article continued: <br>
  <br>
  'On Tuesday night, the men held a mass meeting, which was followed by a mad 
  riot. The outbreak began in Montreal Camp at 9.30 pm with a cry ''Come on the 
  Bolsheviks", which is said to have been given by a Canadian soldier who is Russian. 
  The men rushed to the officers' quarters, helped themselves to all the liquor 
  they could find, then went for the stores, disarmed the guards, and with their 
  rifles smashed doors and windows, helping themselves to the content of the stores. 
  Boxes of cigarettes and cigars were thrown all about the ground. Then they went 
  out to wreck the whole camp. One portion, where tradesmen's shops supplied soldiers, 
  was stripped and in a few moments not a shop was left standing. The Church Army 
  and Salvation Army buildings, however, were not touched. The rioters then proceeded 
  to the quarters occupied by the girls, who were in bed, and carried away their 
  clothes. The girls were not injured, but had to remain in bed the next day because 
  they could not dress themselves. Next day, the rioters were masquerading about 
  the camp in girls' clothing. <br>
  <br>
  By mid-day on Wednesday the camp appeared as if it had been passed over by legions 
  of tanks. Unfortunately a brewer's dray containing 48 barrels of beer arrived 
  at the camp. The men took fire buckets, broke the barrels and drank the beer. 
  Then they started shooting all round. In one of the distant parts of the camp 
  a young soldier stood on guard and attempted to do his duty. In reply to his 
  challenge one of the rioters shot him dead. <br>
  <br>
  A little later a major from New Brunswick, who had gained the VC, attempted 
  to interfere, but in his endeavour to hold the rioters back from such portion 
  of the officers' quarters that was not demolished, he was thrown down and trampled 
  to death. Another officer, going amongst the rioters, was so badly mauled that 
  he died a few hours later. <br>
  <br>
  During this time some of the men had been arrested. The rioters demanded the 
  release of the men. The colonel refused, and the rioters released the men themselves. 
  The whole disturbance was quelled by night and the ringleaders, numbering about 
  twenty, and stated to be mostly of foreign extraction, were taken away. The 
  Canadian soldiers in the camp, while explaining the cause of the affair, are 
  now regretting it. They say that they did not anticipate that it would go to 
  such lengths, and the mob went further than it meant to. <br>
  <br>
  The disturbance caused great alarm in Rhyl, when it was reported that 5,000 
  to 6,000 men of the camp were going to raze the town. <br>
  <br>
  Yesterday an officer from the War Office arrived at the camp by aeroplane and 
  found everything calm. He addressed the men, telling them it was murder for 
  Canadians to kill Canadians. He gave them an assurance that within a few days 
  about half of the Canadians in the camp should be on their way home. The others 
  would follow quickly. This statement was cheered by the men who said it was 
  all they wanted.' <br>
  <br>
  This is a neat, compact story informing the country of a riot by drunken Canadians 
  led by a Russian. Private property had been damaged. Drunken soldiers had gone 
  on a blood-spilling orgy, firing their guns and trampling someone to death. 
  Not an ordinary soldier, but (oh, horror!)an officer with a VC. <br>
  <br>
  Things hadn't been quite that simple. News of the mutiny reached Parliament. 
  On Monday March 10, 1919 at question time, Mr Me Master asked the Secretary 
  of State for War 'whether he could make a statement regarding the regrettable 
  discontent and breach of discipline amongst soldiers at a Welsh camp awaiting 
  shipment to their homes, on conclusion of long and meritorious service in the 
  field'. Captain Guest, Joint Parliamentary Secretary for the Treasury, replied: 
  <br>
  <br>
  'A court of inquiry has been set up by the Canadian Military Authorities to 
  investigate thoroughly the whole affair. I think the House will agree with me 
  that as the matter is sub judice it would be improper for me to make a statement. 
  The Canadian Military Authorities have issued a statement which was published 
  in Saturday morning's papers'. A statement had appeared in The Times on the 
  morning of Saturday, March 8. Under the headline : 'The Camp Riot: Further Details', 
  the article 'stated : <br>
  <br>
  'All was quiet yesterday at Kinmel Park, North Wales. It was officially stated 
  that the casualties were five killed and twenty one wounded. The inquest on 
  the victims was opened yesterday, and adjourned until next week. Brigadier General 
  M. A. Colquhoun, in a statement yesterday morning, said that no attack was made 
  on the officers who were treated with the greatest courtesy. "I myself", he 
  went on to say, "went in and out amongst the men freely. Some of them actually 
  put down their loot in order to salute me, and then picked up their loot again. 
  Reports of the damage are greatly exaggerated. Some fifty or sixty men got out 
  of hand, and attacked some canteens. The men in one camp, anticipating danger, 
  armed themselves and, contrary to express orders, fired. That was on Wednesday, 
  when the fatalities occurred. The girls' camp was not attacked. As a matter 
  of fact the girls were treated with the utmost chivalry. No man entered the 
  girls' bedrooms while they were occupied. One man raised the red flag in an 
  attempt to introduce Bolshevism, but was shot". <br>
  <br>
  In view of the splendid discipline and record uniformly maintained by Canadian 
  troops since the beginning of the war in England and France, the "incident" 
  at Kinmel Park is regretted. It is considered that by comparison with others 
  discipline amongst the Canadian troops is of a high order. It is also regretted 
  that reports of the incident have been exaggerated. Immediately after the Armistice, 
  Kinmel Park was secured as a concentration area through which Canadian troops 
  stationed near Liverpool could pass through to Canada. All documentation is 
  completed there, and the troops are sorted into drafts, according to their destination 
  in Canada. Considering the shortage of shipping, the Canadian authorities congratulate 
  themselves upon the splendid record they have for sending troops to Canada. 
  <br>
  <br>
  In the month of February (1919), however, the Ministry of Shipping were unable 
  to furnish sufficient ships to carry out the programme as promised to the Canadians. 
  Owing to this the programme in February and early March had fallen short by 
  one third. This had caused the "backing up" of troops from Kinmel Park through 
  to areas in England, through to France. This had caused disappointment to the 
  Canadians, some of whom had been overseas, without seeing home, for four years 
  . . . <br>
  <br>
  Immediately upon the matter being reported to the Chief of the General Staff, 
  Lieutenant General Sir Richard Turner VC, KCB, he went to Kinmel Park and addressed 
  the men in fifteen different places. They seemed to appreciate his explanations 
  and there is not likely to be any further disturbances ... <br>
  <br>
  If the number of men originally planned for February had been allowed to embark, 
  it is thought that there would have been no trouble. But the shipping situation, 
  owing to strikes and other reasons, is admittedly a difficult matter to control. 
  It is however hoped that there will not be a recurrence of the delays which 
  have hitherto taken place. <br>
  <br>
  It is not attempted, in the slightest degree, to excuse the misconduct of the 
  men who took part in the disturbance. Many of the offenders have already been 
  placed under arrest and these, with others involved, will be rigorously dealt 
  with. <br>
  <br>
  During the disturbance a certain amount of damage was done, and it was discovered 
  that civilians were concerned. Up to the present twelve of these civilians have 
  been arrested and handed over to the local authorities. (My emphasis - DL) (58a) 
  <br>
  <br>
  During the disturbance three rioters were killed and two men on picket duty. 
  Twenty one soldiers were wounded, of whom two were officers. There is no foundation 
  to the report that a Major, who was a VC, was killed or injured. The troops 
  at Kinmel Park are concentrated in units representing the military districts 
  of Canada to which they will proceed. They are not in their original units, 
  these wings being composite formations consisting of personnel belonging to 
  many different units. This sorting out is done in deference to the wishes of 
  the authorities in Canada, in order to avoid delay when they reach the Dominion. 
  <br>
  <br>
  A court of inquiry, of which Brigadier J.O.MacBrian CB, CMG, DSO, is President, 
  has been convened to make a thorough investigation into all circumstances in 
  connexion with the disturbance". (From the Ministry of Overseas Forces of Canada.) 
  This statement was backed by a Times editorial which praised the previous disciplinary 
  record of the Canadian Army, adding that <br>
  <br>
  'discipline to an army is what honour is to a woman. Once lost it can never 
  be restored'. (59) <br>
  <br>
  A closer look at the official statement is warranted. It argues that dissatisfaction 
  over the failure to obtain ships had led to the disturbance. This was a feeble 
  excuse. Throughout the winter of 1918-19, at a time of high unemployment, over 
  1000 ships were standing idle, awaiting repair. (60) No attempt was made to 
  secure the use of neutral ships for the repatriation of Canadian troops. This 
  could only have meant that the authorities had other plans for them, such as 
  sending them to Russia. Or it might have meant that the Canadian government, 
  troubled by militancy and unrest at home, were not eager to add a lot of soldiers 
  - many with revolutionary ideas - to the melting pot of grievances. <br>
  <br>
  On Monday March 10 The Times retracted its first account of the mutiny. Under 
  a very small 'Editor's note' the following appeared: <br>
  <br>
  'We are requested by Major C. Stephenson, commanding Number Four Military District 
  Concentration Wing Camp 16 (Montreal Camp), Kinmel Park, Rhyl, who writes on 
  behalf of the officers, NCOs and men of Montreal Camp to contradict the statement 
  which appeared in The Times on Friday, that the recent outbreak began in Montreal 
  District Camp. The Montreal officers, NCOs and men in fact gave all their efforts 
  to, and were largely responsible for, the quelling of the rioters. We are glad 
  to publish this authoritative denial, which was written before the issue of 
  the official account of the outbreak, and the more reassuring version which 
  we published from our special correspondent on Saturday. It is to be regretted 
  that the authorities were unable to issue their official statement a day earlier'. 
  (61) From this and other accounts in the press it is obvious that everything 
  was being done to minimise the incident. This is not surprising in view of the 
  precarious situation then pertaining in the British Army. It was certainly unwise 
  from the point of view of the authorities to give any credence to reports of 
  any political motivation behind the mutiny. The net result was a series of inaccurate 
  reports, followed by denials. Serious readers must have been left completely 
  baffled. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>KINMEL: A RECONSTRUCTION </strong><br>
  <br>
  What follows is an attempt to reconstruct what really happened during the Kinmel 
  mutiny. The sworn statements of people who participated in the events of March 
  4 and 5, 1919 are recorded in the minutes of the Coroner's Inquest held on March 
  20, 1919. (The transcript is available in the County Records Office, Hawarden, 
  Clwyd.) Some of the accounts require close examination, for they point to very 
  obvious contradictions in the officers' testimonies. <br>
  <br>
  On the evening of March 4 the men held a meeting during which they elected delegates. 
  At a given signal they took over several of the camps. There was a minimum of 
  violence and no firearms were used. The majority of the troops supported the 
  mutiny. By 10.30 pm most of the camps were in a state of open revolt. The 'Tin 
  Town Stores' were occupied. The officers were powerless and offered no resistance. 
  There was little or no looting. <br>
  <br>
  One officer, Lieutenant G. Gauthier, who saw the initial outbreak, was allowed 
  to return unmolested to Camps 19 and 20 (these two camps, which housed a number 
  of officers, were the only two not occupied by the mutineers). There, he prepared 
  his fellow officers for resistance. The following morning Gauthier, minus his 
  badges, mingled with the men, posing as a private. His aim was to identify 'leaders', 
  so that at the earliest opportunity they could be separated from the rank-and-file. 
  Meanwhile, the officers and 'loyal' men of Camps 19 and 20 were completing their 
  defence arrangements, setting up pickets at strategic points. A guard of 50 
  men had already spent the night at the entrance to Camp 20, preventing any contact 
  between the inmates and mutineers from other camps. <br>
  <br>
  On March 5, at 14. 15 hrs. Lieutenant Gauthier approached a group of soldiers 
  standing outside the Bakery and warned them to keep away from Camp 20. The men 
  sent him retreating under a barrage of stones, jeers and catcalls. <br>
  <br>
  At 2.30 pm the mutineers assembled and an advance party led the way towards 
  Camps 19 and 20. This group was itself led by two men carrying a red flag on 
  two poles. Three other men carried smaller red flags which they used to give 
  signals to the main body of men, some way behind. The advance party approached 
  the officers of Camps 19 and 20 and attempted to negotiate. No negotiations 
  ever took place. As they approached, an officer was seen to give an order. A 
  group of guards immediately attacked the advance party of mutineers, capturing 
  several of them. The prisoners were dragged off to the Guardhouse In Camp 20. 
  <br>
  <br>
  This action delayed the advance of the main body of mutineers. But they continued 
  to come on, armed with a few stones and rifle butts. <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile the officers and guards were entrenched around Camp 20, the Records 
  Office and the Guard Room. The mutineers tried to force their way into the Guard 
  Room and release the prisoners. The attempt was beaten off. The mutineers then 
  took up positions in Camp 18, facing the officers. <br>
  <br>
  George Copley, a Company Sergeant Major in the Royal Engineers, made the following 
  written deposition: <br>
  <br>
  'At 2.30 pm I saw a number of rioters enter the gateway of Camp 20. Two men 
  were leading, with a red flag on two poles. The crowd went to the Guard Room 
  and I could hear their leaders say "Let's have them out". Stones were thrown 
  through the windows of the Guard Room and two or three of their leaders seized 
  fire buckets from their hooks and smashed the windows with them. Then they moved 
  off towards No. 18 Camp canteen. Shortly afterwards I saw a crowd collect near 
  the roadway and make a rush between the huts of No. 18 Camp. They were armed 
  with sticks and stones and one or two rifles. I noticed that one of the rifles 
  had a bayonet fixed. Immediately afterwards, I heard shots coming from the direction 
  of No. 20 Camp - I advised my staff to take cover, which they did.' That the 
  firing was started by the officers is borne out by the following statement from 
  an independent eye-witness. Mr William Spicer, a representative of the firm 
  of Balfour Beatty & Co. , War Department Agents. He wrote : <br>
  <br>
  'I saw a number of rioters coming through Camp 18 mess huts towards No. 20 Camp. 
  When they saw the soldiers standing outside the Guardhouse they stopped. They 
  lingered about for some time, then got orders from the direction of Camp 20. 
  The rioters still remained. Then the soldiers of Camp 20 charged. The rioters 
  resisted with sticks and stones. But I saw one rifle amongst the rioters. After 
  a few minutes' pause the soldiers from Camp 20 returned back to their trenches. 
  One soldier was wounded by the Blacksmith's Shop and was taken away by others. 
  <br>
  <br>
  A soldier came down towards the Blacksmith's Shop and said to two other soldiers 
  standing by me : "who done the firing?" The two soldiers replied: "that lot 
  from Camp 20". He then said to his pals: "wait here until I come back, I know 
  where I can get some rifles". Not long after this there was another charge by 
  the men from Camp 20 at the mutineers (who were now armed with a few rifles). 
  One rioter was taken prisoner and marched towards Camp 20. The rioters then 
  cleared back into other camps'. Another eye-witness, Arthur D. Abel, also of 
  Balfour Beatty & Co. , confirmed that the officers had attacked first. Apparently 
  quite a lot of firing took place. Those in Camp 20 were indiscriminate in their 
  choice of targets. Jack Merritt, a driver" in the Canadian Field Artillery, 
  said: <br>
  <br>
  'At 3 pm I was with a gunner called Jack Hickman. We were between the two huts 
  in the lines at No. IS Camp. As we were standing talking together he was struck 
  by a bullet and fell. He did not speak, dying almost immediately. At the time 
  a number of soldiers were firing on Camp 19. He was therefore struck by a stray 
  bullet as he was not taking part in the disturbances'. (62) Concerning the same 
  episode Robert Bowie, a Lance-Corporal in the Royal Engineers assigned to Camp 
  18, testified that he was in huts 21 and 25 of Camp 18 when two Canadian soldiers 
  came running along the duck-boards, one with a rifle and fixed bayonet, the 
  other with a stick. When they got to the corner of the hut one of them turned 
  round and looked back and was struck by a bullet. He then fell at Bowie's feet. 
  The latter carried him into hut 21. During the next few minutes several bullets 
  entered the building but there were no further casualties. <br>
  <br>
  Let us now look at the evidence given by officers and NCOs from Camp 20. Their 
  statements at the forementioned inquest on the five men killed during the Kinmel 
  mutiny. <br>
  <br>
  They were not submitted as evidence at the inquest, however (i.e. those who 
  made the statements were not liable to cross-examination). Three days before 
  the inquest, on March 17 1919 the Coroner had received a note from the Canadian 
  President of the Canadian Army's Court of Inquiry saying: 'I regret very much 
  that I cannot furnish you with any statements from officers, which you ask for, 
  as our proceedings are confidential and cannot be made public at present'. <br>
  <br>
  Superintendent Lindsay of Rhyl Constabulary had however managed to obtain some 
  statements without the knowledge of the Canadian authorities. They were marked 
  CONFIDENTIAL. Today they comprise the only existing 'official' record of the 
  events. The evidence contained in these statements concerning the use of firearms 
  does not square with what was said by the civilian witnesses. <br>
  <br>
  According to Sergeant E.V. Collier, DSO, 'at about 13. 00 hrs organised bodies 
  of men approached Camp 20 across the open space of ground opposite Camp 20 Orderly 
  Room. The men were advancing carrying a red flag, in open orders and under leaders. 
  They were armed, firing live ammunition. Twice they were driven back by Camp 
  20 men and we were able to assist MD1 on the rioters' left flank and front. 
  After the capture of some of the leaders, the white flag was shown and altogether 
  about 22 rioters were captured. Two went to hospital and five left in a lorry 
  under escort. The balance were dealt with by MD1.' <br>
  <br>
  Attached to the statement was a list of names of the rioters dealt with by Officers. 
  Unfortunately this roll is not now available. It would have provided crucial 
  information as to the fate of those who took part in the mutiny. Where is this 
  roll today? What light could it throw on the mystery still hanging over the 
  affair? In St. Margaret's Church at Bodelwyddan (near the camp) are 83 Canadian 
  graves. The official explanation is that the men died during the influenza epidemic 
  of 1918-19. But rumours still circulate amongst local inhabitants that in some 
  of these graves lie the bodies of mutineers, executed after the events of March 
  1919. We know 75 arrests were made (some reports say 79). Whilst the dates on 
  the headstones vary, several of them record death as having occurred in March 
  1919. Whether or not any of those arrested lie in these graves we may never 
  know. But amongst the graves of the 'influenza' victims are stones bearing the 
  names of Tarasevich, Glllan, Young and Haney, all of whom met with violent deaths. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The following statement comes from W. H. Bremmer, the Provost Sergeant of Department 
  6, Camp 19. It was submitted to his superior officer on March 7, 1919 : <br>
  <br>
  'On Wednesday 5th March (time 14.30 hrs) the rioters marched on Camp 20. They 
  started to raid the Officers' Mess and were immediately set upon by the boys 
  of Camp 20. A few were arrested and placed in the Guard Room of Camp 20, the 
  remainder making good their escape across the opposite field. <br>
  <br>
  The rioters reorganised and marched on towards Camp 20, with rifles, etc. I 
  was standing talking alongside Mr Carlisle when he told me to go along with 
  him. I did so, and joined in the attack against the rioters, capturing one of 
  them whom I marched to the Guard Room. I then returned and found the rioters 
  using live ammunition. I returned to the Guard Room and got a rifle and four 
  rounds of ammunition. But when I got back the boys had charged and rushed the 
  rioters back to the rear of ASC. The rioters charged and rushed back to Camp 
  20. A number of shots were fired from Camp 20, inflicting casualties amongst 
  the rioters. When they were beaten they hoisted the white flag. I immediately 
  rushed out and placed under arrest all the men that I noticed to be with the 
  rioters. I had some escorted back to Camp 19 Guard Room, where all the valuables 
  were taken off them. One of my prisoners went to hospital and the remaining 
  5 were handed over to the Regimental Sergeant Major'. Sergeant Bremmer then 
  stated that he had obtained ammunition and that his men were actually firing 
  at the mutineers. This is corroborated by another eye-witness, Captain Douglas 
  Forbes-Scott: <br>
  <br>
  'At 14.30 I went down to the Camp Orderly Room. Camp 20 men were lined up in 
  a defensive position in and on the trenches alongside the road. Opposite the 
  ASC stable the rioters were lined up. Camps 19 and 20 charged over the ground 
  and brought back some of the rioters. They went over a second time and were 
  met with rifle fire. Three of them (the mutineers - DL) were hit and they hoisted 
  the white flag. Previously they had been displaying the red flag and urging 
  men to attack the camp. I afterwards heard of the death of Private Gillan by 
  one of the rioters.' Private Gillan was killed in the battle with the mutineers 
  after the initial fighting. His death occurred when the mutineers obtained weapons 
  after the first attack from Camp 20. Sergeant Henry Roberts of Camp 19 testified 
  as follows : <br>
  <br>
  'On Wednesday at 3.30 pm I was one of a party detailed by MD6 to repel the rioters 
  who were endeavouring to invade the camp. Private David Gillan and myself along 
  with several others advanced across the training ground towards AS Corps stables 
  where the rioters were hiding. Many of them were advancing carrying the red 
  flag, in open order, under leaders, and were armed, firing live ammunition. 
  Twice they were driven back by Camp 19 and 20 men. After the capture of some 
  of their leaders a white flag was shown. Of the 22 rioters captured, 7 were 
  by us, and fifteen were captured by Military District No. L, Camp 20. During 
  the fight Private David Gillan was struck by a bullet In the neck. I saw one 
  of the rioters deliberately taking aim in a kneeling position. But just then 
  another party came from behind and we fled, leaving Gillan'. According to the 
  medical evidence submitted to the inquest, Gillan was shot in the back. If this 
  was the case it could mean that the bullet came from the direction of Camp 20 
  since his back was turned in that direction. We have already seen evidence as 
  to the use of firearms by the officers and men of Camp 20. <br>
  <br>
  Many arrests were made during the hours following the battle. Gradually the 
  authorities retained control. Seventy five men were eventually taken away and 
  charged with mutiny. Following a Court of Inquiry, presided over by Major-General 
  Sir H.E. Burstall, KCB, CMC, there was a court-martial, presided over by the 
  same General Burstall. Between April 16 and June 7, 1919 Burstall tried 38 cases, 
  involving 50 prisoners charged with mutiny and other offences. Seventeen were 
  acquitted, 27 convicted of mutiny. Six more were found guilty of minor charges. 
  Sentences ranged from 90 days to ten years. It is difficult to find out what 
  happened to the others. Were they released? Did they die of 'influenza'? It 
  appears that all the leaders were arrested, with the exception of the 'Russian' 
  : Sapper William Tarasevich. His stomach was ripped out with a bayonet, by 'persons 
  unknown'. On that same afternoon four other men are known to have died: namely 
  David Gillan, Jack Hickman, Corporal Joseph Young and Gunner William Lyie Haney. 
  <br>
  <br>
  At the inquest on March 20, 1919 the medical evidence concerning the causes 
  of death was as follows : <br>
  <br>
  - Corporal Joseph Young, aged 38, died MMarch 5, 1919 at the Military Hospital, 
  Kinmel Camp, from the effect of a bayonet wound in the head. - William Lyie 
  Haney died, aged 22, at KKinmel Camp, from a bullet wound in the head. <br>
  <br>
  - William Tarasevich, aged 26, was killeed at Kinmel Camp, his abdomen pierced 
  by a bayonet. <br>
  <br>
  - David Gillan, aged 20, died as a resullt of being shot by a rifle. <br>
  <br>
  - Jack Hickman, aged 21, died as a resullt of being shot by a rifle. In his 
  opening address to the jury the Coroner had said that, contrary to the prevailing 
  rumours, he was satisfied that the Canadian authorities would place all their 
  information at the disposal of the Court. Yet, as we have pointed out, he had 
  received a note from the Canadian President of the Court of Inquiry stating 
  that its proceedings were 'confidential'. The Coroner assured the jury that 
  the Canadian authorities would allow facilities for witnesses to come forward. 
  This promise was never kept. The hearing was a travesty, even of its own limited 
  terms of reference. What were the Establishment trying to hide? Many witnesses 
  had been spirited away with the 5000 Canadian soldiers who sailed the previous 
  week on the White Star liner 'Olympic'. We know that the local police had issued 
  a summons for Sapper 249685 M. Chaka (of Camp 11) to attend as a key witness. 
  The summons was returned by the Canadian authorities with a note explaining 
  that Chaka had sailed for Canada on March 13 and would therefore be unable to 
  attend. <br>
  <br>
  The Coroner concluded his opening address with the warning that 'as proceedings 
  develop, it may appear that one or more persons may become open to accusations 
  of having been criminally responsible for the deaths of these men'. But that 
  was as far as he would venture. <br>
  <br>
  That very morning he had received a telegram from the Home Office informing 
  him that 'the Canadian authorities are investigating the matter and intend to 
  try by Court-Martial any person found criminally responsible'. <br>
  <br>
  Although they put in a nominal appearance at the inquest the Canadian authorities 
  were determined to handle the matter themselves. In the witness box Major C.W. 
  Maclean testified how he saw the mutineers approach, led by the red flag. Following 
  the initial stone-throwing he had been called to an orderly room to communicate 
  with Headquarters. When he returned Private Gillan was dead: shot. Maclean then 
  went to his Headquarters and stayed there until 5 pm. He added that the previous 
  night he had received an 'intimation' that there was going to be trouble. When 
  asked whether the rioters were armed, he admitted that he did not see any of 
  them with complete rifles. Those with guns had their stocks broken - the guns 
  being used as clubs. His own party had been given 40 rifles. These had been 
  served out at the 1.30 pm parade, as a precaution. But, Maclean said, no ammunition 
  was supplied since there was none in the camp. Initially bayonets were not fixed. 
  He had given express orders to protect the Record Office : company commanders 
  were left to take whatever action they deemed necessary. <br>
  <br>
  Concluding his evidence the Major confirmed that 75 prisoners had been taken. 
  Of the five dead men, only one was 'on his side'. He could not be sure whether 
  the other men killed were rioters or lookers-on. <br>
  <br>
  Lieutenant Gauthier also gave evidence. He said that Camp 20 was the last camp 
  to be attacked. In all the other camps an organised defence had failed. He had 
  particularly wanted to protect the Records Office, as all other records in the 
  camp had been destroyed. When questioned about the shooting he testified that 
  his men had disobeyed his orders. <br>
  <br>
  This evidence was contradicted by the next witness, Major E.V. Collier. Collier 
  claimed that the mutineers were the first to fire. They were led by one man: 
  a Russian. When questioned as to the cause of the mutiny he replied that drink 
  had helped to aggravate it. He knew of no dissatisfaction. A juryman asked him 
  directly what its cause was. <br>
  <br>
  He replied: 'part Russian, part drink'. Collier then described how, the previous 
  day, expecting trouble, he had summoned his men and cautioned them not to use 
  ammunition. A Juryman asked him why he bothered to caution them, since the previous 
  witness had just said there was no ammunition in the camp. Collier replied: 
  'perhaps they might have brought some back from France, as souvenirs'. <br>
  <br>
  The ammunition question was finally resolved when Major St George (Assistant 
  Provost Marshall) said that 'no ammunition was given out. It was all stored 
  in one place and the rioters never got at it'. <br>
  <br>
  The evidence of Sergeant Bremmer reveals that there was ammunition available 
  in the Guard Room of Camp 20. But it is clear that the mutineers had no access 
  to it. How much of it was given out to the officers and men defending Camp 20 
  remains a mystery. <br>
  <br>
  In his summing up the Coroner tried to cover up as best he could. He said: 'It 
  is impossible for the jury to say that any person was responsible. There are 
  contradictions in the evidence as to who fired the first shot ... I have informed 
  the Home Office that there is no evidence to conclude that criminal charges 
  should be brought against any individual'. <br>
  <br>
  The jury duly returned an open verdict. They added: <br>
  <br>
  'There is no evidence to say who inflicted the said wounds, or whether any person 
  or persons are criminally responsible for the deaths of the deceased.' <br>
  <br>
  <strong><br>
  KINMEL: AN ASSESSMENT </strong><br>
  <br>
  The fate of the Kinmel mutiny was due to a number of factors. First, the men 
  failed to prevent the officers from preparing a defence in Camps 19 and 20. 
  Lieutenant Gauthier was able to move about the camps at will, identifying ring-leaders 
  and preparing the officers' resistance. The only chance the mutineers had of 
  achieving their objective would have been to obtain complete control of the 
  whole Kinmel Park area. This should have been done on the first night, while 
  they still had the initiative. By leaving Camps 19 and 20 alone the officers 
  were given time to prepare their defences. Perhaps the most important factor 
  contributing to their defeat was that the men left communications in the hands 
  of the officers. Not every camp at Kinmel was even kept aware of the rapidly 
  evolving situation. Finally, the men underestimated the ruthlessness and determination 
  of the officers. When a mutiny is under way there can be no unarmed approaches 
  towards armed officers. Unless a mutiny is 100% solid the authorities will use 
  all means at their disposal to crush it. When 'necessary' they will not flinch 
  from bloodshed. <br>
  <br>
  On the credit side the mutiny achieved certain immediate gains. Shipping shortages 
  or no, the mutiny altered repatriation plans. Ships materialised, as if by magic. 
  Between the mutiny and March 25 some 15,000 troops left Kinmel. By the end of 
  the month some 30,000 men had been repatriated. <br>
  <br>
  The authorities had recognised that the only reliable weapon against mutiny 
  was demobilisation. Those who had participated in the events had learned something 
  of greater importance: that the war machine was not invincible. <br>
  <br>
  Outside St. Margaret's Church at Bodelwyddan, not two minutes' walk from Kinmel 
  Park, stand eighty three Canadian graves. They are arranged in four rows. 82 
  simple white slabs carry the numbers and regiments of the deceased. But there 
  is a hierarchy even in death. A red sandstone cross dominates the white slabs. 
  On it are engraved the words 'To the proud memory of Private David Gillan, who 
  was killed at Kinmel Park defending the honour of his country'. <br>
  <br>
  Of those who died defending their rights to be human beings, Corporal (438680) 
  Joseph Young, Gunner (1251417) William Lyie Haney and Sapper (1057297) William 
  Tarasevich, of the Canadian Railway Troops, lie buried side by side, in the 
  second row of graves, nearest to the church. This is a tightly packed row and 
  something strange immediately strikes one. How come the 19 men in this row lie 
  buried so near to one another, when their deaths were as widely spaced in time 
  as January 18, 1913 and April 6, 1919? (In the other three rows there is a great 
  deal more clustering in the dates of death.) Were all the dead buried where 
  they now lie, at the time of their death? Or were they reburied there, at some 
  later date? How accurate are the dates on the tombstones? Were nearly all the 
  deaths due to influenza - as the official version of events would have us believe? 
  Were no reprisals exacted on the mutineers? And what exactly do the words 'Sometime, 
  sometime, we will understand' on the tombstone of Corporal Joseph Young, really 
  mean? Opinions are divided on these and other matters. Local people, including 
  some formerly closely associated with St. Margaret's, believe that the church's 
  burial register dealing with the period of the mutiny spent a while at the War 
  Office. <br>
  <br>
  A memorial dominates the Canadian section of the little graveyard. Above the 
  maple leaf on the tombstone it proclaims : 'This memorial was erected by their 
  comrades. Their name liveth for evermore'. A strange epitaph for the victims 
  of an influenza epidemic, with only a marginal impact on the local civilian 
  population. <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>THE CANADIANS AGAIN </strong><br>
  <br>
  Kinmel was not the last mutiny amongst Canadian troops stationed in Britain. 
  Between November 1918 and June 1919 there were thirteen instances of riots and 
  mutinies involving Canadian troops. A few months after the Kinmel events the 
  authorities returned to their policy of delaying the demobilisation of Canadian 
  troops. This was a contributory factor to a mutiny at a camp in Whitley, which 
  was a repeat performance of Kinmel. On a Saturday night (June 14-15, 1919) a 
  large number of troops demonstrated against the delaying tactics of the authorities. 
  The action was sparked by the arrest of some soldiers for gambling. An attempt 
  was made to release them. This quickly flared up into a full-scale riot. The 
  main targets were the camp shops (which had a reputation for overcharging), 
  a theatre and a Salvation Army hut which were all burnt down. (63) <br>
  <br>
  According to the authorities, the delays in repatriation were due to the Liverpool 
  dock strike. But in the 'Daily Herald' (June 17, 1919) a report on the mutiny 
  stated that the soldiers' actions had had nothing to do with the Liverpool dock 
  strike. Nor was it a drunken rampage, as other newspapers had reported. An ultimatum 
  had been issued by the soldiers that further action would follow if all their 
  demands were not conceded. The authorities capitulated. <br>
  <br>
  That same week there was a riot of Canadian troops at Woodcote Park, Epsom, 
  following the arrest of some mutineers. Fierce fighting broke out between Canadian 
  troops and British police during an attempt to release the arrested men from 
  a nearby police station. In the fighting a police sergeant, Thomas Gallen, died 
  of a fractured skull. Eight Canadian soldiers were charged with manslaughter. 
  (64) <br>
  <br>
  Without doubt, there were many other such incidents. Few ever found their way 
  into the press. <br>
  <br>
  As the British authorities soon learned, even the rigours of military prison 
  did not damp the spark of mutiny. There were several instances of men convicted 
  of mutiny going on to help with the organisation of resistance in prisons. The 
  case of Private C. McDonnell, of the 3rd Canadian Machine Gun Corps, provides 
  us with a good example. He was sentenced on January 21, 1919 by a Field General 
  Court Martial to five years imprisonment on a joint charge of attempting to 
  persuade members of H.M. Forces to join a mutiny and of taking part in a mutiny. 
  He was sent to No. 7 Military Prison where he participated m another mutiny. 
  On March 24, 1919 he was sentenced to death. This sentence was later commuted 
  to life imprisonment. Another unsung hero disappeared into history. <br>
  <br>
  <strong><br>
  SUMMER AND WINTER 1919-1920 </strong><br>
  <br>
  Throughout the summer of 1919 mutinies continued to break out within the Allied 
  Forces, frustrating the War Office's attempt to maintain a significant peace-time 
  army. Mass meetings were held by soldiers serving in Kantara, Egypt, during 
  which two men from each unit were elected to form a Central Committee. The Committee's 
  task was to put forward the various grievances of the men, but it seemingly 
  confined itself to what the press described as 'legal activities'. A meeting 
  of 2500 men was recorded by a 'Daily Herald' reporter on June 4, 1919. It ended 
  peacefully with the singing of the National Anthem. Although the authorities 
  issued orders forbidding meetings of the central delegation they also made vague 
  promises about demobilisation. The promises were given a distinct sense of urgency 
  when soldiers refused to do duties and set up their own guards. Despite orders 
  forbidding meetings, the Kantara Soldiers' Council was still functioning as 
  late as June 25. <br>
  <br>
  Although a general amnesty for mutineers and other military offenders was never 
  officially endorsed, continual unrest amongst the forces created an atmosphere 
  in which the government was obliged to pursue a policy of 'clemency'. By the 
  end of December 1919 out of an aggregate of 1600 years dished out as sentences, 
  some 1200 years had been remitted. <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile repeated outbursts of mutiny in England continued to cause grave concern. 
  At Aldershot 9000 reservists had been recalled to the army because of the 'crisis' 
  caused by the coal strike and the threatened rebellion in Ireland. They proved 
  a very unwilling tool of repression. Early in May 1919 several hundred men made 
  plans for a 'rising', predicting that 'soon the red flag will be flying over 
  this town'. On Friday, May 6 a skirmish took place during which Superintendent 
  W. Davis of the Aldershot Constabulary was injured. On Saturday the reservists, 
  led by a private waving the red flag, ran wild in Union Street, Wellington Street, 
  Gordon Road and Victoria Road. Later the soldier with a red flag was seen perched 
  on top of a bus shouting 'Come on, the rebels'. Over 60 shops had their windows 
  smashed and were looted, including a jeweller's. The men stuffed their pockets 
  with diamonds, watches, etc., before hurling the clocks at local traders. The 
  police were overcome but military loyalists attacked the rioters with bayonets 
  and pick-axe handles. (65) <br>
  <br>
  In January 1920 the Chief of the Imperial General Staff warned the Cabinet that 
  the army's inability to aid the civilian power constituted 'grave cause for 
  anxiety'. He 'prohibited its employment except as a military force to be used 
  only in the last extremity'. (66) In March 1920 the War Office estimated that 
  only 25,000 (out of the 40,000 considered necessary for the maintenance of Home 
  Security) would be available. These limited forces contained a high proportion 
  of untrained soldiers with 'insufficient military discipline'. (67) <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <strong>THE PEACE COMES TO LUTON </strong><br>
  <br>
  How one interprets the mutinies of World War I depends on one's attitude to 
  social change. If one is looking for a centralised overall strategy, one will 
  only see a series of eruptions flaring up and dying out, some achieving their 
  objective, others ending in failure. A mutiny may be defeated, or fragmented 
  by demobilisation, but the participants live on, learn lessons and pass what 
  they have learned on to others. Mutinies can only be understood as part of a 
  wider movement of social upheaval, a movement which may include police as well 
  as army and industry. It is a mistake to draw strict distinctions between military 
  disturbances and other forms of social protest. A mutineer might cease to be 
  a mutineer on the day he ceases to be a member of the armed forces. But he does 
  not thereby cease to be a political animal nor will he forget the ties of comradeship 
  forged during his fight with the military authorities. <br>
  <br>
  During the summer of 1919 military unrest swept into civilian disturbances in 
  many regions. Employers and the authorities took advantage of the post-war depression 
  to try to impose the old bonds of discipline upon returning soldiers. Ex-servicemen 
  were equally determined not to accept pre-war conditions. A fierce conflict 
  took place during which the government and the employers never felt strong enough 
  for a show-down until, with the aid of the TUC General Council and an army purged 
  of its dissident elements, the ruling class was able to defeat the workers during 
  the General Strike of 1926. An adequate account of social upheaval between the 
  Armistice of 1918 and the defeat of the General Strike has yet to be written. 
  What follows is a short account of an incident in Luton, where comradeship in 
  arms was continued in a struggle against the civilian authorities. <br>
  <br>
  The Peace Treaty was signed in June 1919. Luton Town Council planned processions 
  with brass bands, floats, entertainment for the children and a fireworks display 
  followed by an evening of official gluttony described as a 'Mayor's banquet'. 
  The cost of the latter was to be paid from civic funds. Invitations were strictly 
  limited to the Mayor, councillors and close friends - none of whom had served 
  in the armed forces. In fact the officials had not even seen fit to include 
  any ex-servicemen in the preparations. As a result the Discharged Soldiers and 
  Sailors' Federation and the Comrades of the Great War Association withdrew from 
  the activities. They had planned alternative celebrations, but the Mayor and 
  his Council refused them the use of Wardown Park. <br>
  <br>
  On July 19, a rainy Saturday afternoon, a somewhat gloomy official procession 
  set off from Park Street recreation ground, along a route which passed the Federation's 
  headquarters, at the corner of Lea Road, where the ex-servicemen had prepared 
  their own contribution to the 'celebrations'. The Federation lined both sides 
  of the procession route with maimed and disabled ex-servicemen. Across the road 
  they hung a streamer saying: 'Don't pity us, give us work'. As the official 
  procession went past, it was joined by the angry ex-servicemen. Eventually they 
  arrived outside the Town Hall where they halted in heavy rain whilst the Mayor 
  read out the proclamation of peace. By now the Mayor was the most unpopular 
  man in town and his rating declined even further as thousands of old soldiers 
  booed and catcalled his patronising speech. Sensing the increasing hostility 
  one councillor called for three cheers for ex-servicemen. This only gave rise 
  to even greater howls of derision. By now the noise was deafening. Suddenly 
  the crowd surged forwards, causing the Mayor and his entourage to beat an undignified 
  retreat into the Town Hall. The crowd swiftly swept aside two constables. Willing 
  hands tore down the doors and the people entered just in time to see some of 
  the mayoral party disappearing through a rear entrance. Once inside, untold 
  damage was done. Decorations for the Grand Ball were torn down. The contents 
  of the Town Hall were hurled through the windows into the street. <br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile someone discovered that the Mayor and some supporters were barricaded 
  inside the Mayor's parlour. Serious harm to them was only prevented by the last 
  minute arrival of a contingent of police. The crowd inside the Town Hall engaged 
  them in pitched battle, the fighting soon spreading to those outside. Missiles 
  were hurled at the Town Clerk's office. <br>
  <br>
  Later that evening a crowd of 20,000 gathered in Popes Meadows for the advertised 
  fireworks display. But the rioting and looting at the Town Hall, which had taken 
  on a carnival atmosphere, turned out to be a more powerful attraction. At 10 
  pm the Mayor was still besieged in his parlour. Instead of the planned banquet 
  the mayoral party had spent seven hours huddled together in the dark behind 
  shattered windows. <br>
  <br>
  As the night wore on the riot gathered momentum. The Food Office in Manchester 
  Street was raided and several fires started. Attempts to put out the flames 
  were met with resistance and the Fire Brigade beat a hasty retreat. More bonfires 
  were lit outside and inside the Town Hall. In the confusion the Mayor was smuggled 
  out, disguised as a special constable. The nearby garage of Hart's Motors was 
  raided for petrol. When this was added to the fire the Town Hall quickly became 
  d blazing inferno. Attempts to put out the fire were thwarted by the cutting 
  of hosepipes. Remaining hoses had to be used to protect the police from the 
  crowd rather than to quench the flames. <br>
  <br>
  During the fierce fighting that followed the police found themselves heavily 
  outnumbered as soldiers, many in uniform, joined in against them. A chemist's 
  shop was raided and medicine bottles were used as missiles. A man was hit so 
  hard by a fireman's jet that he was hurled through a music shop window. The 
  crowd that went in to rescue him emerged with three pianos. These were dragged 
  into the roadway and used as accompaniments. The crowd sang 'Keep the Home Fires 
  Burning' before the biggest bonfire that Luton had ever seen. The burning down 
  of the Town Hall provided the perfect culmination to what had started as a very 
  wet day. <br>
  <br>
  Around midnight, supported by reinforcements from London, the police read the 
  riot act to the crowd, which by now numbered several thousands. Then, just as 
  the Town Hall clock struck one (before crashing to the ground amid a pile of 
  debris) the police began a savage assault, hitting out at men, women and children. 
  <br>
  <br>
  The following morning Luton looked like one of the ravaged cities of World War 
  I. Steel-helmeted troops stood guard amidst the burnt-out embers of buildings 
  and looted shops. The day passed with no signs of hostility between the troops 
  and the locals. But after closing time further outbreaks of rioting and looting 
  began. This continued for three or four nights until either police reinforcements 
  (or lack of further places to loot) brought the business to an end. <br>
  <br>
  Needless to say no more official banquets were planned in Luton for some time. 
  A subdued Council organised a banquet to end all banquets - for the aged and 
  children from the local workhouse. <br>
  <br>
  What became of the Mayor? Fearful of his life he cut short his political career 
  and left for Sutton-on-Sea. He only returned to Luton twice. Once for the funeral 
  of a friend and once more for his own. <br>
  <br>
  The 'restoration of law and order' led to several arrests. Because the authorities 
  were fearful of further repercussions the judge handed out surprisingly light 
  sentences. He even said there had been 'some provocation'. <br>
  <br>

  a recording made by Mr Ron Hall, reproduced by Bedfordshire County Library from 
  a copy in the possession of Dr D.H. Shaw.) <br>

  <br>
  <strong>CONCLUSIONS</strong> <br>
  <br>
  There is little doubt that during the years 1918-1920 Britain was near to a 
  social revolution, much nearer in fact than in the well publicised days of 1926. 
  The collapse of the General Strike ended the era during which the ruling classes 
  trembled. The mutinies we have described cannot be separated from the revolutionary 
  events that were sweeping across the industrialised world. There is no doubt 
  that they represent a significant chapter in working class history. <br>
  <br>
  The evidence presented shows that for a while the power of the armed forces 
  had slipped out of the control of the ruling classes. This raises fundamental 
  questions concerning the role of the 'working class leaders' of this period. 
  Apart from their resignation from the National Industrial Conference (in full 
  glare and publicity) the TUC leaders were very careful to avoid any course of 
  action that could have led to a common front between workers and members of 
  the armed forces. Leaders of the Triple Alliance were aware of the mood of the 
  country and of the state of the armed forces. Smillies' account of Lloyd George's 
  remarks to the leaders of the Triple Alliance is very revealing: 'The Army is 
  disaffected and cannot be relied upon. Trouble has already occurred in a number 
  of camps. If you ... strike, then you will defeat us'. (68) <br>
  <br>
  The trade union leaders were conscious of their role in this critical period. 
  This was clearly shown by T. E. Naylor, leader of the London Society of Compositors 
  and later a Labour MP. In 1922 he pleaded for the government to help the unemployed, 
  reminding them that in 1919 it was the 'responsible' trade unionists who had 
  prevented 'the revolution which would undoubtedly have broken out'. <br>
  <br>
  The trade union leaders never had any intention to defeat the government or 
  the employers. The major task of the organisers of labour was the same then 
  as it is today: to deliver a docile labour force, pacified by insignificant 
  pay increases, and to replace struggle centred on genuine grievances with rhetoric 
  about nationalisation and other red herrings. To grasp this point is to understand 
  why the Labour leaders of 1919 did not take advantage of the support which radical 
  policies could have had from the army. <br>
  <br>
  The possibility of successful revolution in Britain is only one of the many 
  questions raised by our account of the collapse of the British Army. Another 
  question is : 'to what extent did mutinies in both the Army and the Navy limit 
  the war of intervention against Russia?' A critique of the Russian Revolution 
  lies beyond the scope of this work. (69) Certain questions, however, have at 
  least to be asked. 'Just how serious was the threat to the Russian Revolution 
  from the hostile capitalist world?'. America was only marginally Involved. Britain, 
  as we have seen, was In no position to maintain any substantial force in Russia. 
  Neither were France or Germany. If the threat from the capitalist world was 
  relatively minor, how much credence can we give to the Leninist excuses for 
  repression, usually 'justified' by the existence of hostile foreign forces, 
  poised to intervene against the revolution? Or was it that the repressive policies 
  had their origins in the theory and practice of Bolshevism, as initiated by 
  Lenin and Trotsky? (70) <br>
  <br>
  If the Russian Revolution was 'allowed' to happen by virtue of the fact that 
  soldiers in the West were unwilling to suppress it - often for no stronger motive 
  than a sensible wish to go home - then questions are raised concerning the real 
  location of the Russian Revolution. For instance, were the victories of the 
  Red Army determined on the Russian battlefields or In the dockyards of Southampton, 
  Hamburg and Marseilles? How significant were the demands for instant demobilisation 
  by the Western Soldiers' and Sailors' Councils in determining the initial victories 
  of the Russian Revolution? <br>
  <br>
  Conversely to what extent was the containment of the European revolutionary 
  movements by the Social Democratic parties and by the trade unions the result 
  of the same social force responsible for the bureaucratic degeneration of the 
  Russian Revolution? Revolutions are not isolated events. They reflect social 
  pressures capable of transcending continents. So do mutinies - which are essential 
  ingredients of revolutionary change. For these reasons it is nonsense to speak 
  of the first working class revolution having taken place in Russia. Conversely, 
  when we speak of the bureaucratisation of the Russian Revolution it is even 
  more nonsensical to speak as if this were simply due to the special circumstances 
  of Russia. <br>
  <br>
  The foregoing account is not intended to provide a list of martyrs for this 
  or that cause. For us libertarians it matters little whether. In the long run, 
  the mutinies we have described benefited Russia, Dublin, Germany or what. There 
  is a limit to the consequences of an action beyond which the attribution of 
  causality becomes philosophical speculation. It would be a falsification of 
  history to say that most of these men had any clear picture of the society to 
  which their efforts were geared. No! What is significant in these mutinies is 
  the way men come together, in adverse and dangerous circumstances, in a spirit 
  of solidarity and self-sacrifice that has seldom been equalled. This is of real 
  significance to libertarians, seeking the spirit of freedom in history's darkest 
  hours. <br>
  <br>
  None of the struggles here described were inspired or directed by any vanguard 
  party. At the same time it is clear that there was a widespread sense of sympathy 
  with the Russian Revolution, bound up with the belief (however expressed) that 
  fundamental change could only be brought about by collective working class action. 
  <br>
  <br>
  Moreover, while there was no directing Central Committee or Revolutionary General 
  Staff (soldiers had had enough of these, already) conflicts in the armed forces 
  were not limited to sporadic, isolated outbursts. What comes across loud and 
  clear is that in spite of a legal situation in which it did not pay to advertise 
  them, the Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen's Councils forged many links both within 
  the armed forces and with workers in struggle. What happened in the armed forces 
  was simply part of a broad social movement, the full extent of which has yet 
  to be adequately assessed. This movement contained elements from the various 
  socialist groups. But they did not dominate it. While they were part of this 
  historic process few of the groups were really aware of the full extent and 
  consequences of the threat to authority in which they were involved. <br>
  <br>
  Many have seen (and still see) the relative absence of centralised and permanent 
  structures in the struggles here described as signifying a lack of revolutionary 
  consciousness amongst the people involved. In this the traditional left has 
  totally misread the situation. They fail to recognise the libertarian, revolutionary 
  face of the movement, seeing only its bureaucratic, institutionalised posterior. 
  They in fact <br>
  <br>
  contribute to its dimensions, spending most of their time seeking to build various 
  'revolutionary vanguard' parties. For us, this page is turned. We can now begin 
  to assess the mass autonomous movements of this century as an expression of 
  the fundamental drive by ordinary men and women to dominate their own lives, 
  to influence events, and to alter the course of history by themselves and for 
  themselves. <br>

  role. from the Battle of the Somme onwards. Crozier describes an incident in 
  July 1916 which typified official fear that battle fatigue was a threat to the 
  authority structure of the army; <br>
  <br>
  'I hear a rumour about riflemen retiring on the left and go out to "stop the 
  rot". A strong rabble of tired, hungry and thirsty stragglers approach me from 
  the east ... They are marched to the water reserve, given a drink, and hunted 
  back to fight. Another more formidable party cuts across to the south. They 
  mean business. They are damned if they are going to stay, it's all up. A young 
  sprinting subaltern heads them off. They push by him. He draws his revolver 
  and threatens them. They take no notice. He fires. Down drops a British soldier, 
  at his feet. The effect is instantaneous. They turn back.'(Ibid. , p. 109) <br>

  8. According to Pankhurst's The Workers' Dreadnought the figures were much higher. 
  The Dreadnought's figures were based on those compiled by a serving soldier, 
  H.V. Clark, from the records of Army Routine Orders and similar documents at 
  British Headquarters at Lille. They were : 1914 : 528; 1915 : 10,488; 1916 : 
  12,689; 1917 : 13,165; 1918 : 1,035. If correct, these figures reflect an inverse 
  relationship between the number of mutinies, which increased towards the end 
  of the war, and the number of convictions which declined towards the end of 
  the war. A visit from the police, however, produced a retraction from the Dreadnought 
  which stated that 3,076 had been sentenced to death but only 343 were executed.

  1917 to 1919, the authors say: 'These disturbances, though arising for a variety 
  of reasons and rarely linking with each other, went far towards compelling reform, 
  concessions and measures of improvement. They.led eventually to the dismantling 
  of large sections of the army.' (p. 88) <br>

  Corps alone. They worked on building, road-making, even in factories. There 
  was substantial syndicalist influence amongst them and they formed several unions. 
  Between 1916 and 1918 they were involved in at least 25 strikes. Since the men 
  were under military discipline these strikes in themselves constituted mutiny. 
  <br>
  <br>
  After the war, Labour Corps returnees had a profound effect in China itself. 
  In Shanghai there was a syndicalist group called the Chinese Wartime Labourers 
  Corps. In Canton, returnees created 26 new unions regarded as the 'first modern 
  unions in China'. (See Nohara Shiro, 'Anarchism and the May 4th Movement', Libero 
  International No. 3, November 1975). An interesting example of how ideas cross 
  frontiers. <br>

  purposive, but not externally directed by a political party or institution.

  28. Horatio Bottomley (1860-1933) was the founder and editor of the magazine 
  John Bull, and an Independent MP from 1918 to 1922. He was convicted of fraudulent 
  conversion in 1922 and died a pauper. A demagogue, he pocketed a fortune out 
  of war-time recruitment meetings, where it was said that the size of his peroration 
  was determined by the size of his 'take'. He 'took' 79.000. <br>

  45. According to Gill and Dallas : 'There was a sad sequel to this story: Private 
  John Pantling, whose arrest served as a spark to ignite, the mutiny, died on 
  February 13, 1919, aged 32, of pneumonia as a result of exposure whilst under 
  arrest. Apparently he had been placed in a damp cell, handcuffed with leg irons 
  to prevent any movement, and inadequately fed. A collection amongst his comrades 
  raised several hundred pounds, half of which was designated for his son's education. 
  Little is known of this remarkable man, who played so large a part in organising 
  the service troops at Calais Base, and whose last days were spent in negotiations 
  with a team of senior officers sent down from GHQ.' (op. cit. , p. Ill) <br>

  declared in the House of Commons, where it had been emphatically asserted on 
  numerous occasions, that only volunteers were being sent to Russia. <br>

  49. There have been many accounts of the mutinies in the German forces. For 
  an interesting account from a libertarian standpoint see <a href="http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Acropolis/8195/ikarint.htm">The 
  Wilhelmshaven Revolt</a> by Icarus. First published in 1944 (by Freedom Press)

  50. Lionel Yexley, euphemistically referred to as a 'naval correspondent' (see 
  Kendall, op. cit. , p. 191) was the editor of a lower deck journal called The 
  Fleet. Yexley had amassed a lot of information about underground naval organisations 
  and his statement that such organisations had existed for ten years was confirmed 
  in Bradley's Naval Annual of 1919. These incidents are also referred to by Geoffrey 
  Bennett in Cowan's War (London, Collins, 1964), p. 198. See also Kendall, op. 
  cit. , p. 190 <br>

  53a. On December 29, 1919, following a series of acts of militancy, a review 
  of the sentences of those convicted of naval mutiny was announced by the First 
  Lord of the Admiralty. Sentences of up to two years were halved. So were one 
  year sentences. The men serving such sentences had their medals restored. Even 
  the two sailors caught trying to sabot the fan engines of the 'Vindictive' had 
  their convictions reviewed after two years. <br>

  58a. The facts concerning the twelve civilians arrested are obscure. It is even 
  possible that these charges were dropped. What is significant is the fact that 
  many close links had been forged between Canadians and locals, who held the 
  former in high esteem. <br>

  1945 between four and five hundred Canadians stationed at Aldershot rioted and 
  smashed an amusement arcade and several shop windows, causing 25,000 worth 
  of damage. They were eventually quelled by a force of MP's from Portsmouth, 
  Reading, Oxford and Southampton. <br>
