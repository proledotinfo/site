<p class="title">&quot;ALIENATED LABOR&quot;</p>
<p class="author">
  From <em>Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts</em> (1844)<br>by Karl Marx</p>

<p>... We now have to grasp the essential connection between private property,
greed, the separation of labor, capital and landed property, exchange and
competition, value and the devaluation of man, monopoly, and competition,
etc. -- the connection between this entire system of estrangement&nbsp;
and the money system.
<p>&nbsp;We must avoid repeating the mistake of the political economist,
who bases his explanations on some imaginary primordial condition. Such
a primordial condition explains nothing. It simply pushes the question
into the grey and nebulous distance. It assumes as facts and events what
it is supposed to deduce -- namely, the necessary relationships between
two things, between, for example, the division of labor and exchange. Similarly,
theology explains the origin of evil by the fall of Man-- i.e., it assumes
as a fact in the form of history what it should explain.&nbsp;&nbsp; We
shall start out from a present-day economic fact. The worker becomes poorer
the more wealth he produces, the more his production increases in power
and extent. The worker becomes an ever cheaper commodity the more commodities
he produces. The devaluation of the human world grows in direct proportion
to the increase in value of the world of things. Labor not only produces
commodities; it also produces itself and the workers as a commodity and
it does so in the same proportion in which it produces commodities in general.
<p>&nbsp;This fact simply means that the object that labor produces, it
product, stands opposed to it as something alien, as a power independent
of the producer. The product of labor is labor embodied and made material
in an object, it is the objectification of labor. The realization of labor
is its objectification. In the sphere of political economy, this realization
of labor appears as a loss of reality for the worker, objectification as
loss of and bondage to the object, and appropriation as estrangement, as
alienation.
<p>&nbsp;So much does the realization of labor appear as loss of reality
that the worker loses his reality to the point of dying of starvation.
So much does objectification appear as loss of the object that the worker
is robbed of the objects he needs most not only for life but also for work.
Work itself becomes an object which he can only obtain through an enormous
effort and with spasmodic interruptions. So much does the appropriation
of the object appear as estrangement that the more objects the worker produces
the fewer can he possess and the more he falls under the domination of
his product, of capital.
<p>&nbsp;All these consequences are contained in this characteristic, that
the workers is related to the product of labor as to an alien object. For
it is clear that, according to this premise, the more the worker exerts
himself in his work, the more powerful the alien, objective world becomes
which he brings into being over against himself, the poorer he and his
inner world become, and the less they belong to him. It is the same in
religion. The more man puts into God, the less he retains within himself.
The worker places his life in the object; but now it no longer belongs
to him, but to the object. The greater his activity, therefore, the fewer
objects the worker possesses. What the product of his labor is, he is not.
Therefore, the greater this product, the less is he himself. The externalization
of the worker in his product means not only that his labor becomes an object,
an external existence, but that it exists outside him, independently of
him and alien to him, and beings to confront him as an autonomous power;
that the life which he has bestowed on the object confronts him as hostile
and alien.
<p>&nbsp;Let us now take a closer look at objectification, at the production
of the worker, and the estrangement, the loss of the object, of his product,
that this entails. The workers can create nothing without nature, without
the sensuous external world. It is the material in which his labor realizes
itself, in which it is active and from which, and by means of which, it
produces.
<p>&nbsp;But just as nature provides labor with the means of life, in the
sense of labor cannot live without objects on which to exercise itself,
so also it provides the means of life in the narrower sense, namely the
means of physical subsistence of the worker. The more the worker appropriates
the external world, sensuous nature, through his labor, the more he deprives
himself of the means of life in two respects: firstly, the sensuous external
world becomes less and less an object belonging to his labor, a means of
life of his labor; and, secondly, it becomes less and less a means of life
in the immediate sense, a means for the physical subsistence of the worker.
<p>&nbsp;In these two respects, then, the worker becomes a slave of his
object; firstly, in that he receives an object of labor, i.e., he receives
work, and, secondly, in that he receives means of subsistence. Firstly,
then, so that he can exists as a worker, and secondly as a physical subject.
The culmination of this slavery is that it is only as a worker that he
can maintain himself as a physical subject and only as a physical subject
that he is a worker. (The estrangement of the worker in his object is expressed
according to the laws of political economy in the following way: the more
the worker produces, the less he has to consume; the more value he creates,
the more worthless he becomes; the more his product is shaped, the more
misshapen the worker; the more civilized his object, the more barbarous
the worker; the more powerful the work, the more powerless the worker;
the more intelligent the work, the duller the worker and the more he becomes
a slave of nature.) Political economy conceals the estrangement in the
nature of labor by ignoring the direct relationship between the worker
(labor) and production. It is true that labor produces marvels for the
rich, but it produces privation for the worker. It produces palaces, but
hovels for the worker. It produces beauty, but deformity for the worker.
It replaces labor by machines, but it casts some of the workers back into
barbarous forms of labor and turns others into machines. It produces intelligence,
but it produces idiocy and cretinism for the worker. The direct relationship
of labor to its products is the relationship of the worker to the objects
of his production. The relationship of the rich man to the objects of production
and to production itself is only a consequence of this first relationship,
and confirms it. Later, we shall consider this second aspect.
<p>Therefore, when we ask what is the essential relationship of labor,
we are asking about the relationship of the worker to production. Up to
now, we have considered the estrangement, the alienation of the worker,
only from one aspect -- i.e., his relationship to the products of his labor.
But estrangement manifests itself not only in the result, but also in the
act of production, within the activity of production itself. How could
the product of the worker's activity confront him as something alien if
it were not for the fact that in the act of production he was estranging
himself from himself? After all, the product is simply the resume of the
activity, of the production. So if the product of labor is alienation,
production itself must be active alienation, the alienation of activity,
the activity of alienation. The estrangement of the object of labor merely
summarizes the estrangement, the alienation in the activity of labor itself.
<p>&nbsp;What constitutes the alienation of labor? Firstly, the fact that
labor is external to the worker -- i.e., does not belong to his essential
being; that he, therefore, does not confirm himself in his work,&nbsp;

but denies himself, feels miserable and not happy, does not develop free
mental and physical energy, but mortifies his flesh and ruins his mind.
Hence, the worker feels himself only when he is not working; when he is
working, he does not feel himself. He is at home when he is not working,
and not at home when he is working. His labor is, therefore, not voluntary
but forced, it is forced labor. It is, therefore, not the satisfaction
of a need but a mere means to satisfy needs outside itself. Its alien character
is clearly demonstrated by the fact that as soon as no physical or other
compulsion exists, it is shunned like the plague. External labor, labor
in which man alienates himself, is a labor of self-sacrifice, of mortification.
Finally, the external character of labor for the worker is demonstrated
by the fact that it belongs not to him but to another, and that in it he
belongs not to himself but to another.
<p>&nbsp;Just as in religion the spontaneous activity of the human imagination,
the human brain, and the human heart, detaches itself from the individual
and reappears as the alien activity of a god or of a devil, so the activity
of the worker is not his own spontaneous activity. It belongs to another,
it is a loss of his self.
<p>&nbsp;The result is that man (the worker) feels that he is acting freely
only in his animal functions -- eating, drinking, and procreating, or at
most in his dwelling and adornment -- while in his human functions, he
is nothing more than animal.&nbsp; It is true that eating, drinking, and
procreating, etc., are also genuine human functions. However, when abstracted
from other aspects of human activity, and turned into final and exclusive
ends, they are animal.
<p>&nbsp;We have considered the act of estrangement of practical human
activity, of labor, from two aspects: (1) the relationship of the worker
to the product of labor as an alien object that has power over him. The
relationship is, at the same time, the relationship to the sensuous external
world, to natural objects, as an alien world confronting him, in hostile
opposition. (2) The relationship of labor to the act of production within
labor. This relationship is the relationship of the worker to his own activity
as something which is alien and does not belong to him, activity as passivity,
power as impotence, procreation as emasculation, the worker's own physical
and mental energy, his personal life -- for what is life but activity?
-- as an activity directed against himself, which is independent of him
and does not belong to him. Self-estrangement, as compared with the estrangement
of the object mentioned above.
<p>&nbsp;We now have to derive a third feature of estranged labor from
the two we have already examined.
<p>&nbsp;Man is a species-being, not only because he practically and theoretically
makes the species -- both his own and those of other things -- his object,
but also -- and this is simply another way of saying the same thing --
because he looks upon himself as the present, living species, because he
looks upon himself as a universal and therefore free being.
<p>&nbsp;Species-life, both for man and for animals, consists physically
in the fact that man, like animals, lives from inorganic nature; and because
man is more universal than animals, so too is the area of inorganic nature
from which he lives more universal. Just as plants, animals, stones, air,
light, etc., theoretically form a part of human consciousness, partly as
objects of science and partly as objects of art -- his spiritual inorganic
nature, his spiritual means of life, which he must first prepare before
he can enjoy and digest them -- so, too, in practice they form a part of
human life and human activity. In a physical sense, man lives only from
these natural products, whether in the form of nourishment, heating, clothing,
shelter, etc. The universality of man manifests itself in practice in that
universality which makes the whole of nature his inorganic body, (1) as
a direct means of life and (2) as the matter, the object, and the tool
of his life activity. Nature is man's inorganic body --that is to say,
nature insofar as it is not the human body. Man lives from nature -- i.e.,
nature is his body -- and he must maintain a continuing dialogue with it
is he is not to die. To say that man's physical and mental life is linked
to nature simply means that nature is linked to itself, for man is a part
of nature.
<p>&nbsp;Estranged labor not only (1) estranges nature from man and (2)
estranges man from himself, from his own function, from his vital activity;
because of this, it also estranges man from his species. It turns his species-life
into a means for his individual life. Firstly, it estranges species-life
and individual life, and, secondly, it turns the latter, in its abstract
form, into the purpose of the former, also in its abstract and estranged
form.
<p>&nbsp;For in the first place labor, life activity, productive life itself,
appears to man only as a means for the satisfaction of a need, the need
to preserve physical existence. But productive life is species- life. It
is life-producing life. The whole character of a species, its species-character,
resides in the nature of its life activity, and free conscious activity
constitutes the species-character of man. Life appears only as a means
of life.
<p>&nbsp;The animal is immediately one with its life activity. It is not
distinct from that activity; it is that activity. Man makes his life activity
itself an object of his will and consciousness. He has conscious life activity.
It is not a determination with which he directly merges. Conscious life
activity directly distinguishes man from animal life activity. Only because
of that is he a species-being. Or, rather, he is a conscious being -- i.e.,
his own life is an object for him, only because he is a species-being.
Only because of that is his activity free activity. Estranged labor reverses
the relationship so that man, just because he is a conscious being, makes
his life activity, his being, a mere means for his existence.
<p>&nbsp;The practical creation of an objective world, the fashioning of
inorganic nature, is proof that man is a conscious species-being -- i.e.,
a being which treats the species as its own essential being or itself as
a species-being. It is true that animals also produce. They build nests
and dwelling, like the bee, the beaver, the ant, etc. But they produce
only their own immediate needs or those of their young; they produce only
when immediate physical need compels them to do so, while man produces
even when he is free from physical need and truly produces only in freedom
from such need; they produce only themselves, while man reproduces the
whole of nature; their products belong immediately to their physical bodies,
while man freely confronts his own product. Animals produce only according
to the standards and needs of the species to which they belong, while man
is capable of producing according to the standards of every species and
of applying to each object its inherent standard; hence, man also produces
in accordance with the laws of beauty.
<p>&nbsp;It is, therefore, in his fashioning of the objective that man
really proves himself to be a species-being. Such production is his active
species-life. Through it, nature appears as his work and his reality. The
object of labor is, therefore, the objectification of the species-life
of man: for man produces himself not only intellectually, in his consciousness,
but actively and actually, and he can therefore contemplate himself in
a world he himself has created. In tearing away the object of his production
from man, estranged labor therefore tears away from him his species-life,
his true species-objectivity, and transforms his advantage over animals
into the disadvantage that his inorganic body, nature, is taken from him.
<p>&nbsp;In the same way as estranged labor reduces spontaneous and free
activity to a means, it makes man's species-life a means of his physical
existence.
<p>&nbsp;Consciousness, which man has from his species, is transformed
through estrangement so that species-life becomes a means for him. (3)
Estranged labor, therefore, turns man's species-being -- both nature and
his intellectual species-power -- into a being alien to him and a means
of his individual existence. It estranges man from his own body, from nature
as it exists outside him, from his spiritual essence, his human existence.
(4) An immediate consequence of man's estrangement from the product of
his labor, his life activity, his species-being, is the estrangement of
man from man. When man confront himself, he also confronts other men. What
is true of man's relationship to his labor, to the product of his labor,
and to himself, is also true of his relationship to other men, and to the
labor and the object of the labor of other men.
<p>&nbsp;In general, the proposition that man is estranged from his species-being
means that each man is estranged from the others and that all are estranged
from man's essence. Man's estrangement, like all relationships of man to
himself, is realized and expressed only in man's relationship to other
men. In the relationship of estranged labor, each man therefore regards
the other in accordance with the standard and the situation in which he
as a worker finds himself.

<p>&nbsp;We started out from an economic fact, the estrangement of the
worker and of his production. We gave this fact conceptual form: estranged,
alienated labor. We have analyzed this concept, and in so doing merely
analyzed an economic fact.
<p>Let us now go on to see how the concept of estranged, alienated labor
must express and present itself in reality. If the product of labor is
alien to me, and confronts me as an alien power, to whom does it then belong?
To a being other than me. Who is this being? The gods? It is true that
in early times most production -- e.g., temple building, etc., in Egypt,
India, and Mexico -- was in the service of the gods, just as the product
belonged to the gods. But the gods alone were never the masters of labor.
The same is true of nature. And what a paradox it would be if the more
man subjugates nature through his labor and the more divine miracles are
made superfluous by the miracles of industry, the more he is forced to
forgo the joy or production and the enjoyment of the product out of deference
to these powers.
<p>&nbsp;The alien being to whom labor and the product of labor belong,
in whose service labor is performed, and for whose enjoyment the product
of labor is created, can be none other than man himself. If the product
of labor does not belong to the worker, and if it confronts him as an alien
power, this is only possible because it belongs to a man other than the
worker. If his activity is a torment for him, it must provide pleasure
and enjoyment for someone else. Not the gods, not nature, but only man
himself can be this alien power over men. Consider the above proposition
that the relationship of man to himself becomes objective and real for
him only through his relationship to other men. If, therefore, he regards
the product of his labor, his objectified labor, as an alien, hostile,
and powerful object which is independent of him, then his relationship
to that object is such that another man -- alien, hostile, powerful, and
independent of him -- is its master. If he relates to his own activity
as unfree activity, then he relates to it as activity in the service, under
the rule, coercion, and yoke of another man.
<p>&nbsp;Every self-estrangement of man from himself and nature is manifested
in the relationship he sets up between other men and himself and nature.
Thus, religious self-estrangement is necessarily manifested in the relationship
between layman and priest, or, since we are dealing here with the spiritual
world, between layman and mediator, etc. In the practical, real world,
self-estrangement can manifest itself only in the practical, real relationship
to other men. The medium through which estrangement progresses is itself
a practical one. So through estranged labor man not only produces his relationship
to the object and to the act of production as to alien and hostile powers;
he also produces the relationship in which other men stand to his production
and product, and the relationship in which he stands to these other men.
Just as he creates his own production as a loss of reality, a punishment,
and his own product as a loss, a product which does not belong to him,
so he creates the domination of the non-producer over production and its
product. Just as he estranges from himself his own activity, so he confers
upon the stranger and activity which does not belong to him.
<p>&nbsp;Up to now, we have considered the relationship only from the side
of the worker. Later on, we shall consider it from the side of the non-worker.
<p>&nbsp; Thus, through estranged, alienated labor, the worker creates
the relationship of another man, who is alien to labor and stands outside
it, to that labor. The relation of the worker to labor creates the relation
of the capitalist -- or whatever other word one chooses for the master
of labor -- to that labor.
<p>&nbsp;Private property is therefore the product, result, and necessary
consequence of alienated labor, of the external relation of the worker
to nature and to himself. Private property thus derives from an analysis
of the concept of alienated labor -- i.e., alienated man, estranged labor,
estranged life, estranged man. It is true that we took the concept of alienated
labor (alienated life) from political economy as a result of the movement
of private property. But it is clear from an analysis of this
<br>concept that, although private property appears as the basis and cause
of alienated labor, it is in fact its consequence, just as the gods were
originally not the cause but the effect of the confusion in men's minds.
Later, however, this relationship becomes reciprocal. It is only when the
development of private property reaches its ultimate point of culmination
that this, its secret, re-emerges; namely, that is (a) the product of alienated
labor, and (b) the means through which labor is alienated, the
<br>realization of this alienation.
