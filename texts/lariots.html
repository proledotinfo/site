<p class="title"> The Rebellion in Los Angeles:<br>The Context of a Proletarian Uprising</p>
<p class="author">from Aufheben #1 (1992)</p>
<p>On April 29th, Los Angeles exploded in the most serious urban uprising in America 
  this century. It took the federal army, the national guard and police from throughout 
  the country three days to restore order, by which time the residents of L.A. 
  had appropriated millions of dollars worth of goods and destroyed a billion 
  dollars of capitalist property. Most readers will be familiar with many of the 
  details of the rebellion. This article will attempt to make sense of the uprising 
  by putting the events into the context of the present state of class relations 
  in Los Angeles and America in order to see where this new militancy in the class 
  struggle may lead. </p>
<P>
Before the rebellion, there were two basic attitudes on the state of class
struggle in America. The pessimistic view is that the American working
class has been decisively defeated. This view has held that the U.S. is -
in terms of the topography of the global class struggle - little more than
a desert. The more optimistic view held, that despite the weakness of the
traditional working class against the massive cuts in wages, what we see in
the domination of the American left by single issue campaigns and
'Politically Correct' discourse is actually evidence of the vitality of the
autonomous struggles of sections of the working class. The explosion of
class struggle in L.A. shows the need to go beyond these one-sided views.
<P>
<P>
<B>1 Beyond the image</B>
<P>
As most of our information about the rioting has come through the
capitalist media, it is necessary to deal with the distorted perspective it
has given. Just as in the Gulf War, the media presented an appearance of
full immersion in what happened while actually constructing a falsified
view of the events. While in the Gulf there was a concrete effort to
disinform, in L.A. the distortion was a product not so much of censorship
as much as of the total incomprehension of the bourgeois media when faced
with proletarian insurrection. As Mike Davis points out, most reporters,
'merely lip-synched suburban cliches as they tramped through the ruins of
lives they had no desire to understand. A violent kaleidoscope of
bewildering complexity was flattened into a single, categorical scenario:
legitimate black anger over the King decision hijacked by hard-core street
criminals and it transformed into a maddened assault on their own
community.'<A href="#fn1">[1]</A> Such a picture is far from the truth.
<P>






The beating of Rodney King in 1991 was no isolated incident and, but for
the chance filming of the event, would have passed unnoticed into the
pattern of racist police repression of the inner cities that characterises
the present form of capitalist domination in America. But, because of the
insertion of this everyday event into general public awareness the incident
became emblematic. While the mainstream television audience forgot the
event through the interminable court proceedings, the eyes of the residents
of South Central L.A. and other inner cities remained fixed on a case that
had become a focus for their anger towards the system King's beating was
typical of. Across the country, but especially in L.A., there was the
feeling and preparation that, <B>whatever the result</B> of the trial, the
authorities were going to experience people's anger.[2] For the residents of
South Central, the King incident was just a trigger. They ignored his
televised appeals for an end to the uprising because it wasn't about him.
The rebellion was against the constant racism on the streets and about the
systematic oppression of the inner cities; it was against the everyday
reality of racist American capitalism.
<P>
One media set response to similar situations has been to label them as
'race riots'. Such a compartmentalisation broke down very quickly in L.A.
as indicated in <I>Newsweek</I>'s reports of the rebellion: 'Instead of
enraged young black men shouting "Kill Whitey," Hispanics and
even some whites - men, women and children - mingled with
African-Americans. The mob's primary lust appeared to be for property, not
blood. In a fiesta mood, looters grabbed for expensive consumer goods that
had suddenly become "free". Better-off black as well as white and
AsianAmerican business people all got burned.' <I>Newsweek</I> turned to an
'expert' - an urban sociologist - who tells them, 'This wasn't a race riot.
It was a class riot.'[3]
<P>
Perhaps uncomfortable with this analysis they turned to 'Richard
Cunningham, 19', 'a clerk with a neat goatee': "They don't care for
anything. Right now they're just on a spree. They want to live the
lifestyle they see people on TV living. They see people with big old
houses, nice cars, all the stereo equipment they want, and now that it's
free, they're gonna get it." As the sociologist told them - a class
riot.
<P>
In L.A., Hispanics, blacks and some whites united against the police; the
composition of the riot reflected the composition of the area. Of the first
5,000 arrests '52 per cent were poor Latinos, 10 per cent whites and only
38 per cent blacks.'[4] <P>
Faced with such facts, the media found it impossible to make the label
'race riot' stick. They were more successful, however, in presenting what
happened as random violence and as a senseless attack by people on their
own community. It is not that there was no pattern to the violence, it is
that the media did not like the pattern it took. Common targets were
journalists and photographers, including black and Hispanic ones. Why
should the rioters target the media? - 1) these scavangers gathering round
the story offer a real danger of identifying participants by their photos
and reports. 2) The uncomprehending deluge of coverage of the rebellion
follows years of total neglect of the people of South Central except their
representation as criminals and drug addicts. In South Central, reporters
are now being called "image looters". <P>
But the three <B>fundamental</B> aspects to the rebellion were the refusal
of representation, direct appropriation of wealth and attacks on property;
the participants went about all three thoroughly.
<P>
<B>Refusal of representation</B>
<P>
While the rebellion in '65 had been limited to the Watts district, in '92
the rioters circulated their struggle very effectively. Their first task
was to bypass their 'representatives'. The black leadership - from local
government politicians through church organisations and civil rights
bureaucracy - failed in its task of controlling its community. Elsewhere in
the States this strata did to a large extent succeed in channelling
people's anger away from the direct action of L.A., managing to stop the
spread of the rebellion. The struggle was circulated, but we can only
imagine the crisis that would have ensued if the actions in other cities
had reached L.A.'s intensity. Still, in L.A. both the self-appointed and
elected representatives were by-passed. They cannot deliver. The rioters
showed the same disrespect for their 'leaders' as did their Watts
counterparts. Years of advancement by a section of blacks, their
intersection of themselves as mediators between 'their' community and US
capital and state, was shown as irrelevant. While community leaders triedto
restrain the residents, 'gang leaders brandishing pipes, sticks and
baseball bats whipped up hotheads, urging them not to trash their own
neighbourhoods but to attack the richer turf to the west'.[5]

<B>Attacks on property</B>
<P>
The insurgents used portable phones to monitor the police. The freeways
that have done so much to divide the communities of L.A. were used by the
insurgents to spread their struggle. Cars of blacks and Hispanics moved
throughout a large part of the city burning their targets - commercial
premises, the sites of capitalist exploitation - while at other points
traffic jams formed outside Malls as their contents were liberated. As well
as being the first multiethnic riot in American history, it was its first
car-borne riot. The police were totally overwhelmed by the creativity and
ingenuity of the rioters.
<P>
<B>Direct appropriation</B>
<P>
"Looting, which instantly destroys the commodity as such, also
discloses what
the commodity ultimatly implies: The
army, the police and the other
specialized detachments of the state's
monopoly of armed violence."[6] Once the rioters had got the police off the
streets looting was clearly an
overwhelming aspect of the
insurrection. The rebellion in Los
Angeles was an explosion of anger
against capitalism but also an eruption
of what could take its place:
creativity, initiative, joy.

"Looters of all races owned the streets, storefronts and malls. Blond
kids loaded their Volkswagon with stereo gear... Filipinos in a banged up
old clunker stocked up on baseball mitts and sneakers. Hispanic mothers
with children browsed the gaping chain drug marts and clothing stores. A
few Asians were spotted as well. Where the looting at Watts had been
desperate, angry, mean, the mood this time was closer to a maniac
fiesta".[7] <P>
The direct appropriation of wealth (pejorativly labelled looting) breaks
the circuit of capital - Work Wage-Consumption - and such a struggle is
just as unacceptable to capital as a strike. However it is also true that,
for a large section of the L.A. working class, rebellion at the level of
production is impossible. From the constant awareness of a 'good life' out
of reach - commodities they cannot have - to the contradiction of the
simplest commodity, the use-values they need are all stamped with a price
tag; they experience the contradictions of capital not at the level of
alienated production but at the level of alienated consumption, not at the
level of labour but at the level of the commodity.

It is important to grasp the importance of direct appropriation, especially
for subjects such as those in L.A. who are relatively marginalised from
production. This 'involves an ability to understand working-class behaviour
as tending to bring about, in opposition to the law of value, a direct
relationship with the social wealth that is produced. Capitalist
development itself, having reached this level of class struggle, destroys
the 'objective' parameters of social exchange. The proletariat can thus
only recompose itself, within this level, through a material will to
reappropriate to itself in <I>real</I> terms the relation to social wealth
that capital has <I>formally</I> redimensioned'.[8] <P>
If the bourgeois press had to concede the class nature of the uprising, all
the stranger that a part of the left here felt it necessary to insist that
what happened was a race riot. <I>Living Marxism</I> felt it necessary to
reduce this eruption of class anger to their narrow conception of the
'silent race war'. The fact that the multiracial rebellion by the
proletariat of L.A. was a massive explosion of class struggle escaped the
notice of the RCP; but then for followers of <I>Living </I>(Dying?)
<I>Marxism </I>class struggle has no existence; certainly it is not
something that can be allowed to get in the way of 'the battle of ideas'.
The RCP's whole stance on this and other acts of class struggle (such as
the poll tax rebellion) is evidence of their retreat to the realm of
ideology.
<P>
The SWP's response was more traditional. While they at least recognised the
class nature of the events they did not bother to analyse the events
themselves, just used them as illustrations of how their line on race and
class was correct. Alex Callinicos, for example, subordinated his attempt
at a serious analysis of the relation between 'Race and Class' to the more
urgent task of giving a rather lame defence of their ANL strategy which is
obviously in deep crisis.[9]
<P>
The RCP and SWP: mirrors of each other. What we saw in both cases was not a
response to the riots - not an attempt to learn from the actions of the
class - rather just the taking of them as an excuse to trot out the
previously developed line. So for the RCP the uprising was a 'race riot'
showing the correctness of their idea of a 'silent race war' while for the
SWP it shows the validity of their ANL strategy. For both groups the
significance of any outburst of class struggle is always just to show the
problems of capitalism and the need for the(ir) party. The point with these
and other Trotskyite groupings is that they already know what revolution is
and what forms of organisation and actions it involves - it was what
happened in Russia in 1917. They can only see the L.A. rebellion as
evidence that their diagnosis of capitalism's sickness and their cure
remain valid.
<P>
But we on the non-Leninist revolutionary left should be wary of just
repeating our line that the riots were just great and that we support them
whole-heartedly. It is not enough just to support the events, we should try
to understand them and the development they represent.
<P>
<B>2 Race and class composition</B>
<P>
So even <I>Newsweek</I>, voice of the American bourgeoisie, conceded that
what happened was not a 'race riot' but a 'class riot'. But in identifying
the events as a class rebellion we do not have to deny they had 'racial'
elements. The overwhelming importance of the riots was the extent to which
the racial divisions in the American working class were transcended in the
act of rebellion; but it would be ludicrous to say that race was absent as
an issue. There were 'racial' incidents: what we need to do is see how
these elements are an expression of the underlying class conflict. Some of
the crowd who initiated the rebellion at the Normandie and Florence
intersection went on to attack a white truck driver, Reginald Oliver Denny.
The media latched on to the beating, transmitting it live to confirm
suburban white fear of urban blacks. But how representative was this
incident? An analysis of the deaths during the uprising shows it was not.[10]
Still, we need to see how the class war is articulated in 'racial' ways.
<P>
In America generally, the ruling class has always promoted and manipulated
racism, from the genocide of native Americans, through slavery, to the
continuing use of ethnicity to divide the labour force. The black working
class experience is to a large extent that of being pushed out of
occupations by succeeding waves of immigrants. While most groups in
American society on arrival at the bottom of the labour market gradually
move up, blacks have constantly been leapfrogged. Moreover, the racism this
involves has been a dampner on the development of class consciousness on
the part of white workers.
<P>
In L.A. specifically, the inhabitants of South Central constitute some of
the most excluded sectors of the working class. Capital's strategy with
regards these sectors is one of repression carried out by the police - a
class issue. However the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) is
predominantly white andits victims massively black and Hispanic (or as
P.C. discourse would have it, people of colour). Unlike in other cities,
where the racist nature of the split between the included and excluded
sectors is blurred by the state's success in co-opting large numbers of
blacks on to the police force, in L.A. capital's racist strategy of
division and containment is revealed in every encounter between the LAPD
and the population - a race issue.
<P>
When the blacks and Hispanics of L.A. have been marginalised and oppressed
according to their skin colour, it is not surprising that in their
explosion of class anger against their oppressors they will use skin colour
as a racial shorthand in identifying the enemy, just as it has been used
against them. So even if the uprising had been a 'race riot', it would
still have been a <B>class </B>riot. It is also important to recognise the
extent to which the participants went beyond racial stereotypes. While the
attacks on the police, the acts of appropriation and attacks on property
were seen as proper and necessary by nearly everyone involved, there is
evidence that acts of violence against individuals on the basis of their
skin colour were neither typical of the rebellion nor widely supported.[11] In
the context of the racist nature of L.A. class oppression, it would have
been surprising if there had not been a racial element to some of the
rebellion. What is surprising and gratifying is the overwhelming extent to
which this was not the case, the extent to which the insurgents by-passed
capital's racist strategies of control.

One form the rebellion took was a systematic assault on Korean businesses.
The Koreans are on the front-line of the confrontation between capital and
the residents of central L.A. - they are the face of capital for these
communities. Relations between the black community and the Koreans had
collapsed following the Harlins incident and its judicial result. In an
argument over a $1.79 bottle of orange juice, Latasha Harlins, a 15-year
old black girl, was shot in the back of the head by a Korean grocer - Soon
Ja Du - who was then let off with a $500 fine and some community service.
While the American State packs its Gulags with poor blacks for just trying
to survive, it allows a shopkeeper to kill their children. But though this
event had a strong effect on the blacks of South Central, their attack on
Korean property cannot be reduced to vengeance for one incident - it was
directed against the whole system of exchange. The uprising attacked
capital in its form of property, not any property but the property of
businesses - the institutions of exploitation; and in the black and
Hispanic areas, most of these properties and businesses were owned by
Koreans. But though we should understand the resentment towards the Koreans
as class-based, it is necessary to put this in the context of the overall
situation. In L.A., the black working-class's position deteriorated in the
late 1970s with the closure of the heavy industry, whereas at the end the
sixties they had started to be employed in large numbers. This was part of
the internationalization of L.A.'s economy, its insertion into the Pacific
Rim centre of accumulation which also involved an influx of mainly Japanese
capital into downtown redevelopment, immigration of over a million Latin
Americans to take the new low-wage manufacturing jobs that replaced the
jobs blacks had been employed in, and the influx of South Koreans into
L.A.'s mercantile economy. Thus while Latinos offered competition for jobs,
the Koreans came to represent capital to blacks. However, these racial
divisions are totally contingent. Within the overall restructuring, the
jobs removed from L.A. blacks were relocated to other parts of the Pacific
Rim such as South Korea. The combativity of these South Korean workers
shows that the petty-bourgeois role Koreans take in L.A. is but part of a
wider picture in which class conflict crosses all national and ethnic
divides as global finance capital dances around trying to escape its
nemesis but always recreating it.
<P>
<B>3 Class composition and capitalist restructuring </B> <P>
The American working class is divided between waged and unwaged, blue and
white collar, immigrant and citizen labour, guaranteed and unguaranteed;
but as well as this, and often synonymous with these distinctions, it is
divided along ethnic lines. Moreover, these divisions are real divisions in
terms of power and expectations. We cannot just cover them up with a call
for class unity or fatalistically believe that, until the class is united
behind a Leninist party or other such vanguard, it will not be able to take
on capital. <I>In terms of the American situation as well as with other
areas of the global class conflict it is necessary to use the dynamic
notion of <B>class composition</B>[12] rather than a static notion of social
classes.</I>

The rebellion in South Central Los Angeles and the associated actions
across the United States showed the presence of an antagonistic proletarian
subject within American capitalism. This presence had been occluded by a
double process: on the one hand, a sizeable section of American workers
have had their consciousness of being proletarian - of being in antagonism
to capital - obscured in a widespread identification with the idea of being
'middle-class'[13]; and on the other, for a sizeable minority, perhaps a
quarter of the population, there has being their recomposition as
marginalised sub-workers excluded from consideration as a part of society
by the label 'underclass'.[14] The material basis for such sociological
categorisations is that, on the one hand there is the increased access to
'luxury' consumption for certain 'higher' strata, while on the other there
is the exclusion from anything but 'subsistence' consumption by those
'lower' strata consigned to unemployment or badly paid part-time or
irregular work.[15] <P>
This strategy of capital's carries risks, for while the included sector is
generally kept in line by the brute force of economic relations, redoubled
by the fear of falling into the excluded sector, the excluded themselves,
for whom the American dream has been revealed as a nightmare, must be kept
down by sheer police repression. In this repression, the war on drugs has
acted as a cover for measures that increasingly contradict the 'civil
rights' which bourgeois society, especially in America, has prided itself
on bringing into the world.
<P>
Part of the U.S. capital's response to the Watts and other 'sixties
rebellions was to give ground. To a large section of the working class
revolting because its needs were not being met, capital responded with
money - the form of mediation <I>par excellence </I>- trying to meet some
of that pressure within the limits of capitalist control.[16] This was not
maintained into the 'eighties. For example, federal aid to cities fell from
$47.2 billion in 1980 to $21.7 billion in 1992. The pattern is that of the
global response to the proletarian offensives of the 'sixties and
'seventies: first give way - allowing wage increases, increasing welfare
spending (i.e. meeting the social needs of the proletariat) - then, when
capital has consolidated its forces, the second part - restructure
accumulation on a different basis - destructure knots of working class
militancy, create unemployment.
<P>
In America, this strategy was on the surface more successful than in
Europe. The American bourgeoisie had managed to halt the general rise in
wages by selectively allowing some sectors of the working class to maintain
or increase their living standards while others had theirs massively
reduced. One sector in particular has felt the brunt of this strategy: the
residents of the inner city who are largely black and Hispanic. The average
yearly income of black high school graduates fell by 44% between 1973 and
1990, there have been severe cutbacks in social programmes and massive
disinvestment. With the uprising, the American working class has shown that
capital's success in isolating and screwing this section has been
temporary. <P>
The re-emergence of an active proletarian subject shows the importance,
when considering the strategie of capital, of not forgetting that its
restructuring is a <I>response</I> to working class power. The working
class is not just an object within capital's process. It is a <I>subject
</I>(or plurality of subjects), and, at the level of political class
composition reached by the proletariat in the 'sixties, it undermined the
process. Capital's restructuring was an attack on this class composition,
an attempt to transform the subject back into an object, into labour-power.[17]
<P>
Capitalist restructuring tried to introduce fragmentation and hierarchy
into a class subject which was tending towards unity (a unity that
respected multilaterality). It moved production to other parts of the world
(only as in Korea to export class struggle as well); it tried to break the
strength of the 'mass worker' by breaking up the labour force within
factories into teams and by spreading the factory to lots of small
enterprises; it has also turned many wage-labourers into selfemployed to
make people internalise capital's dictates. In America, the fragmentation
also occurred along the lines of ethnicity. Black blue-collar workers have
been a driving force in working class militancy as recorded by C.L.R. James
and others. For a large number of blacks and others, the new plan involved
their relegation to Third World poverty levels.[18] But as Negri puts it,
"marginalisation is as far as capital can go in excluding people from
the circuits of production - expulsion is impossible. Isolation within the
circuit of production - this is the most that capital's action of
restructuration can hope to achieve."[19] When recognising the power of
capital's restructuring it is necessary to affirm the fundamental place of
working class struggles as the motor force of capital's development.
Capital attacks a certain level of political class composition and a new
level is recomposed; but this is not the creation of the perfect, pliable
working class - it is only ever a <I>provisional recomposition</I> of the
class on the basis of its previously attained level. <P>
Capitalist restructuring has taken the form in Los Angeles of its insertion
into the Pacific Rim pole of accumulation. Metal banging and transport
industry jobs, which blacks only started moving into in the tail end of the
boom in late 'sixties and the early 'seventies, have left the city, while
about one million Latino immigrants have arrived, taking jobs in low-wage
manufacturing and labour-intensive services. The effect on the Los Angeles
black community has not been homogeneous; while a sizeable section has
attained guaranteed status through white-collar jobs in the public sector,
the majority who were employed in the private sector in traditional working
class jobs have become unemployed. It is working class youth who have fared
worse, with unemployment rates of 45% in South Central.
<P>
But the recomposition of the L.A. working class has not been entirely a
victory of capitalist restructuring. Capital would like this section of
society to work. It would like its progressive undermining of the welfare
system to make the 'underclass' go and search for jobs, any jobs anywhere.
Instead, many residents survive by 'Aid to Families With Dependent
Children', forcing the cost of reproducing labour power[20] on to the state,
which is particularly irksome when the labour power produced is so unruly.
The present consensus among bourgeois commentators is that the problem is
the 'decline of the family and its values.' Capital's imperative is to
re-impose its model of the family as a model of work discipline and form of
reproduction (make the proles take on the cost of reproduction themselves).[21]
<P>
<B>4 A note on architecture and the postmodernists</B> <P>
Los Angeles as we know is the 'city of the future'. In the 'thirties the
progressive vision of business interests prevailed and the L.A. streetcars
- one of the best public transport systeems in America - were ripped up;
freeways followed. It was in Los Angeles that Adorno & Horkheimer first
painted their melancholy picture of consciousness subsumed by capitalism
and where Marcuse later pronounced man 'One Dimensional'. More recently,
Los Angeles has been the inspiration for fashionable post-theory.
Baudrillard, Derrida and other postmodernist post-structuralist scum have
all visited and performed in the city. Baudrillard even found here 'utopia
achieved'.[22]
<P>
The 'postmodern' celebrators of capitalism love the architecture of Los
Angeles, its endless freeways and the redeveloped downtown. They write
eulogies to the sublime space within the $200 a night Bonaventura hotel,
but miss the destruction of public space outside. The postmodernists,
though happy to extend a term from architecture to the whole of society,
and even the epoch, are reluctant to extend their analysis of the
architecture just an inch beneath the surface. The 'postmodern' buildings
of Los Angeles have been built with an influx of mainly Japanese capital
into the city. Downtown L.A. is now second only to Tokyo as a financial
centre for the Pacific Rim. But the redevelopment has been at the expense
of the residents of the inner city. Tom Bradley, an ex-cop and Mayor since
1975, has been a perfect black figurehead for capital's restructuring of
L.A.. He has supported the massive redevelopment of downtown L.A., which
has been exclusively for the benefit of business. In 1987, at the request
of the Central City East Association of Businesses he ordered the
destruction of the makeshift pavement camps of the homeless; there are an
estimated 50,000 homeless in L.A., 10, 000 of them children. Elsewhere city
planning has involved the destruction of people's homes and of working
class work opportunities to make way for business development funded by
Pacific Rim capital - a siege by international capital of working class Los
Angeles.
<P>
But the postmodernists did not even
have to look at this behind-the-scenes
movement, for the violent nature of the
development is apparent from a look at
the constructions themselves. The
architecture of Los Angeles is
characterised by militarisation. City
planning in Los Angeles is essentially
a matter for the police. An
overwhelming feature of the L.A.
environment is the presence of security
barriers, surveillance technology - the
policing of space. Buildings in public
use like the inner city malls and a
public library are built like
fortresses, surrounded by giant
security walls and dotted with
surveillance cameras.


<P>
In Los Angeles, "on the bad edge of postmodernity, one observes an
unprecedented tendency to merge urban design, architecture and the police
apparatus in a single comprehensive security effort."(23) Just as Haussman
redesigned Paris after the revolutions of 1848, building boulevards to give
clear lines of fire, L.A. architects and city planners have remade L.A.
since the Watts rebellion. Public space is closed, the attempt is made to
kill the street as a means of killing the crowd. Such a strategy is not
unique to Los Angeles but here it has reached absurd levels: the police are
so desperate to 'kill the crowd' that they have taken the unprecedented
step of killing the toilet.[24] Around office developments 'public' art
buildings and landscaped garden 'microparks' are designed into the parking
structures to allow office workers to move from car to office or shop
without being exposed to the dangers of the street. The public spaces that
remain are militarised, from 'bumproof' bus shelter benches to automatic
sprinklers in the parks to stop people sleeping there. White middle class
areas are surrounded by walls and private security. During the riots,the
residents of these enclaves either fled or armed themselves and nervously
waited.
<P>
We see, then, that in the States, but especially in L.A., architecture is
not merely a question of aesthetics, it is used along with the police to
separate the included and the excluded sections of capitalist society. But
this phenomenon is by no means unique to America. Across the advanced
capitalist countries we see attempts to redevelop away urban areas that
have been sites of contestation. In Paris, for example, we have seen, under
the flag of 'culture', the Pompidou centre built on a old working class
area, as a celebration of the defeat of the '68 movement.[25] Here in Britain
the whole of Docklands was taken over by a private development corporation
to redevelop the area - for a while yuppie flats sprang up at ridiculous
prices and the long-standing residents felt besieged in their estates by
armies of private security guards. Still, we saw how that ended... Now in
Germany, the urban areas previously marginalised by the Wall, such as
Kreuzberg and the Potzdamer Platz, have become battlegrounds over who's
needs the new Berlin will satisfy.
<P>
Of course, such observations and criticisms of the 'bad edge of
postmodernity', if they fail to see the antagonism to the process and
allowed themselves to be captivated by capital's dialectic, by its creation
of our dystopia, could fall into mirroring the postmodernists' celebration
of it. There is no need for pessimism - what the rebellion showed was that
capital has not killed the crowd. Space is still contested. Just as
Haussman's plans did not stop the Paris Commune, L.A. redevelopment did not
stop the 1992 rebellion.

<P>
We cannot deny the role gangs played in the uprising.[26] The systematic nature
of the rioting is directly linked to their participation and most
importantly to the truce on internal fighting they called <B>before</B> the
uprising. Gang members often took the lead which the rest of the
proletariat followed.[27] The militancy of the gangs - their hatred of the
police - flows from the unprecedented repression the youth of South Central
have experienced: a level of state repression on a par with that dished out
to rebellious natives by colonial forces such as that suffered by
Palestinians in the Occupied Territories. Under the guise of gang-busting
and dealing with the 'crack menace', the LAPD have launched massive 'swamp'
operations; they have formed files on much of the youth of South Central
and murdered lots of proletarians. <P>
As Mike Davis put it in 1988, "the contemporary Gang scare has become
an imaginary class relationship, a terrain of pseudoknowledge and fantasy
projection, a talisman."[28] The 'gang threat' has been used as an excuse
to criminalise the youth of South Central L.A.[29] We should not deny the
existence of the problems of crack use and inter-gang violence, but we need
to see that, what has actually been a massive case of working class on
working class violence, a sorry example of internalised aggression
resulting from a position of frustrated needs, has been interpreted as a
'lawless threat' to justify more of the repression and oppression that
created the situation in the first place. To understand recent gang warfare
and the role of gangs in the rebellion we must look at the history of the
gang phenomenon.
<P>
In Los Angeles, black street gangs emerged in the late 1940s primarily as a
response to white racist attacks in schools and on the streets. When Nation
of Islam and other black nationalist groups formed in the late 'fifties,
Chief Parker of the LAPD conflated the two phenomena as a combined black
menace. It was a self-fulfilling prophecy, for the repression launched
against the gangs and black militants had the effect of radicalising the
gangs. This politicisation reached a peak in the Watts rebellion, when, as
in '92, gang members made a truce and were instrumental in the black
working class success in holding off the police for four days. The truce
formed in the heat of the rebellion lasted for most of the rest of the
'sixties. Many gang members joined the Black Panther Party or formed other
radical political groupings. There was a general feeling that the gangs had
'joined the Revolution'. <P>
The repression of the movement involved the FBI's COINTELPRO[30] programme and
the LAPD's own red squad. The Panthers were shot on the streets and on the
campuses both directly by the police and by their agents, their
headquarters in L.A. were besieged by LAPD SWAT teams, and dissension was
sown in their ranks. Although the Panthers' politics were flawed, they were
an organic expression of the black proletariat's experience of American
capitalism. The systematic nature of their repression shows just how
dangerous they were perceived to be. <P>
As even the L.A. times admitted,[31] the
recrudescence of gangs in L.A. in the
early 'seventies was a direct
consequence of the decimation of the
more political expressions of black
frustration. A new aspect of this
phenomena was the prodigious spread of
Crip sets which caused the other gangs
to federate as the Bloods. As Davis
puts it, "this was not merely a
gang revival, but a radical
permutation of black gang culture. The
Crips, however perversely, inherited
the Panther aura of fearlessness and
transmitted the ideology of armed
vanguardism (shorn of its program). But
too often Crippin' came to represent an
escalation of intra-ghetto violence to
Clockwork Orange levels (murder as a
status symbol, and so on)...[the Crips]
achieved a 'managerial revolution' in
gang organisation. If they began as a
teenage substitute for the fallen
Panthers, they evolved through the
1970s into a hybrid of teen cult and
proto-mafia".[32]
<P>

<P>
That gangs, even in their murderous mutation as 'proto-mafia' Crips and
Bloods, have been an expression of the need for political organisation is
indicated in a few instances where they have made political interventions.
In two major situations, the Monravia riots in 1972 and the L.A. schools
busing crisis of 1977-79, the Crips intervened in support of the black
community. These gangs, as an expression of the proletariat, are not in the
grips of a false consciousness that makes them think all there is to life
is gold chains and violence. Whenever they have been given a chance to
speak, for instance in December 1972 at the beginning of the transformation
of the gangs into the ultra-violent Crips and Bloods, they have come out
with clear political demands.[33] Every time they have been given a chance to
express themselves, similar demands have been voiced. The LAPD does all in
its power to stop the gangs being given a voice so as to maintain its war
against them. <P>
Still, if the gangs wanted to appeal to people's sympathies, they have done
themselves no favours by dealing in crack. However, if we look closely at
this we find that the mass move into this trade is pushed on them by
capital. Young blacks moved into the alternative economy of drugs when
traditional occupations were destroyed. We are dealing with material
pressures. <P>
For a member of South Central's youth proletariat, the only rational
economic choice is to sell drugs. While the internationalization of the Los
Angeles economy has meant a loss for working class blacks, what the Crips
and Bloods have managed to do is insert themselves back into the circuit of
international trade. While the international trade in legal commodities
decided that the Los Angeles blacks were expendable another branch found
them eminently useful. Southern California has taken over from Florida as
the main route of entry of cocaine into the United States. When in the
early 'eighties the cocaine business found the market for its product
saturated, its price falling and profits threatened, it, like any other
multinational, diversified and developed new products, the chief one being
crack - 'the poor man's cocaine'. Young proletarians participate in this
business because it is the work on offer. It is not them but capital that
reduces life to survival/work. We can see, then, that selling crack is in a
sense just another undesirable activity like making weapons or cigarettes
that proletarians are forced to engage in.[34] But there is a significant
difference. Within most occupations proletarians can organise directly
within and against capital; but the drug dealing gangs do not confront
capital as labour. Gangs do not confront the capital of the enterprise,
they confront the repressive arm of capital-in-general: the State. In fact,
to the extent that the gangs engage in the cocaine trade and fit firmly
into the circuit of international capital, <B>they are the capitalist
enterprise</B>. This is a problem. The drive-by shootings and lethal turf
wars of the black gangs is the proletariat killing itself for capital.
<P>
It is necessary to see, then, that the murderous gangbanging[35] phenomenon
which is presently halted has not been, as the bourgeois press would have
it, the result of the breakdown of 'family values' and the loss of the
restraining influence of the middle class as they left for the suburbs;
rather it resulted from: 1) the economics of capitalist restructuring (the
replacing of traditional industries with drugs) and 2) the active
destruction of political forms of self-organisation by state repression.
The solution to the problem of the murderous crack wars is the rediscovery
of political self-activity of the sort shown in the rebellion. The solution
to inter-proletarian violence is proletarian violence. <P>
The irrepressible nature of the gang-phenomenon shows the pressing <B>need
</B>for organisation on the part of the youth proletariat of L.A. For a
while in the 'sixties it took a self-consciously political form. When this
manifestly political form of organisation was repressed, the gangs came
back with a vengeance, showing that they express a real and pressing
<B>need</B>. What we have seen in and since the uprising is a new
politicisation of gang culture: <B>a return of the repressed. </B>
<P>
<B>8 Political ideas of the gangs</B>
<P>
Since the rebellion, some attention has been given to the political ideas
and proposals of the gangs (or, more precisely, the gang leadership). The
proposals are mixed. Some are unobjectionable, like that for gang members
with video cameras to follow the police to prevent brutality and for money
for locally community controlled rebuilding of the neighbourhood; but
others, like replacing welfare with workfare, and for close cooperation
between the gangs and corporations, are more dubious. The political ideas
from which these proposals spring seem largely to be limited to black
nationalism. So how should we understand these proposals and this ideology?
<P>
The attempt by the gang leadership to interpose themselves as mediators of
the ghetto has similarities to the role of unions and we should perhaps
apply to them a similar critique to that which we apply to unions. It is
necessary: 1) to recognise a difference between the leaders and the
ordinary members 2) to recognise the role of the leadership as recuperating
and channelling the demands of the rank and file.
<P>
Some of the gang leaders' conceptions are, quite apart from being
reactionary, manifestly unrealistic. In the context of capitalist
restructuring, the inner city ghetto and its 'underclass' is surplus to
requirements - it has been written off - it has no place in capitalist
strategy, except perhaps as a terror to encourage the others. It is
extremely unlikely that there will be a renegotiation of the social
contract to bring these subjects back into the main rhythm of capitalist
development. This was to an extent possible in the 'sixties and 'seventies,
but no longer. <P>
Understandably, in the light of the main options available, there is a
desire in the inhabitants of L.A. for secure unionized employment.[36] But
capital has moved many industries away and they will not come back. Many of
the people in these areas recognise the change and want jobs in computers
and other areas of the new industries. But, although individual people from
the ghetto may manage to get a job in these sectors (probably only by
moving), for the vast majority this will remain a dream. Within capital's
restructuring, these jobs are available to a certain section of the working
class, and, while a few from the ghetto might insert themselves into that
section, the attractive security of that section is founded on an overall
recomposition of the proletariat that necessarily posits the existence of
the marginalised 'underclass'. <P>
But, leaving aside the change in the conditions which makes large scale
investment in the inner cities very unlikely, what do the gang leaders
proposals amount to ? Faced with the re-allocation of South Central
residents as unguaranteed excluded objects within capital's plan of
development, the gang leaders present themselves as negotiators of a new
deal: they seek to present the rebellion as a $1 billion warning to
American capital/state that it must bring these subjects into the fold with
the gang leaders as mediators. They are saying that they accept the
reduction of life to Work-Wage-Consumption, but that there is not enough
work (!) i.e. they want the proletariat's refusal of mediation - its direct
meeting of its needs - to force capital to re-insert them into the normal
capitalist mediation of needs through work and the wage. The gangs, with
their labour-intensive drug industry, have been operating a
crypto-Keynesian employment programme; now in their plans for urban renewal
the gang leadership want fully-fledged Keynesianism, with them instead of
the unions as the brokers of labour-power. But, even apart from the fact
that capital will not be able to deliver what the gang leaders seek, the
rebellion has shown the whole American proletariat a different way of
realising its needs; by collective direct action they can take back what's
theirs.
<P>
These demands show the similarity of gang and union leadership: how they
both act to limit the aspirations of their members to what can be met
within the capitalist order. But for all the negative aspects to the
union/gang organisation, we must recognise that they do originate from real
needs of the proletariat: the needs for solidarity, collective defence and
a sense of belongingness felt by the atomised proletarian subject. Moreover
the gangs are closer to this point of origin than the scelorised unions of
advanced capitalist countries. The gang is not <B>the</B> form of
organisation for blacks or other groups, but it is a form of organisation
that exists, that has shown itself prepared to engage in class struggle and
that has had in the past and now it seems again to have the potential for
radicalising itself into a real threat to capital. <P>
<B>Black nationalism</B>
<P>
The limitations of the practical proposals of the gang leaders are partly a
result of their conflict of interest with the ordinary members but also a
function of the limits of their ideology. The gangs' political ideas are
trapped within the limits of black nationalism.[37] But how should we view this
when their practice is so obviously beyond their theory? After all, as
someone once observed, one doesn't judge the proletariat by what this or
that proletarian thinks but by what it is necessary impelled to do by its
historical situation. The gangs took seriously Public Enemy's Farrakhan-
influenced stance on non-black businesses and 'shut em down'. Although
Farrakhan does not preach violence as a political means many in the black
gangs agree with his goal of black economic self-determination and saw the
violence as a means towards that goal. In reality this goal of a 'black
capitalism' is wrong but the means they chose were right. The tendency of
separation and antagonism shown by the rebellion is absolutely correct but
it needs to be an antagonism and separation from capital rather than from
non-black society.It is necessary that as the marginalised sector
rediscovers the organisation and political ideas thatwere repressed in the
'sixties and 'seventies that it goes beyond those positions.
<P>
But, just as blacks were not the only or even the majority of rioters, the
Crips and Bloods are not the only gangs. Chinese, Filopinos, Vietnamese,
Salvadoreans and most other Latin American immigrants have all evolved the
gang as an organisational form for youth. Now just as these gangs are far
less involved in the international side of the drug business - selling
indigenous drugs such as marijuana, PCP and speed at much smaller profit -
they also do not have the nationalist leanings of the black gangs. Before
the rebellion, a level of communication was reached between black and
Latino youth through the shared culture of rap music and the experience it
expresses. The tentative alliance between blacks and Latinos that emerged
during the uprising shows a way forward. Los Angeles and America generally
does need a rainbow coalition, but not one putting faith in Jesse Jackson;
rather, one from below focussing on people's needs and rejecting the
mediation of the existing political system. For the blacks, a leap is
required, but it will not happen through some 'battle of ideas' with the
black nationalists carried out in the abstract, but only in connection with
practice; only by and through struggle will the blacks of L.A. and the rest
of the American proletariat develop a need for communism to which the
direct appropriation of goods showed the way.

We might say the proletariat only sets itself the problems it can solve.
Only by and through a new round of struggles such as began in L.A. will
there be the opening for the American working class to find the ideas and
organisational forms that it needs. <P>
<B>9 Conclusion</B>
<P>
The rebellion in Los Angeles marked a leap forward in the global class
struggle. In direct appropriation and an offensive against the sites of
capitalist exploitation, the whole of the population of South Central felt
its power. There is a need to go on. The struggle has politicised the
population. The truce is fundamental - the proletariat has to stop killing
itself. The LAPD is worried and are surely now considering the sort of
measures they used to break the gang unity that followed the Watts
rebellion. The police are scared by the truce and by the wave of
politicisation which may follow it. That politicisation will have to go
beyond black nationalism and the incorporative leanings of the gang
leadership - another leap is required. In the multi-ethnic nature of the
uprising and the solidarity actions across the country, we saw signs that
the proletariat can take this leap. <P>
For years, American rulers could let the ghetto kill itself. In May '92 its
guns were turned on the oppressor. A new wave of struggle has begun.

[12] 'Class Composition' is used here in a double sense to cover both the objective and technical structure of labour power and the subjective side of the needs and desires of the working class. This use of the term derives from the Autonomist Marxist tradition. Central theoretical texts can be found in <I>Revolution Retrieved </I>and other Red Notes publications, also Sergio Bologna's <A href="http://geocities.com/cordobakaf/bologna.html"> 'Class Composition and the Theory of the Party at the Origin of the Workers' Councils Movement'</A>. A practical example of 'militant research' on class composition by German comrades is available in the pamphlet <A href="http://www.wildcat-www.de/en/thekla/11/t11e_kkp.htm">'Class Struggle in a German Town'</A>  <P>
[13] This is not purely or in the main an ideological process. The 'conservative revolution' that has been the ideological side to capitalist restructuring involves the mobilisation of a large section of the working class with the true middle class. American capital's success in cutting wages has not in the main affected this sector though in the present crisis it too is beginning to feel the pinch. This has meant the excluded sector has suffered immensely. The perceived necessity of pitching their appeal at the 'middle class' is now accepted by both contenders for the 1992 presidential election. However the ability of capital to consolidate a consensus for the values of an 'ideological middle class' has in America, to be put in the context of mass political abstentionism by half the population including a majority of the working class. <P>
[14] Though `underclass' is often used as a pseudonym for 'blacks' many members of other 'races' fall into this category and blacks themselves in LA and throughout America have a new 'middle class' as well as a shrinking but large proportion employed in traditional blue collar labour. <P>
[15] But both included and excluded sections, those with expanded and those with minimal consumption are still proletarian. Why? Because the proletariat's poverty cannot be alleviated by access to luxury goods. To be a proletarian is to be impoverished in the sense of having no ability to control one's life except in the choice of which way to submit to capital - the alien force that controls the means of production and subsistence. The difference between the strata is then, that while the poverty of the included sector is materially enriched, the poverty of the excluded has been intensified by their removal from access to social wealth.  <P>
[16] It is important not to see such concessions from capital as the 'buying off of discontent'. Much of the money that flooded into the inner cities following the sixties uprisings was used to fund radical initiatives. <P>
[17] "Thus at the level of material production, of the life process in the realm of the social - for that is what the process of production is - we find the same situation that we find in religion at the ideological level, namely the inversion of subject into object and vice versa" Karl Marx, <A href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1864/economic/index.htm">'Results of the Immediate Process of Production'</A> in  <I><A href="http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/index.htm">Capital</A></I>, Vol. 1 (Pelican) p. 990. <P>
[18] Of course the feature of deprivation within American capitalism is not new and neither is its falling disproportionally on blacks. Even at the height of the post-was boom many did not share in the 'American dream' but whereas when they revolted then, capital could respond by trying to give them money and jobs, at this period of capitalist crisis it will not be able to answer their demands in such a fashion. <P>

[20] Considering that we like to theorize welfare spending as a function of working class strength it should be addressed why there is an ambiguous attitude if not antipathy to welfare among many of South Central's residents. This ambivalence can be traced to the fact that, although the state is unable to completely retake the ground won by the proletariat in terms of social spending, it has been able to reorganise that welfare in capital's interest. <P>
[21] Capital's reasoning was shown in a stark form in a Newsweek article that came out after the uprising on May 18th. In the article entitled "Yes, Something Will Work: Work" Mickey Kaus argues the problem of the 'underclass' is that upward mobility has taken the 'good workers' away so that the rest are "now isolated and freed from the restraints the black middle-class had imposed. Without jobs and role models, those left in the ghettos drifted out of the labor market." But this argues the bourgeois is only possible because welfare "enabled the underclass to form. Without welfare, those left behind in the ghetto would have had to move to where the jobs are. Without welfare, it would have been hard for single mothers to survive without forming working families." So the obvious answer is the replacement of welfare with the offer of low paying government jobs: "Single mothers (and anyone else) who needed money would not be given a check. They would be given the location of a government job site. If they showed up and worked they'd be paid for their work." The result: "True natural[!] incentives to form two-parent families would reassert themselves. But even children of single mothers would grow up in homes structured by the rhythms and discipline of work." <P>

[24] Noticing a correlation between public toilets, crowds and crime, the LAPD has stopped toilets being built and closed ones that already existed. L.A. now has the lowest ratio of public toilets to people of any Western city. <P>
[25] The postmodernists and post-structuralists like to present themselves as heirs of the movement of '68. In reality, to the extent they do relate to its ideas, they are vultures feeding on the leftovers of its radical theory and regurgitating it in forms that pose no threat to capital's survival. They are the heirs of its defeat.  <P>
[26] And this role is certainly not being ignored by the repression. Under the direction of the FBI the forces of the American state have combined to get revenge on those responsible, i.e. the proletariat. 'A special "We Tipp" hotline invites people to inform on neighbours or acquaintances suspected of looting.  Elite L.A.P.D. Metro Squad units, supported by the National Guard, sweep through the tenements in search of stolen goods, while Border Patrolmen from as far away as Texas prowl the streets.' (Mike Davis, June 1st <A href="http://www.thenation.com"><I>Nation</I></A> article). The Immigration Service is used to summarily deport "illegals" who participated in the uprising. The idea behind the sweeping operations is to terrorise the whole population of South Central for its participation in the rebellion. But they also want to  get the groups who took a lead; as the FBI officer in charge said on television, they  know who was responsible for most of the attacks on property:  the street gangs, and it is this section that they are trying to target. <P>
[27] The gangs were certainly equipped to aid the uprising. Popular gang demonology would have every gang member toting an Uzi in each hand. Now, although this is certainly an exaggeration and is used by the LAPD to justify their possession and use of the most sophisticated weaponry and other equipment available to any police force anywhere (L.A. is, for example, subjected to more intensive and sophisticated helicopter surveillance than Belfast!), nonetheless the gangs are one of the most heavily armed sections of the American proletariat. It is thus interesting to note that, despite the gangs' armoury which was augmented by their systematic appropriation of gun shops they held back from killing the police. As the <A href="http://www.iht.com"><I> International Herald Tribune</I></A> (12/4/92) notes, "police killed nine rioters but rioters killed no policemen." A tactical decision perhaps? Next time... <P>

[29] The war on the gangs is another instance of the crossing over of 'race' and class. Although the gang scare and the repression it justifies can be seen largely as the repression of South Central's youth proletariat, in the L.A. context it naturally takes racist form as when the police anti-gang operations tend to criminalise black youth irrespective of their class position. <P>

[33] "The Human Relations Conference, against the advice of the police, gave a platform to sixty black gang leaders to present their grievances. To the astonishment of the officials present, the 'mad dogs' outlined an eloquent and coherent set of demands: jobs, housing, better schools, recreation facilities and community control of local institutions" Davis 1990 <I>City of Quartz</I> p. 300. <P>
[34] Of course, for the black youth of L.A., unlike for the C.I.A., drug dealing bears additional business costs - the risk of being killed by the police or by competing outfits. <P>
[35] This term refers to inter-gang blood-letting. <P>
[36] "The scale of pent-up demand for decent manual employment was also vividly demonstrated a few years ago when fifty thousand black and Chicano youth lined up for miles to apply for a few openings on the unionized longshore in San Pedro." Mike Davis<I>, City of Quartz</I> 1990,  p. 306.  <P>
[37] In fact, within the gangs alongside the high level of class hatred there is in general such a low level of theoretical awareness that it is actually the politically advanced who adhere to this ideology.
