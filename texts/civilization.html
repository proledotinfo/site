</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Civilization is under attack. A new critical current has emerged in recent 
  years, united by an antagonism towards all tendencies that seem to include 'progress' 
  as part of their programme. Perlman's book, described in the AK Distribution 
  1993 Catalogue as "One of the most significant and influential anarchic texts 
  of the last few decades" (p. 30), is one of the key texts in this 'primitivist' 
  current. In the U.S.A. and this country, it is in anarchist circles - particularly 
  amongst those engaged in eco-struggles - that primitivism has become particularly 
  popular. But Perlman used to be a Marxist (see the quote above), and he contributed 
  usefully to the development of a libertarian version of Marx's theory for a 
  number of years. The wholesale abandonment of Marx in favour of primitivism 
  has touched the non-Leninist revolutionary milieu in this country too, with 
  the recent conversion of <I>Wildcat</I>(UK)<A NAME="[2]" HREF="#[2]B">[2]</A> 
  to the anti-civilization position. 
<P>One direction that the primitivist current points in is the need to develop 
  a critique of technology. This is something the old left cannot grasp, and is 
  one of the reasons why it is unable to connect properly with tendencies toward 
  communism. According to most varieties of leftism, technological progress and 
  therefore economic growth will be of universal benefit so long as they are planned 
  rationally; what prevents the full and rational development of the forces of 
  production is the irrationality of the capitalist market. All this is reflected 
  in the way leftists relate to the new struggles over technological 'progress', 
  such as the anti-roads movement. Thus, while opportunists like the SWP treat 
  these new struggles as valid only because they might be fertile grounds for 
  recruitment to the 'real' struggle, leftists who are more openly traditional 
  on this issue - such as the RCP - repeat the old claim that what the proles 
  really want is more and better roads (so we can all get to work on time, perhaps!): 
  a modern infrastructure is necessary for growth, and an expanding economy necessarily 
  makes for a better quality of life. 
<P>The old project of simply taking over existing means of production was the 
  creation of an era before capital had so thoroughly invested its own subjectivity 
  in technology, design and the labour process. The technology that promises to 
  liberate us in fact enslaves us by regulating our activities in and through 
  work and leisure; machines and factories pollute our environments and destroy 
  our bodies; their products offer us the image of real life instead of its substance. 
  Now, more than ever, it is often more appropriate to smash existing means of 
  production than merely manage them differently. We must therefore go beyond 
  leftist notions of the neutrality of technology and problematize their definitions 
  of progress. 
<P>The current anti-roads movement offers an example of a <I>practical </I>critique 
  of progress - that is, one which contests dominant definitions of progress through 
  physically disrupting their implementation. As we argued in our last issue, 
  struggles such as that over the M11 link road in north-east London should be 
  understood as part of the class struggle. This is often despite the ideas of 
  those taking part, some of which echo Perlman's <I>ideological</I> critique 
  of progress. In contrast to the practical critique, the ideological critique 
  actively <I>hinders</I> an adequate critique of capitalism. Thus Perlman rejects 
  unwanted leftist notions only through a retreat into a form of romantic quasi-anarchism 
  which is unable to grasp the movement necessary to abolish capital. Given that 
  Perlman is only one voice, however, the present article will use a review of 
  his book as a springboard for a critique of other expressions of the new primitivist 
  current. 
<P><B>The case against 'progress'</B> <BR>
  Perlman's book begins by distinguishing between a state of nature (harmony between 
  humanity and the rest of nature) and civilization. Civilization began, not because 
  everyone wanted to improve their conditions of existence, not because of 'material 
  conditions', but because a small group of people imposed it on everyone else. 
  Perlman traces the origin of civilization to the Sumerians, who, he says, felt 
  obliged to build waterworks to ensure a regular supply of water. The Sumerians 
  invested power to direct the building of the waterworks in one individual, who 
  eventually became a powerful expert elite and then a warrior elite - the first 
  ruling class, in effect. Under the direction of their ruling class, the Sumerians 
  then waged war on their neighbours, eventually enslaving them. The rest of Perlman's 
  book is taken up with the rest of world history, comprising the evolution of 
  - and resistance to - various types of Leviathan (the name, taken from Hobbes, 
  which Perlman uses for civilization, class society or the state), each of which 
  takes in human beings as its living energy, is animated by them, and excretes 
  them out as it decays, only to be replaced by yet another Leviathan. Leviathans 
  fight with each other, but the winner is always Leviathan. Given that the opposition 
  is between Leviathan and the oppressed majority, the differences between types 
  of class society can therefore be largely glossed over. 
<P>Perlman appears to agree with Marx that what distinguishes civilization from 
  primitive communism is the development of the means of production, which enabled 
  surplus labour and thus the existence of a parasitic non-productive class. But 
  the book challenges the traditional Marxist view by suggesting that in primitive 
  communism there were already 'surpluses'.<A NAME="[3]" HREF="#[3]B">[3]</A> 
  If there was no problem with means of subsistence, then there could be no need 
  to develop the means of production. The emergence of civilization is therefore 
  comparable with the 'fall' from the Garden of Eden. 
<P>However, Perlman's claim that the ancient Sumerians felt obliged to introduce 
  technological innovation suggests that primitive communism wasn't always so 
  idyllic after all: the place where they were living was 'hellish'; they were 
  intent on 'farming a jungle'; in the rainy season the floods carried off both 
  their crops and their houses, while in the dry season their plants dried up 
  and died.<A NAME="[4]" HREF="#[4]B">[4]</A> This might suggest that population 
  growth forced people to live in marginal lands, away from any surpluses. It 
  also seems to conflict with Perlman's repeated claim that material conditions 
  were not responsible for the development of technology and thus civilization; 
  if lack of a regular water supply isn't a material condition, then what is? 
  Similarly, the material condition of a growing population isn't discussed.<A NAME="[5]" HREF="#[5]B">[5]</A> 
  The social relations Perlman describes which accompany the new technology seem 
  to be rather arbitrary. Much (the whole of history, in fact) seems to hinge 
  on the decision made by the 'wise' [sic] Sumerian elders to appoint 'a strong 
  young man' to be the 'supervisor' of the waterworks project. (So is <I>chance</I> 
  to blame rather than the small minority?) 
<P>The writings of John Zerzan, such as his collection of essays <I>Elements of 
  Refusal</I>,<A NAME="[6]" HREF="#[6]B">[6]</A> seems to take Perlman's general 
  argument further (back). Zerzan's writings are not orthodoxy within the new 
  primitivist current, but they have been important in the American primitivist 
  and eco-anarchist scenes in setting agendas for debate on issues such as agriculture. 
  The whole problem in Zerzan's view may be summarized as follows: symbolization 
  set in motion the series of horrors that is civilization's trajectory. Symbolization 
  led to ideas of time, number, art and language which in turn led to agriculture. 
  Religion gets the blame as well, being carried by language, and being one of 
  the prime culprits for agriculture: food production is "at base ... a religious 
  activity" (p. 70). But why is agriculture so bad? According to Zerzan, "captivity 
  itself and every form of enslavement has agriculture as its progenitor or model" 
  (p. 75). Therefore while Perlman might have wanted to defend existing primitive 
  communities against encroaching capitalist development, Zerzan sees anyone using 
  agriculture as already alienated and therefore not worth saving: even most tribal 
  types wouldn't be pure enough for him. Similarly, permaculture is an aspiration 
  of many primitivists, but, within Zerzan's vision, this too would be part of 
  the problem since it is a method of production. His later work<A NAME="[7]" HREF="#[7]B">[7]</A> 
  has even dismissed hunter-gathering - since hunting leads to symbolism (and 
  all the rest). 
<P>It might be easy to dismiss many of Perlman's and Zerzan's arguments as just 
  half-baked idealism. They are not particularly original, and indeed might be 
  said to be no more than vulgarizations of the ideas of Camatte (see below); 
  if we are interested in theory, it might therefore be more appropriate to develop 
  a critique of his work rather than theirs. However, Camatte is far less well 
  known and far less influential than either Perlman or Zerzan. The fact that 
  their ideas are becoming something of a material force - in the form of an increasing 
  number of people engaged in struggle espousing primitivism - means that we have 
  to take them seriously in their own right. 
<P><B>The modern context of primitivism</B> <BR>
  Ideas of a golden age and a rejection of civilization are nothing new. The Romantic 
  Movement in bourgeois philosophy began with Rousseau, who eulogized unmediated 
  relations with 'nature' and characterized 'industry' as evil. (Perlman quotes 
  Rousseau approvingly.) But why has this old idea become so popular now? 
<P>It would seem no coincidence that anti-civilization ideas have blossomed in 
  particular in the U.S.A. It is easy to see how such ideas can take hold in a 
  place where there is still a recognizable wilderness which is currently being 
  destroyed by production. The U.S.A. differs from Europe also in the fact that 
  it lacks the long history of struggle that characterizes the transition from 
  feudalism to capitalism (and the making of the proletariat). Instead, it has 
  had the wholesale imposition of capitalism on indigenous cultures - a real genocide. 
  Moreover, in recent years, the U.S.A. has also differed from Europe in the extent 
  of the defeat of proletarian struggle over there. 
<P>Defeat brings pessimism, and when the current radical movement is on the decline, 
  it may be easier to be radical about the past than to be radical in a practical 
  way in the present.<A NAME="[8]" HREF="#[8]B">[8]</A> In the biography of Perlman, 
  we can trace a movement from hope in the proletariat as the liberatory force 
  to a turn to nature and the past in the context of defeat. As a Marxist, Perlman 
  was caught up in the events of 1968, where he discovered the texts and ideas 
  of the Situationist International, anarchism and the Spanish Revolution, and 
  council communism. Afterwards, however, on moving to the U.S.A., "[t]he shrinking 
  arena for meaningful political activity in the early '70s led Fredy to see himself 
  as less of an 'activist' and more as a rememberer."<A NAME="[9]" HREF="#[9]B">[9]</A> 
  Perlman's development is closely linked with that of Jacques Camatte, sometime 
  comrade of the Italian left-communist Bordiga. Camatte broke with left-communist 
  organizations partly due to his recognition of the need to go beyond their (objectivist) 
  perspective and rethink Marx on the basis of the radical promise offered by 
  such texts as the 'Results of the Immediate Process of Production'<I> </I>(The 
  'missing sixth chapter' of <I>Capital</I>, vol. I), the <I>Grundrisse</I>, and 
  the <I>1844 Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts</I>. However, Camatte eventually 
  concluded that capital was in fact all powerful; given this, the proletariat 
  offered no hope and the only option for humanity was to run away and escape 
  somehow. 
<P>In the case of Zerzan, his early work romanticizes proletarian spontaneity; 
  on the basis of his observations of apparently new expressions of resistance 
  in the form of worker sabotage and absenteeism, he pronounced this to be the 
  future of class struggle.<A NAME="[10]" HREF="#[10]B">[10]</A> In the early 
  1980s, the recession threw millions out of work. We might take this as the vindication 
  of his critics' predictions about the transience of these forms of the revolt 
  against work as viable expressions of the class struggle; for in the face of 
  widespread unemployment how could workers commit sabotage or go absent? But 
  instead of recognizing the setbacks to the struggle as a whole, Zerzan saw in 
  the new unemployment figures the 'collapse' of capitalism and the 'vitality' 
  of the revolt against work. For those who were still in jobs, work intensity 
  increased during this period. To Zerzan, however, the most important thing, 
  was a decline of the work-ethic. Zerzan also dismissed strikes (successful or 
  otherwise) as being cathartic charades. His focus on attitudes allowed the perilous 
  state of the proletariat as a movement to be overlooked. 
<P>Zerzan's unrealistic optimism is merely the flipside of the pessimism that 
  comes with defeat.<A NAME="[11]" HREF="#[11]B">[11]</A> But holding on to such 
  ideas - substituting the simple negation of civilization for the determinate 
  negation of capitalism - is not only a reflection of pessimism with current 
  movements; it also functions to prevent adherents from connecting with these 
  movements. The ultimate test of the primitivists' case might be its usefulness 
  in struggles. Primitivists say they don't want to 'simply' go back (maybe they 
  want to go back in a more 'complex' way - in a tardis, perhaps), but neither 
  do they say much about what we should be doing now; and Perlman and Zerzan give 
  few examples of collective struggles that seem to them to point in the right 
  direction.<A NAME="[12]" HREF="#[12]B">[12]</A> In the past, Perlman and Zerzan 
  made contributions to revolutionary struggle; but whatever useful contributions 
  Zerzan may make now do not particularly seem to flow from his theory. 
<P>For the modern primitivist, the despair of failing to locate the future in 
  the present, and of failing to counteract the pervasiveness of production, may 
  leave no alternative but principled suicide (possibly in the service of a bombing 
  mission against one or other manifestation of the 'mega-machine'), or resignation 
  before Leviathan's irresistible progress, and a search for an individual solution. 
  Although primitivists see capital as a social relation, they seem to have lost 
  the sense that it is a process of class struggle, not just an imposition by 
  a powerful oppressor. Since, in their account, <I>all</I> praxis is alienated, 
  how can proletarian praxis possibly offer the way out? So, for example, George 
  Bradford, writing in <I>Fifth Estate</I>,<A NAME="[13]" HREF="#[13]B">[13]</A> 
  argues that all we can hope to do is maintain human decency, affirm moral coherence 
  and defend 'human personhood', and hope that others do the same. 
<P><B>History produces its own questioners</B> <BR>
  The argument that the turn to primitivism reflects the limits of the class struggle 
  at the present time has certain consequences for the coherence of the primitivist 
  position. To say that primitives necessarily resisted civilization may be to 
  project on to them the primitivist's own desires - specifically, her own antipathy 
  to technology and 'civilized' (i.e. class) society. Primitives very likely were 
  not conscious of their way of life as a possibility or choice in the way the 
  modern primitivist is, and therefore would not have valued it in the same way 
  that we might, and may not necessarily have resisted the development of the 
  productive forces. The desire to transcend civilization seems itself to be a 
  product of class society; the rosy view of pre-history is itself a creation 
  of history. 
<P>The issue touches upon the definition of 'human nature'. In confronting this, 
  we find two sorts of position in the writings of primitivists. Firstly, consistent 
  with Marx's approach, some acknowledge that human needs and desires are indeed 
  historical products.<A NAME="[14]" HREF="#[14]B">[14]</A> But, for the logically 
  pure primitivist, this is problematic because such needs and desires would therefore 
  be an effect of the very thing they are trying to overcome; these needs would 
  be part of history and civilization, and therefore alienated. (Recall the traditional 
  leftist view that capitalism holds back our needs for technological progress; 
  to the primitivist, needs like these would be part of the problem.) 
<P>Given this, primitivists often imply instead that the human needs and desires 
  to which civilization is antithetical are ahistorical or suprahistorical.<A NAME="[15]" HREF="#[15]B">[15]</A> 
  Perlman says nothing explicit in his book about the precise features of this 
  ahistorical human nature he seems to be positing, except that he "take[s] it 
  for granted that resistance is the natural human response to dehumanization" 
  (p. 184). The rest, we can assume, is simply the negative of his account of 
  civilization: non-hierarchical, non-working and so on. 
<P>Again, an ahistorical 'human nature' argument against capital ('civilization', 
  'government' etc.) is not a new one, and we don't have to re-invent the dialectical 
  wheel to argue against it. In fact, we can turn to some of Perlman's own work 
  for a pretty good counter-argument. In his Introduction to Rubin's <I>Essays 
  on Marx's Theory of Value</I>,<A NAME="[16]" HREF="#[16]B">[16]</A> Perlman 
  discusses Feuerbach's conception of human nature. As Perlman says, for Feuerbach 
  the human essence is something isolated, unhistorical and therefore abstract. 
  The great leap in theory beyond the bourgeois idealists made by Marx was to 
  argue against this that "the human essence is no abstraction inherent in each 
  single individual. In its reality it is the ensemble of the social relations." 
  (p. 122).<A NAME="[17]" HREF="#[17]B">[17]</A> 
<P>By contrast, then, the later Perlman makes a huge leap backwards in theory 
  to rediscover old, bourgeois notions which define human nature in terms of certain 
  negative desires located within each individual.<A NAME="[18]" HREF="#[18]B">[18]</A> 
  Similarly, Zerzan counterposes 'alienation' (be it through hierarchy, agriculture 
  or wage labour) to an asocial humanity. His more promising early writing on 
  absenteeism and sabotage was flawed by his inability to recognize the limits 
  of struggle that does not become collective.<A NAME="[19]" HREF="#[19]B">[19]</A> 
  His more recent work centres on a critique of language, that aspect of human 
  life which, probably more than any other, allows us to share and therefore makes 
  us social beings. 
<P>Primitivists' conception of the essential ontological opposition as being between 
  history (civilization) and an abstract human nature, instead of between two 
  historically-contingent sets of <I>interests</I> (capital versus the proletariat), 
  means that their critique tends to be merely a <I>moral</I> one. For example, 
  as his widow and biographer states, Perlman argues that the trail-blazers of 
  civilization did have other <I>choices</I>.<A NAME="[20]" HREF="#[20]B">[20]</A> 
  In <I>Worker-Student Action Committees</I>, a similarly voluntaristic theme 
  works as a useful critique of the limits of the practice of those taking part 
  in the events in Paris in May 1968: 'Subjectively they thought they were revolutionaries 
  because they thought a revolution was taking place ... They were not going to 
  initiate this process; they were going to follow the wave wherever it pushed 
  them.' (p. 82). But, in the absence of a proper recognition of the logical-historical 
  drives and constraints of particular modes of production, Perlman's primitivism 
  represents the degeneration of a non-objectivist version of Marxism into a version 
  of the anarchist critique of power, with all its obvious weaknesses: "These 
  leaders were just bad or stupid people!' Similarly, in the case of Zerzan, language 
  is said to have arisen not so that people could co-operate with each other, 
  but 'for the purpose of lying" (<I>Elements of Refusal</I>, p. 27). So we must 
  blame, not class interests, but people's moral failings!<A NAME="[21]" HREF="#[21]B">[21]</A> 
<P><B>Whose progress is it anyway?</B> <BR>
  Primitivists say little about variations and changes in climate in pre-historic 
  times. In certain times and places, there may well have been societies like 
  the idyll described by Perlman; but it is equally likely that other situations 
  were nightmarish. All primitive societies relied completely on the benevolence 
  of nature, something which could easily change; and changes in climatic conditions 
  could wipe out thousands. 
<P>Bound up with the primitivist view of pre-history as an ideal state is the 
  rigid distinction they draw between nature and human productive activity. What 
  makes us human are the set of 'first order mediations' between <I>humanity and 
  nature</I>: our needs, the natural world around us, our power to create, and 
  so on. To be human is to be creative. Through 'second order mediations', these 
  basic qualities of existence are themselves mediated by relationships - of power, 
  alienation, exploitation and so on - between <I>classes</I>. Zerzan idealizes 
  a golden age before humanity became distinct from nature only because he conflates 
  human creative activity per se with alienated creative activity; to him, any 
  human creative activity - any activity which affects the rest of nature - is 
  already saturated with exploitation and alienation. 
<P>What the anti-civilization position overlooks, therefore, is the <I>mutual 
  constitution</I> of humanity and (the rest of) nature: humans are part of nature, 
  and it is their nature to humanize nature. Nature and humanity are co-defining 
  parts of a single moving totality; both are therefore subject to change and 
  change each other. Changes in the world may lead to new social relations among 
  human beings - relations which may involve a different relation to that world, 
  a different praxis and technology (such as when the Iron Age developed out of 
  climatic changes). We are products of nature, but we also create ourselves through 
  our own activity in shaping the world that we inhabit. While it is certainly 
  true that to privilege 'humanity' in any of these changes may be to damage the 
  very environment we need to live, to privilege 'the natural world' by viewing 
  all our activity as an assault on it may be to damage humanity. 
<P>If the change from pre-history to agriculture and other innovations wasn't 
  necessarily alienating - if the latter weren't by their nature imposed within 
  and through social relations of domination - then the whole historical opposition 
  Perlman and Zerzan set up between progress and its popular resistance is thrown 
  into doubt. Evidence from history suggests that progress is by no means necessarily 
  the expression of the powerful; rather the powerful were sometimes indifferent 
  to progress, and the powerless were sometimes the ones who contributed to it.<A NAME="[22]" HREF="#[22]B">[22]</A> 
<P>In Antiquity, particularly in Greek society, there was technological stagnation 
  rather than progress. The surplus product of slave labour was used for innovations 
  only in the sphere of civic society and the intellectual realm. Manual labour, 
  and therefore innovations in production, were associated in the minds of the 
  Greek ruling class with loss of liberty. Although the Romans introduced more 
  technical developments, these were largely confined to the material improvement 
  of cities (e.g., central heating) and the armed forces (e.g., roads) rather 
  than the forces of production. In both cases, military conquest was preferred 
  to economic advance through the forces of production. 
<P>In the feudal period, both lords and peasants had reasons to bring innovations 
  to agriculture to increase production. The growing desires for amenities and 
  luxuries in the aristocratic class as a whole, particularly from about the year 
  1000 onwards, motivated an expansion of supply from the countryside. Hence the 
  introduction of the water-mill and the spread of viticulture. The peasants were 
  motivated to create and satisfy new needs by the particular parameters of the 
  feudal mode of production, which tied the peasant to only a certain weekly toll 
  and fixed number of days to work: the rest of the time was their own, and could 
  be used to improve their quality of life. Hence more and more villages came 
  to possess forges for local production of iron tools; cereal cultivation spread; 
  and the quality and quantity of production on the peasants' own plots increased. 
<P>The key to understanding the massive growth in productivity in the feudal period, 
  however, was the recurrent rent struggles between peasants and landowners. Disputes 
  over land, initiated by either pole of the feudal relationship, motivated occupation 
  and colonization of new lands in the form of reclamation of heaths, swampland 
  and forests for agricultural purposes. It was a continual class struggle that 
  drove the economy forward. 
<P>Primitivism, by suggesting that the initiators of progress are always the ruling 
  class, projects features of capitalism back into the past - as do most bourgeois 
  theories. Previous class societies were based largely on a settled level of 
  technology; in such societies technological change may have been resisted by 
  the ruling classes since it might have upset settled relations of dominance. 
  Capitalism is the only mode of production based on constantly revolutionizing 
  technology and the means of production. 
<P>Moreover, characterizing capitalism as simply the rule of technology or the 
  'mega-machine' fetishizes fixed capital as a prime mover, thereby losing sight 
  of the struggle behind the shape of the means of production. Progress within 
  capitalism is characteristically the result of capital responding to forms of 
  resistance. For example, in the shift to Taylorist production methods, the variables 
  that the management scientists were having to deal with were not merely technical 
  factors but the awkwardness and power of the workforce; this could best be controlled 
  and harnessed as variable capital (so the scientists thought) by physically 
  separating the job of work into its component parts and the workers along the 
  production line so they were unable to fraternize. One of the next steps in 
  improving output was the introduction of the 'human relations' approach, putting 
  a human face on the factory, which was forced upon capital by worker resistance 
  (in the form of absenteeism and sabotage) to the starkness of pure Taylorism. 
<P>Thus, we might understand progress in the forces of production not as the absolute 
  imposition of the will of one class over another, but as the result of the class 
  contradiction itself. If progress is in an important sense a compromise, a result 
  of conflict - both between classes and between competing capitals - then some 
  of its effects might be positive. We might hate capitalism, but most of us can 
  think of capitalist technologies we'd like to keep to meet our present and future 
  needs (though not as commodities, of course) - be it mountain bikes, light bulbs 
  or word processors. This is consistent with our immediate experience of modern 
  capitalism, which isn't simply imposed upon us monolithically, but has to reflect 
  our own wishes in some way. After all, isn't the essence of the spectacle the 
  recuperation of the multiplicity of our own desires? Therefore it is not some 
  abstract progress which we want to abolish, but the contradictory progress we 
  get in class society. The process of communism entails the reappropriation and 
  radical, critical transformation of that created within the alienated social 
  relations of capitalism. To hold that the problem is essentially technology 
  itself is a mystification; human instruments are not out of our control within 
  capitalism because they are <I>instruments </I>(any more than <I>our own hands</I> 
  are necessarily out of our control), but because they are the instruments of 
  <I>capital</I> - and therefore of reified, second-order mediations. 
<P>Given all this, the argument by <I>Wildcat</I><A NAME="[23]" HREF="#[23]B">[23]</A> 
  - that IF the productive forces need to be developed to a sufficient degree 
  to make communism possible, and IF these forces are <I>not</I> developed sufficiently 
  now, THEN revolutionaries might have to support their further development - 
  applies only to Marxist objectivism rather than to the version of Marx's project 
  we are trying to develop. At any time, the revolutionary supports the opposition 
  to capital (and, by extension, takes the side of any communist tendency in any 
  class society). Actions by the opposition to capital can force concessions from 
  capital, making further successful resistance possible both subjectively (confidence, 
  ideas of possibility etc.) and objectively (pushing capital beyond itself, weakening 
  its mechanisms of control etc.). 'Progress' often describes the deferment of 
  this revolutionary process, as the mode of production is forced to change its 
  form: look at the way the class compromise of the post-war settlement entailed 
  the development of new production and accumulation methods in the form of Fordism. 
  In their attack on progress, Wildcat mistake the shadows for the substance of 
  the fight. 
<P><B>Good and bad Marx</B> <BR>
  Perlman and Camatte certainly knew their Marx, and developed their early, more 
  promising, revolutionary theory through a confrontation with him. But <I>Against 
  His-story</I> and much of Zerzan's work recommend no such constructive confrontation; 
  rather they encourage a simplistic and dismissive attitude by characterizing 
  Marx as merely a nineteenth century advocate of progress. From that perspective, 
  any apparently radical critique of Marx is welcomed, including that of postmodernist 
  scumbags like Baudrillard. (<I>The Mirror of Production</I>, a book by the media 
  darling and recuperator of situationist ideas, which groups Marx with the rest 
  of the 'modernist' has-beens, is promoted in the primitivist-influenced <I>Fifth 
  Estate</I> periodical.) 
<P>A critique of Marx and Marxism is certainly necessary, but primitivism (like 
  postmodernism) is merely the ideologization of such a critique. The anti-civilization 
  position is not just a necessary attack on leftism, but a counter-productive 
  attack on everything in Marx. In defending some version of Marx against primitivism, 
  we certainly need to acknowledge the problems in attempting to separate from 
  some of its own consequences a theory which sought not merely to interpret the 
  world but to change it. However, some of the primitivist critics seem to simply 
  fit Marx up rather than attempt to understand some of the limitations of his 
  theory. For example, Zerzan's critique of Marx claims to link Marx's practice 
  with the supposed problems of this theory. But the critique consists almost 
  entirely of a list of Marx's personal shortcomings and says virtually nothing 
  about his theory.<A NAME="[24]" HREF="#[24]B">[24]</A> 
<P>At least <I>Wildcat</I> bother to dig out some quotes from Marx, which they 
  then use as evidence in a critique of (their reading of) Marx's theory. From 
  the <I>Grundrisse</I>, they find a quote to show that Marx thought that capitalist 
  progress and thus alienation was a necessary step to the full development of 
  the individual;<A NAME="[25]" HREF="#[25]B">[25]</A> and from the Preface to 
  <I>A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy</I> they quote Marx's 
  well-known statement declaring that the development of the productive forces 
  is the precondition for communism.<A NAME="[26]" HREF="#[26]B">[26]</A> These 
  kinds of theoretical statements they link to Marx's failings in practice, in 
  particular his support for the American Civil War. In response, we might pick 
  out a dozen more quotes from different texts by Marx - or even from the same 
  texts <I>Wildcat</I> draw upon - to show the importance he placed on proletarian 
  subjectivity and self-activity; and we might link these with his important and 
  innovatory contributions to revolutionary practice, such as his support for 
  the Silesian uprising and the Paris Commune. 
<P>But a mere selection (or even an aggregation) of quotes from Marx is not an 
  analysis. If we think there is anything useful in Marx's work, we could try 
  to locate his limits and contradictions in their historical context rather than 
  in the person of Marx in abstraction.<A NAME="[27]" HREF="#[27]B">[27]</A> As 
  Debord argued, Marx's limits and contradictions reflect those of the workers' 
  movement of the time. The economistic element in Marx's theory - exemplified 
  in writings such as <I>Capital </I>- was merely one facet of his project as 
  a whole. When the struggle appeared to be at its most promising, the totality 
  and hence the subjective came to the fore in Marx's theory (as in the case of 
  the overall content and direction of the <I>Grundrisse</I>); but in the face 
  of setbacks Marx was reduced to scientistic justifications. It was also important 
  rhetorically, of course, to foresee the inevitability of the communist revolution 
  in the maturation of capitalism (as in <I>The Communist Manifesto</I>, for example). 
  Understanding Marx this way allows us to critically develop his revolutionary 
  theory in the direction of communism rather than leading us simply to dump it 
  as a whole uncritically.<A NAME="[28]" HREF="#[28]B">[28]</A> 
<P>In an important sense, Marx was simply describing his observation that the 
  development of the forces of production in the end brought communism closer 
  through the proletarianization of the population. It is also true that at times 
  he was an advocate of such development. But the main point is that such advocacy 
  of capitalist progress does <I>not</I> flow from his theoretical premises in 
  the clear cut way the primitivists would have us believe. Productivism is one 
  trajectory from his work; this is the one taken up by the Soviet Marxists and 
  other objectivists in their narrow, scientistic reading. But, taking his project 
  as a whole, Marx's theory also points to the active negation of capital through 
  thoroughgoing class struggle on all fronts. 
<P><B>Theory, history and future</B> <BR>
  In approaches to history, there is an important difference between looking to 
  it for a communist ideal and attempting to understand why previous communist 
  tendencies have failed - and thus why we have more chance than the Luddites, 
  millenarian peasants, classical workers' movement etc. But in order to go beyond 
  these previous tendencies, we also need to interrogate the present and the future. 
  What new developments in technology call forth new unities within the working 
  class? Do changes to the means of communication enable those engaged in struggles 
  to understand and act more effectively upon their global significance? 
<P>To grasp present trends, we need more than the radical anthropology offered 
  by primitivists. We need theory that allows us to understand the historical 
  specificity of struggles. Capitalism is the most dynamic of class societies; 
  the proletariat is the only revolutionary class that seeks to abolish itself 
  and all classes. There are therefore many features of the present epoch of class 
  struggle that are lost in the simple gloss 'civilization'. In order to struggle 
  effectively, to understand the possible directions of struggles and the limits 
  of particular ideologies within struggles, we need to develop - not reject - 
  the categories Marx derived to grasp the capital relation and the process of 
  its negation. 
<P>'Primitivism' is itself a product of a particular period of capitalist history. 
  The same setbacks that have encouraged postmodernism among radicals in the academic 
  realm have helped produce primitivism in circles of activists. One merely describes 
  'the end of History', the other actively calls for such an end; both are an 
  inverted form of liberal idealism which reject the traditional liberal faith 
  in capitalist progress. 
<P>However, if primitivism was, like postmodernism, simply a complacent expression 
  by well-paid academics of the defeat of industrial class struggles then we wouldn't 
  bother giving it space in these pages. All of us are forced to make a response 
  to increased pollution and environmental destruction brought about by the growth 
  of the alien power that is capital; primitivism is, at best, an attempt to engage 
  in struggles around these kind of issues. The alarming and compelling new appearance 
  of the fundamental problematic of alienation, in the form of world-wide environmental 
  destruction for profit, has encouraged new forms of resistance (particularly 
  in the U.S.A.), and these new forms seek ideas. Marxism, identified with the 
  old forms (of both capital and its resistance), is seen to fail in the eyes 
  of this new wave of resisters - hence the appeal of a radical alternative, such 
  as primitivism. But the problem of primitivism lies in a flawed diagnosis of 
  the problem of Marxism: the essential problem in Marx and Marxism is not the 
  belief in <I>progress</I>, but <I>objectivism</I>.<A NAME="[29]" HREF="#[29]B">[29]</A> 
  A revolutionary theory adequate to the struggle needed at the present time must 
  therefore start with a critique of the objectivism of previous revolutionary 
  theories.<A NAME="[30]" HREF="#[30]B">[30]</A>

The all-or-nothing approach that is characteristic of varieties of ultra-leftism swings fixedly from unreasonable optimism to despair; when resistance is strong, it seems to make sense to see the proletariat as attempting always to express spontaneous revolutionary tendencies, which are hampered only by leftism and the unions.
