<p class="title">A Contribution to the Politics of the Future<br>
  The basic perspectives of The Poor, the Bad and the Angry</p>
<p class="subtitle">The world we must leave...</p>
<p>The Earth is being trashed by social relations based on money and market exchange. 
  Every government, politician, army and police force defends this system. Politicians 
  and political parties propose different management strategies for capital, but 
  regardless of their differences, Alan Greenspan and Medea Benjamin, the Fox 
  Network and Adbusters, Fidel Castro, the ecology lobby and the most bedraggled 
  college campus socialist groups all agree -- a world based on wage-slavery is 
  here to stay.</p>
<p>Most of us have nothing but our labor power, and we must sell it to an enterprise 
  to be able to live. Everything has been turned into a commodity, and exists 
  to be sold for a profit. Social life revolves around money. These facts have 
  been made to appear natural and inevitable, but they are the result of a five 
  hundred year long process of deceit, coercion and mass murder.</p>
<p>This system, capitalism, is a historically specific form of class society based 
  on the exploitation of human labor power as a commodity. Modern capitalism is 
  a totalitarian system; market relations invade all aspects of our lives and 
  degrade the world&#8217;s environment to an accelerating degree. But capitalism 
  also gives rise to social forces that can bring about the revolutionary destruction 
  of this system -- the mass collective actions of proletarians fighting against 
  poverty and exploitation.</p>
<p class="subtitle">The only war worth fighting</p>
<p>The class struggle is the key liberatory force of our time. Class struggle 
  isn&#8217;t only our fight as wage-workers against our employers. The class 
  war includes all the individual and collective struggles of exploited and propertyless 
  people all over the world against all aspects of our exploitation and impoverishment. 
  It encompasses our fights against racism, sexism and homophobia, but not as 
  separate reformist issues. Class warfare involves fights for less work, for 
  more pay, for less oppressive living and working conditions -- and the fight 
  for our power outside of and against capitalist social relations.</p>
<p>Trade unions are capitalist labor brokerages. They exist to negotiate the sale 
  of their members&#8217; labor power to employers, to keep working people in 
  line, and limit the scale of our actions against employers. Unions divert the 
  discontent of union members into harmless channels, transforming wage workers&#8217; 
  struggles into a form of interest group activity. They help us to remain passive 
  spectators in the events that most affect our lives.</p>
<p>At their best, unions were once defensive organizations, attempting to obtain 
  the highest possible price for the labor power of union members. From the 1930&#8217;s 
  onward in the US, a vast array of labor legislation helped transform the unions 
  into mechanisms of social control. Unions have ideologically and politically 
  integrated unionized workers into the capitalist system, selling them the bosses&#8217; 
  agenda during times of peace and war. And in more recent years, as their strength 
  and membership numbers have declined, unions in the US have openly advertised 
  themselves as partners of management, protecting the profit requirements of 
  capitalists against the needs of wage earners.</p>
<p>Unions often help employers reduce working people&#8217;s living standards 
  through give-back contracts. Unions undercut wage earners&#8217; power in labor 
  disputes. Unions prevent strikes from happening, they prevent strikes from spreading, 
  and prevent strikers from using the hardball tactics that are necessary to make 
  employers cave in to our demands. Unions often use goon squads to keep strikers 
  in line and halt actions that can break the back of a struck company. And when 
  strikers who have been defeated by union maneuvers return to work under worse 
  conditions than they endured before the strike, unions and their leftist camp 
  followers frequently describe their defeat as a &quot;victory.&quot; From the 
  worthless perspective of unions and leftists anything short of everybody being 
  fired and jailed is a victory, as long as the union apparatus remains in business. 
  Economists, politicians, union officials and most intelligent business leaders 
  all recognize the inherently conservative and capitalistic function of unions. 
  Union bureaucrats occasionally use combative jargon, but this has no bearing 
  on the unions&#8217; real function as labor brokerages for capital. Democratic 
  societies create a marvelous variety of false oppositions to help maintain the 
  status quo, and unions have played their role well in these terms.</p>
<p>Anarcho-syndicalism proved to be a dead-end in France in 1914, in the Mexican 
  Revolution, in Italy in 1920, and, in history&#8217;s greatest missed opportunity, 
  at the beginning of the Spanish Civil War in 1936. Unions with an ostensibly 
  revolutionary ideology and a heroic past, like the contemporary IWW, are the 
  empty organizational shell of a long-gone social movement. Today they are impoverished 
  versions of mainstream unions, and their militants often do grunt-work for the 
  bigger labor brokerages. The content of supposedly revolutionary union activity 
  is no more revolutionary than that of any other form of union activity. History 
  proves that syndicalism cannot break with a world defined by wage labor. This 
  has also been the case with new unions in places like Poland, the former USSR, 
  Mexico and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Social struggles often give rise to anti-hierarchical, collective forms of 
  action and organization, like strike committees outside of and against the control 
  of the unions, or mass public assemblies: these can be forms of real working 
  class power. But any permanent formal organization of the working class outside 
  of a context of mass action will end up becoming part of the bosses&#8217; political 
  apparatus, and get in the way of our fight for a better life.</p>
<p>In taking action in the workplace, and in extending actions beyond the workplace, 
  wage workers have to fight outside of and against all unions and unionist ideologies. 
  Our only way forward will be to create new forms of wildcat action and self-organization 
  that won&#8217;t be limited to a single job category or industry, or limited 
  to the workplace itself. We will have to do an end-run around the unions and 
  the anti-working class labor laws they serve. This perspective has to become 
  present in even the most limited and immediate struggles. It has to include 
  strategies for large-scale action against employers and governments across regional 
  and national boundaries.</p>
<p class="subtitle">The ladies and gentlemen of the left</p>
<p>In 1973, in Eclipse and Re-emergence of the Communist Movement, Jean Barrot 
  noted, &quot;The first condition for a minimum revolutionary action is to break 
  decisively with all forms of Official Marxism...Official Marxism is part of 
  capitalist society in its theory as well as its practice. Compromising in this 
  field means remaining on the side of capital.&quot;</p>
<p>From Kronstadt in March 1921 to the Guatemalan highlands in the 1980&#8217;s, 
  the Soviet Union and its satellite parties played a direct role in the defeat 
  of every significant revolutionary movement of the 20th century. The former 
  Soviet Union, Mao's China, Cuba, etc. were not socialist societies, but state 
  capitalist systems, moments in the unfolding of capitalist domination over the 
  earth. Under state capitalism, the ruling party imposed industrial wage labor 
  on formerly agrarian laboring classes, exploited the working populace and kept 
  them politically powerless. This development of the means of production was 
  a wholly capitalist modernization process, with the party-state developing the 
  means of production on the backs of the laboring classes in ways that more backward 
  elites or colonial rulers were unwilling to or incapable of doing. &quot;Socialist&quot; 
  regimes had nothing in common with socialism, or with the best elements of the 
  classical workers&#8217; movement, or with the fight for a classless society.</p>
<p>Democracy, fascism and Stalinism were not qualitatively different forms of 
  civilization in conflict with one another. They were different management strategies 
  for industrial capitalist class societies that were at different phases of historical 
  development. All forms of capitalism and the state are equally murderous and 
  anti-revolutionary.</p>
<p>Social democracy and Leninism were part of the left wing of capital; they offered 
  populist and statist management strategies for integrating the working class 
  into capitalist society. &quot;Personal politics,&quot; individualist anarchism 
  and lifestyle anarchism are also forms of fake radicalism, although they are 
  by virtue of their self-marginalizing and largely laughable character less of 
  a threat to a future mass revolutionary movement than social democracy and Leninism 
  have been. An awareness of history is everything. In both small and large-scale 
  social struggles we must understand the past and make a complete break with 
  failed strategies and obsolete politics.</p>
<p>In national liberation movements, people of non-exploiting social classes pin 
  their hopes for a better life behind the political ambitions of the local bourgeoisie, 
  or a substitute bourgeoisie of guerrilla bosses and professional intellectuals. 
  These hopes have proven to be futile. No nationalist struggle has given rise 
  to a society ruled by working people. Nationalism isolates working people from 
  one another. Regardless of the egalitarian language that nationalists sometimes 
  use to mobilize the masses, all successful nationalist struggles have produced 
  regimes that are cops for the world market and local elites against wage workers, 
  impoverished peasants and indigenous people. A Turkish proverb says it well: 
  &quot;When the ax came into the forest, the trees said: the handle is one of 
  us.&quot;</p>
<p>The FMLN, FARC, IRA, PLO, ANC, ETA, etc. are pro-capitalist organizations and 
  enemies of the working class. They have more in common with existing nation 
  states and multinational corporations than with what Frederich Engels called 
  &quot;the real movement that abolishes existing conditions.&quot; Capitalism 
  is a global system and our fight is international; all forms of tribalism, patriotism 
  or nationalism are anti-human and counter-revolutionary, a psychological disease 
  of class society closely akin to racism. Anyone, including self-proclaimed Marxists 
  and anarchists, who supports any form of nationalism or the state in time of 
  peace or war is on the side of capital against the interests of the vast majority 
  of humanity. This includes Subcommandante Marcos!</p>
<p>Our class has to fight alone for what we need against the property-owning classes. 
  All &quot;popular fronts,&quot; or alliances between the exploited and other 
  social classes, or &quot;united fronts&quot; between rebellious working people 
  and pro-capitalist workers&#8217; organizations (unions and parties of the left) 
  have lead to the defeat and often the massacre of working people, like in Spain 
  in the 1930&#8217;s and in Chile in the early 1970&#8217;s.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Force, violence and dictatorship in the class struggle</p>
<p>The state is the mechanism the ruling class uses to maintain its monopoly of 
  violence over other social classes. Every government in the world is a repressive 
  apparatus defending capitalist property relations. The state is not a socially 
  neutral institution, or a tool that can be used by working class and poor people. 
  Authentic opposition to capitalism begins with unconditional hostility to all 
  forms of the state, and to bourgeois elections and legality.</p>
<p>Electoral politics is a psychologically sophisticated scam hustling voters 
  into thinking they have a real say in how they are governed. The right to vote 
  is intended to keep us mystified, atomized and passive, and is amazingly effective 
  in keeping us from taking effective action against the private sector elite. 
  Nothing fundamental can be changed by atomized individuals, and supposed small 
  gains won by working and poor people in elections are inevitably eroded away 
  to nothing by those who really hold power. The only source of positive social 
  change has always been direct action: working class people acting together on 
  the terrain of daily life, where we work and where we live, and fighting for 
  what we need against bosses, corporations and the rich -- outside of and completely 
  against the conventional decision-making institutions of this society.</p>
<p>Democratic ideology is the central element in a bodyguard of lies maintaining 
  the power of the capitalist class. The market economy rules as an absolute dictatorship 
  over life on earth today. You cannot vote your way around that fact. Market 
  forces cannot be resisted by voting. Regardless of what they say, anyone who 
  runs for office or attempts to hustle working people into voting is trying to 
  fool us into thinking that we have a stake in the existing state of things. 
  Any form of participation in electoral politics by working people short-circuits 
  the emergence of what we really need; a mass political culture that will be 
  independent of and irreconcilably antagonistic to the market and the state.</p>
<p>In strikes, riots and a thousand other forms of action the working class must 
  use violence against the dictatorship of the market. The class struggle isn&#8217;t 
  a peaceful process -- might makes right. Only large-scale, conscious, organized 
  action can bring working and poor people victory in the class war.</p>
<p class="subtitle">The anti-state communist program</p>
<p>The forces in global capitalist society that make a revolutionary movement 
  possible in one area or region will simultaneously give rise to revolutionary 
  possibilities in many other parts of the world. An international revolt against 
  capitalism broke out after World War One, from Russia in 1917 to Spain in 1937, 
  and a similar upheaval took place all over the globe during the late 1960&#8217;s. 
  As capitalism becomes a more globally unified system a working class response 
  to capital can become more globally united as well. Unfortunately war is often 
  the best midwife of a major revolutionary crisis, and this is by far the most 
  likely source of such an event for the United States.</p>
<p>Social revolution will be an international phenomenon. It will require the 
  violent destruction of the state in an armed insurrection or mass uprising, 
  simultaneous with the seizure of the means of production and distribution by 
  the wage slave class. A central aspect of this will be to disperse the police 
  and bring about the collapse of the state&#8217;s armed forces through desertions, 
  sabotage, fraternization and mutiny. At its high point, a mass revolutionary 
  movement may acquire an irresistible quality that will sweep aside obstacles 
  with a surprising and improbable speed.</p>
<p>During this period of rapid transition from capitalism to stateless communism, 
  the mass revolutionary movement will have to maintain an absolute monopoly of 
  power over and against the defeated capitalist class. We will abolish all forms 
  of unnecessary toil. There will be no more office work; we will immediately 
  abolish all banks, insurance companies, stock markets and brokerage houses, 
  law firms, advertising, the corporate media apparatus and government bureaucracies; 
  we will gradually dismantle all the ecologically harmful industries and technologies 
  that capital has throttled the earth with, chief among them extractive industries 
  and the private automobile. Most computer systems will be trashed. Social life 
  will move at a much slower rhythm. The most important point of all is that all 
  forms of market relations -- working for wages, trade, exchange, the use of 
  money -- must be quickly, completely and permanently done away with.</p>
<p>The abolition of capitalism doesn&#8217;t mean democracy, nationalization of 
  major industries, power in the hands of leftists or workers&#8217; self-management 
  of the economy. The goal of an authentic revolutionary movement is the abolition 
  of wage labor, the abolition of the market economy, the destruction of all states, 
  standing armies and national borders; the emergence of new social relations 
  where poverty is abolished and labor no longer rules social life: a classless, 
  stateless, moneyless, global human community. In a post-capitalist world, productive 
  activity will be performed for the free and direct satisfaction of human needs 
  while respecting the integrity of the Earth&#8217;s environment. Everyone will 
  have equal power and can contribute to the best of their ability; we will all 
  have an equal voice in how society is run and equal access to the wealth we 
  create.</p>
<p>In spite of their flaws and limits, the defeated social revolutions of the 
  20th century, and the mass collective violence of the poor in revolt from Los 
  Angeles to Iraqi Kurdistan, are embryonic expressions of the future anti-statist 
  class dictatorship of the poor against capital worldwide, what must become a 
  consciously communist movement without borders or compromises, a new world trying 
  to come alive. Social revolution, and class struggles that tend towards communism, 
  require despotic action by the dispossessed against the system that dispossesses 
  us -- a dictatorship of our needs against the dictatorship of exchange value. 
  The destruction of commodity relations and the emergence of authentic human 
  community aren&#8217;t just measures that will be enacted &quot;The Day After 
  The Revolution&quot;. These communist urges live today as an impulse in collective 
  struggles, and in many small gestures and attitudes. Anti-capitalist revolutionaries 
  fight to spread and develop these perspectives with an organized, aggressive, 
  long-term involvement in contemporary social struggles. </p>
