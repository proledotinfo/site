<p class="title">The Italian Background</p>
<p class="author">by Ernest Dowson</p>
<p class="subtitle">Reconstruction&#8221; and &#8220;Economic Growth</p>
<p>After the Second World War, the Italian ruling class, aided by the Marshall 
  Plan, began the reconstruction of a capitalist economy. The parties of the Left, 
  including the Communists, co-operated with them. The revolutionary hopes of 
  the workers who had fought against Fascism were traded for a seat in the Government. 
  All over the country anti-fascist groups, who had been armed since the time 
  of the Resistance and were now preparing to combat the presence of the US, were 
  persuaded to lay down their weapons. Once the threat of armed insurrection was 
  out of the way, the bourgeoisie swiftly ousted the Communists from the Government 
  and set about a program of suppressing working-class organizations. The trade 
  unions, particularly the militant metal workers&#8217; union (FIOM) at Fiat, 
  were broken up. Conditions were now ripe for the exceptional growth of Italian 
  industry, which lasted from 1948 to 1962. During this period, with considerable 
  financial backing from the State, massive investment occurred, especially in 
  export based industries and automobile production. Industry was streamlined, 
  and the most modern methods were introduced into the factories. This growth, 
  far from benefiting the workers, was largely paid for by them through the low 
  wages and lousy living conditions they endured. Since the new industry was highly 
  automated it only very slowly created jobs, and unemployment remained high throughout 
  the period.</p>
<p class="subtitle">The South</p>
<p>This industrial growth was concentrated in the northern cities and was based 
  on a policy of keeping the South poor and underdeveloped. Southern Italy&#8217;s 
  position in relation to the North is very much like that of the North to the 
  South in the US, or that of Ireland (North and South) to the UK. Predominantly 
  an area of agricultural work, it has a long history of a client system based 
  on large landowners. Jobs, homes, schools, everything depended on the patronage 
  of the local boss. This system was maintained after 1945, with the difference 
  that control was no longer in the hands of the landlords, but was now in the 
  hands of government officials who handled public money. Agriculture was &#8220;rationalized&#8221; 
  into larger units and mechanized, and millions of people were driven off the 
  land into the cities, especially Naples and Rome. Between 1950 and 1967, some 
  17,000,000 Italians, more than a third of the population, moved from one district 
  to another. Although a certain amount of small industry and construction work 
  did come to the South, it was not enough to prevent a massive migration to the 
  North. This constant reserve of labor was exactly what the Italian bosses needed. 
  It helped to keep wages down, even when the demand for workers began to grow.</p>
<p>The year 1962 brought the first halt to this murderous progression. The workers 
  at Fiat came out on strike and demonstrated in the streets of Turin. The demand 
  for workers, caused by the boom of 1959, was beginning to push wages up, while 
  unemployment was falling. Italian bosses began to find it more and more difficult 
  to make the massive profits to which the boom years had accustomed them. Investment 
  began to tail off, and more and more money went abroad or into other more lucrative 
  areas such as property speculation. Now, instead of pushing up productivity 
  by the introduction of new machinery, as they had been doing, they began to 
  put the squeeze on workers to work harder. Speeds on the production lines were 
  pushed up and up, to become the highest in Europe. The years during which their 
  organizations had been smashed gave Italian workers no chance, for the time 
  being, of resisting this process.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Conditions in the Cities</p>
<p>The bosses managed to retain the upper hand, and conditions for the workers 
  grew worse. Unemployment rose once more, and the prices of food, housing, and 
  transportation shot up in an ever-growing inflationary spiral. Life in the cities 
  became unbearable. The growth of Italian capitalism had involved a massive influx 
  of people into the towns. From 1951 to 1961, the four largest urban districts 
  (Milan, Rome, Turin, and Naples) and their outlying districts had a population 
  increase of 2,000,000, two-thirds of the total national increase in population. 
  From 1951 to 1969, the population of Turin and its suburbs alone grew from 868,000 
  to 1,528,000. The bosses and their State did nothing at all to make this forced 
  migration less painful. Public housing was minute. The main State agency, GESCAL, 
  built only 390,000 apartments between 1949 and 1971- the same number that was 
  built privately in one year. In 1971, GESCAL built 3,254 apartments and had 
  a waiting list of 138,931 families. GESCAL gets its money from the workers and 
  the employers. The workers&#8217; contribution is 0.6% of their wages, and the 
  bosses&#8217; is twice that. A good deal of this money disappears through corruption. 
  The rest is invested either in industry or abroad, and will remain there, since 
  it takes years for GESCAL to get planning permission for its projects. More 
  over, GESCAL usually gets outbid for the little land that becomes available 
  by private developers. Thus workers had to find accommodation where they could. 
  People often had to sleep six to eight to a room, and shanty towns spread around 
  the large cities. When apartments could be found, rents consumed up to 40% of 
  a worker&#8217;s wages.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Bosses&#8217; Crisis, Workers&#8217; Struggle</p>
<p>By 1968 the workers were beginning to fight back once more. The Incidence of 
  strikes and absenteeism grew rapidly, and in the South there were a number of 
  violent riots. At this time the Italian economy was entering another difficult 
  phase. Competition for markets was increasing between Italian firms and rival 
  firms, especially from the US. In many cases there was direct competition between, 
  say, Fiat and Ford, Pirelli and Firestone, or Italian oil companies and their 
  US equivalents. This process was reflected also in an increasing antagonism 
  between different sectors of Italian capital: between large scale industries, 
  Italian owned and heavily subsidized by the State and small scale industry, 
  relying on or even owned by US companies. The small firms were increasingly 
  faced with either liquidation or absorption into one or another of the larger 
  monopolies.</p>
<p>In 1969 many of the important three-year labor contracts in the metal working 
  industry were due to expire, over 50 of them. Many of the large firms were eager 
  to negotiate new terms and to settle with the unions as peacefully as possible, 
  thereby avoiding large scale disruptions of production. For their part the trade 
  unions and the CP, and their parliamentary spokesmen, were ready to make a deal. 
  They were hoping to strengthen their own position and to have their Importance 
  recognized officially. The CP had dreams of once more of entering the Government. 
  They were also worried by the existence of several unofficial workers&#8217; 
  committees and &#8220;base committees&#8221; which had emerged during the previous 
  year. In exchange for industrial peace they would ask for higher wages and the 
  promise of social reforms. But to ensure their bargaining position they had 
  to mobilize the workers, at least enough to show their strength. And this was 
  their big mistake, because the workers had had enough. They weren&#8217;t going 
  to play the game of token gestures.</p>
<p class="subtitle">THE &#8220;HOT AUTUMN&#8221;</p>
<p>Before the unions could sell them out, the workers were on the move. They soon 
  went far beyond the control of the unions. For instance, when workers at Fiat 
  were called out on a one-day token strike protesting the killing of a Southern 
  worker during the rioting at Battipaglia, they refused to leave the factory, 
  and started to take it over instead. Very quickly people began to develop aims, 
  tactics, and organization which had nothing to do with what the unions were 
  after. They didn&#8217;t just want a wage increase; they wanted the abolition 
  of the grading system, equal pay raises for all, and a drastic reduction in 
  work speed. Rather than passively coming out on strike, as the unions wanted 
  them to, they began to organize a struggle inside the factories, with mass meetings 
  on the job, rotating strikes in different sections which brought production 
  to a standstill, marches through factories involving a lot of damage to plants, 
  and direct confrontation with management. New organizations began to take control 
  of the struggle, base committees at Pirelli (Milan) and at the chemical works 
  in Porto Marghera, and the worker-student assembly at Fiat Mirafiori (Turin). 
  Factory newspapers began to appear. Links were established with groups of students, 
  and meetings were held regularly at factory gates.</p>
<p>This explosion inside the factories demonstrated decisively that the &#8220;economic 
  partnership&#8221; which the bosses and the unions were interested in would 
  not happen. The growing use by Italian firms of assembly-line production techniques 
  had drastically changed the nature of work and the work force. The older, skilled 
  workers, with pride in their work, who had been the backbone of the trade unions 
  and the CP, had no place among a newer generation of workers whose individual 
  skills were unimportant and who didn&#8217;t give a damn about the &#8220;dignity 
  of labor&#8221;. Many of these young workers had come from the South, from agricultural 
  communities with a long history of direct and violent struggle, where the burning 
  down of the local town hall and the occupation of land were common happenings. 
  They were part of a militant tradition, but not part of a trade union tradition. 
  So when the militancy of these workers came into the open, the unions were not 
  able to channel the struggle into demands for higher wages and reforms, as the 
  French unions did in 1968. In the hope of buying peace, the bosses desperately 
  made big concessions on wages. Between 1969 and 1970 wages went up by 23.4% 
  compared with an average annual increase of only 9% over the previous 10 years.</p>
<p>The signing of the contracts was concluded only a few weeks after 16 people 
  were killed by fascist bombings in the center of Milan. The ruling class was 
  developing two tactics for dealing with the militancy of the workers concessions 
  and reforms on one hand, and open repression on the other. The continuation 
  of the struggle inside the factories and its extension into the communities 
  meant that the ruling class increasingly chose the second option. In the factories 
  militants were sacked or moved into other jobs, fascists were planted to spy 
  on militant workers, and many small firms closed down. At the same time, unemployment 
  and prices rose sharply.</p>
<p class="subtitle">1969-1973: Four Years of Struggle</p>
<p>Since the &#8220;Hot Autumn&#8221; of 1969, the class struggle in Italy has 
  spread from the factories to every area of people&#8217;s lives. The working 
  class has fought against their rotten housing conditions with widespread and 
  prolonged rent strikes and mass occupations of empty flats. People have fought 
  against rising food prices, expensive transportation, inadequate schools and 
  nurseries, and lousy medical facilities. They have begun to create within their 
  communities a new way of life, outside the control of the bosses. What&#8217;s 
  more, Italian immigrants have taken the germ of this struggle beyond their national 
  frontiers to other major European cities.</p>
<p>Rents: Throughout the country thousands of tenants have been on rent strikes, 
  some lasting for several years. Tenants&#8217; slogans have been &#8220;The 
  only fair rent is no rent!&#8221; and &#8220;Housing is a right. Why pay rent?&#8221; 
  Independent organizations like the Milan Tenants Union make sure that control 
  of the struggle stays in the hands of the tenants themselves.</p>
<p>Occupations of buildings: Hundreds of people have been involved in taking over 
  empty buildings. In Milan, during one series of occupations, 30,000 marched 
  in a revolutionary demonstration through the city. In Taranto 182 families occupied 
  a public-housing project In February 1973. The police came to throw the families 
  out, but were forced to leave when the squatters were joined by hundreds of 
  workers from Italsider, the steel plant, some of whom were squatting themselves.</p>
<p>Food prices: Militant women have picketed supermarkets. In Milan there were 
  clashes with police. In Pisa, people organized a Red Market.<br>
  Transportation: In Spinea and Mirano (suburbs of Venice) workers and students 
  stopped all busses from running as part of a campaign against high fares and 
  bad service. They took some of them over and drove them all over the area. In 
  Trento, workers commuting to factories refused to pay fares, saying that their 
  wages were low enough.</p>
<p>Schools: There have been strikes and occupations of primary and secondary schools 
  and universities in every major city. Since the autumn of 1969, when worker-student 
  assemblies were formed, there have been many occasions on which workers and 
  students have fought alongside each other. In the schools, the kids have fought 
  for free books, free transportation, an end to exams, an end to the class bias 
  in education, the opening of schools to the community, and so on.</p>
<p>Health: In Rome a Red Health Center was set up to provide free medical treatment. 
  It became a center for organizing struggles around living and working conditions, 
  the real causes of ill health. Throughout the country, Left-wing doctors have 
  become involved in fighting class based medicine. For example they have given 
  evidence in court cases involving workers whose health has been impaired by 
  factory conditions. Their evidence has been essential in combating the evidence 
  of the bosses&#8217; doctors.</p>
<p>Prisons: Prisoners in many Italian jails have been fighting against their conditions. 
  In prisons in Milan and Naples cells have been set on fire and prisoners have 
  gone onto the roofs with banners. A Red Help organization has been formed to 
  support their struggles from the outside.</p>
