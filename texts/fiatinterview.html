<p class="title">AN INTERVIEW WITH WORKERS AT FIAT</p>
<p><em>Three Workers from FIAT Mirafiori describe the experiences of the Southern 
  immigrant coming to work in the industrial cities of the North. The conversation 
  was recorded in Turin during December 1970.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong>It was only after the summer of 1969 that people in Britain 
  began to hear of the struggles at FIAT. Was there a tradition of struggle before 
  the middle of 1969, or were these clashes the beginning of the revolutionary 
  movement of FIAT?</p>
<p><strong>LUIGI: </strong>You mean was it that they broke the lethargy of the 
  last 20 years here? &#8216;Yes, it was. Of course, there were struggles before 
  this time, but all were dominated by the Unions. And they were struggles that 
  came around at fixed intervals when the unions set them. So every two or three 
  years, when the contracts were about to expire, we would have the classic sort 
  of struggle you know, two or three days of strikes, all kept within union channels, 
  and then the boss&#8217;s repression would begin all over again. And the little 
  politicization achieved through those two or three days would be blocked for 
  the next three years of boss&#8217;s rule.</p>
<p>But then, in about 1966, the immigrants from the South began to arrive. And 
  the whole social situation in Turin blew up, what with (the shortage of housing, 
  lightning price increases, building speculation and so on, All of a sudden there 
  were l0 to 15 thousand people arriving in the city, and quite apart from the 
  way the Prices rocketed. there were not the facilities to cope with them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong>When did the three of you arrive in FIAT?</p>
<p><strong>LUIGI:</strong> These two are young. For my part, I&#8217;ve been at 
  FIAT for twenty years. This lot is the new generation who&#8217;ve broken with 
  everything that we&#8217;ve become used to.</p>
<p><strong>TONI:</strong> I&#8217;ve been here for two years and I joined FIAT 
  right at the time that the struggles started.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong>When you two arrived in Turin, what was it like for you?</p>
<p><strong>N1NO:</strong> I&#8217;ve been here for a couple of years now. For 
  most of the time I&#8217;ve worked in small places you know, sweatshops, always 
  inside Turin, and then I was taken on at FIAT, in the beginning I didn&#8217;t 
  know anything about anything. But the political work there was already well 
  underway, and there were students doing leafleting at the factory, explaining 
  a few things to people, like what the union was all about. Then we had that 
  whole big explosion during 1969. Everything went up. Boom!</p>
<p><strong>TONI:</strong> I&#8217;d never seen anything like this in all my life. 
  Because, as you know, I come from Calabria and my town&#8217;s a pretty small 
  place. It&#8217;s ruled by God, you might say: Three or four priests, who were 
  all a bunch of shits, brought us up to be boy scouts and the like, and told 
  us all about what they thought democracy was. Then there were the four or five 
  Communists and the seven or eight fascists, and that&#8217;s it. Really Calabria 
  is still a region that&#8217;s in the hands of the counts and barons that ran 
  the place in the time of Mussolini, and who did very well out of him, what with 
  their power, their villas, and so on. That&#8217;s the way Calabria is. </p>
<p>Anyway, down there, even if I only had 50 lire I could always buy myself a 
  cheese roll or something. But I come up to Turin and fuck it: I find I&#8217;m 
  paying out 200! It was all crazy to me. Then I began to pick up on the politics 
  that Lotta Continua were into. At first, you know, I really didn&#8217;t understand 
  too much, I used to read their leaflets, but only in a sort of informative way, 
  so as to know what they were saying. One day one of the student comrades from 
  Lotta Continua hunted me out and began talking to me. He really attacked me 
  because I was still in the union. Before I worked at FIAT I&#8217;d worked for 
  a few months at other little factories, and all that I&#8217;d heard was that 
  the unions were there to defend the workers. Of course, down in Calabria we 
  don&#8217;t even know what a union is; people don&#8217;t know that they exist! 
  But gradually I began to understand what they really are. There are so many 
  things I&#8217;ve learned that I didn&#8217;t know before, and I hope to be 
  able to pass them on to all my workmates in the factory, and help them understand 
  for themselves what I&#8217;ve learned.</p>
<p>At the beginning, when we were few, we started our struggles going round the 
  factory in huge processions that you would think were never going to end. We 
  used to call them &#8220;Snakes&#8221;. One time there were three hours of official 
  union strike called. This was about the time that all the big strikes were happening, 
  in autumn 1969. A few of us got together with other militants and asked ourselves 
  what we were going to do. We decided that the best thing would be to have a 
  Snake a big march round the factory, pulling out everyone we could. So there 
  we were, with the three-hour union strike, and the two of us got together with 
  five or six other comrades and contacted a few people from Lotta Continua. Then 
  we set off; just the seven of us. And by the time we got to the head offices 
  where all the staff hung out, there were about seven thousand of us! Bloody 
  beautiful it was. The staff were all looking out of the windows, and saw us 
  down below. They didn&#8217;t know what to do. And the few guards on the doors 
  were terrified. It was beautiful .Now when the next lot of contracts comes along, 
  well, this year we started with seven of us and ended up with seven thousand. 
  Next time we&#8217;ll start with seven thousand and end up with seventy thousand, 
  and that&#8217;ll be the end of FIAT. Goodbye, Agnelli.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s another time that I remember was really fine. We&#8217;d been 
  in and out on strikes for a couple of days, and then we were having one of those 
  marches inside the factory. And people started saying: &#8216;Let&#8217;s kick 
  out the supervisors, they&#8217;ve been around giving orders for about a hundred 
  years now, and we&#8217;ve had enough!&#8221; So we went down and started muting 
  them out. People were looking at them, jeering, spitting on them, and they looked 
  back as if they wanted to kill us, but there wasn&#8217;t a thing they could 
  do. They just didn&#8217;t know what was happening. There&#8217;s them who&#8217;ve 
  worked their asses off to become supervisors, and there we were treating them 
  like shit.</p>
<p><strong>LUIGI:</strong> It was these young people who began the fight, spontaneously 
  and we logically found that this was a sort of alternative to the usual Union 
  struggles, an alternative which went along with the contacts growing at the 
  same time with the students. As you know, from 1967 the university movement 
  joined up with the struggles of the workers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> What has been the relationship between the revolutionary 
  workers and the militants from the student movement?</p>
<p><strong>LUIGI:</strong> It&#8217;s been a sort of team effort really, them 
  outside and us inside. At the start we would work on all the antagonisms inside 
  the factory, using them as a lever. For example, say FIAT hadn&#8217;t provided 
  some work clothes. We would kick up a fuss, and the students would support us 
  from the outside with loud hailers, gate meetings, leaflets, big posters, and 
  so on.</p>
<p>Usually what we do is find out the facts of the situation, write them out in 
  rough form, and give them to the external militants to print because they&#8217;re 
  good at that sort of thing and they have more time than we do to work right 
  through the night. We hope that later on we shall begin to do the leaflets ourselves, 
  and already we are starting to do more of the work like typing and so on, as 
  well as some of the distribution outside the gates. Once upon a time it was 
  the ex-students that held the leading role in Lotta Continua, and we were the 
  ones that carried out programs. Now we are beginning to take the leadership. 
  There&#8217;s a bit of confusion about this at the present, as to whether we 
  should have the leadership of the organization, because they still control a 
  lot of the apparatus, like the national newspaper, the duplicators, poster printing 
  facilities, and so on. However I&#8217;d say that by now there&#8217;s really 
  joint leadership.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> So you can really say that the new wave of struggle arrived 
  with the immigrants and the students?</p>
<p><strong>LUIGI:</strong> Yes. Italian students understood very early on, first 
  with the Movimento Studentesco (Student Movement), and then with the ultra-left 
  groups, that the only way they could expect to have any life at all was by allying 
  themselves with the struggles of the workers. So that was really how it all 
  started. Apart from very early factory leafleting in isolated areas, like Pisa 
  from 1964, it was in 1967 that the really massive work began in front of the 
  factory gates. And this was exactly when all the new workers began to be signed 
  on, all the workers from the South, cut off from their own roots who had burned 
  their bridges behind them and come here to Turin to find themselves without 
  houses fit to live in, with sky-high prices and so on. Add to that the students 
  outside, who were focusing on these problems, pushing them toward eruption, 
  and of course everything exploded. But it exploded in ways that were sometimes 
  very disorganized, very unconnected, sometimes a real mess.</p>
<p>Now the spontaneous struggles are over. I&#8217;m convinced of it. Now, when 
  the struggles start again, they&#8217;re going to have to be struggles for organization. 
  Last year we were fighting seven or eight at a time, limited to single shops, 
  all of us at Mirafiori linked through Lotta Continua because we&#8217;d had 
  enough of the unions. But now we&#8217;re moving toward a situation in which 
  we&#8217;ll have the factory coordinated shop by shop. When we decide at a certain 
  point to launch a strike, we&#8217;ll start with an assembly in one shop, say 
  Shop 55. Then we&#8217;ll begin the roundup, setting off in a Snake toward, 
  say, the Varnish Shop, before we used to waste two or three hours getting everyone 
  together. And by that time, as we were going round collecting the comrades, 
  the anger would somehow melt away. To coordinate the struggle inside the factory 
  means that when we decide on a Snake, it no longer takes half an hour to get 
  it moving. Every group, every shop moves together. And when we start, we can 
  come to a certain point where we can decide on what objective we are going to 
  be heading for. We can decide to leave the factory grounds and tie up with other 
  area factories, radicalizing the struggle outside the factory so as to involve 
  other places.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong>What has been the role of the unions during these struggles?</p>
<p><strong>LUIGI: </strong>The unions are there to make sure that workers are 
  kept inside the system, and have less possibility of beginning to challenge 
  it. The unions are the political extensions of the sicknesses that exist inside 
  the government; the &#8220;long arm inside the factories&#8221; of political 
  parties. Every group, every political party has a little hand inside the factory. 
  The Christian Democrats have CISL, the Communists have the CGIL, SIDA are the 
  Fascists, UIL is the Social Democrats, even some Republicans. . . every one 
  of them has a certain presence inside the factory to control the situation. 
  Now a lot of workers understand this. However they don&#8217;t as yet have an 
  alternative. Inside FIAT the unions don&#8217;t count for anything, and everyone&#8217;s 
  well aware of where they stand. But at the moment they are the only organization 
  with a voice, they are the only ones that can say anything when it comes to 
  dealing with management. So what&#8217;s really necessary at the moment is that 
  we begin to create inside the factory agitational nuclei, or revolutionary committees, 
  that are so strong and so well-rooted among the workers that they are an alternative 
  to the internal commissions and the delegates that the unions have set up. Thus 
  we can begin to create a point of reference in the factory to which the less 
  politicized workers can look, so that they can escape from the control of the 
  unions, can talk together, and can politicize themselves further. That is exactly 
  what we&#8217;re engaged in at the moment: to form nuclei, to come to some agreement 
  among ourselves, to study and understand the situation, and to provide inside 
  the factory a focal point. These agitational nuclei are composed of normal workers 
  inside the factory, but the best of them, the activists. It must be said that 
  these nuclei are being formed not only from members of Lotta Continua, but also 
  from workers who are not members but who have understood this need and who come 
  along with us because of that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Q. </strong>What are your aims with these agitational nuclei inside 
  of the factories?</p>
<p><strong>LUIGI:</strong> With the nuclei and with the revolutionary committees 
  if we manage to create them, we are trying, not to be another union, but to 
  provide a political, revolutionary perspective for the workers. We must not 
  fall into economism, into parochialism. We must not say &#8220;Look, we must 
  fight for five lire more, or for ten lire more, or to work one or two hours 
  less.&#8221; We are fighting and of course we are not going to achieve it tomorrow, 
  for power, because the working class without power isn&#8217;t worth a thing. 
  Of course we won&#8217;t dissociate ourselves from the economic struggles, because 
  for most workers the economic struggles are the beginning. However, the economic 
  struggles must go hand in hand with a revolutionary development of understanding, 
  of politicization, of awareness on the part of the mass of workers. Only then 
  can we hope for the taking of power, because that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re aiming 
  at. The point is to take the factory, because it&#8217;s the factory that creates 
  value, and it&#8217;s us that should have it, and not them. </p>
