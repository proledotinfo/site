<p class="title">LENINISM AND THE ULTRA-LEFT</p>
<p class="author">by Gilles Dauv&eacute; (1969)</p>
<p class="subtitle">Introduction</p>


<P> The following text is a modified version of a mimeographed text written by 
  a small group of French revolutionaries who had been under the influence of 
  the ultra-left movement and now think it necessary to discuss the fundamental 
  theses of the ultra-left. The original text was submitted to a national convention 
  organised by the French group l.C.O. (Informations Correspondance Ouvrieres), 
  held in Paris in June, 1969. The part devoted to the analysis of the dynamics 
  of capitalism was written later. We decided to translate the second version 
  of our text into English in order to give English-speaking readers an idea of 
  our work and our problems. 
<p>
Our critique of ultra-left ideas will concentrate on two points which are
closely related: <b>the problem of `'organisation,"</b> and <b>the content of
socialism.</b> Our critique must be historical: our aim is not to oppose ideas
with other ideas, but to understand the historical background of the theories
we are examining. This procedure is all the more justified since these theories
constantly refer to a definite past and to other theories produced by a
definite period in the history of the labour movement.<p>

What is the ultra-left? It is both the product and one of the aspects of the
revolutionary movement which followed the first world war and shook capitalist
Europe without destroying it from 1917 to 1921 or 1923. Ultra-left ideas are
rooted in that movement of the twenties, which was the expression of the
struggle of many thousands of revolutionary workers in Europe. That movement
remained a minority in the Communist International and opposed the general line
of the international communist movement. The term itself suggests the character
of the ultra-left. There is the right (the social-patriots, Noske...), the
centre (Kautsky...), the left (Lenin and the Communist International), and the
ultra-left. The ultra-left is primarily an opposition: an opposition within and
against the German Communist Party (K.P.D.), within and - against the Communist
International. It asserts itself through a critique of the prevailing ideas of
the communist movement, i.e., through a critique of <b>Leninism</b>.<p>
The ultra-left was far from being a monolithic movement. Furthermore, its
various components modified their conceptions. For instance, Gorter's open
letter to Lenin expresses a theory of the party which the ultra-left no longer
accepts. On the two main points ("organisation" and the content of socialism)
we shall only study the ideas which the ultra-left has retained throughout its
development. The French group l.C.O. is one of the best examples of a
present-day ultra-left group. 
<p class="subtitle"> A) The Problem of Organization</P>
<p>
Ultra-left ideas are the product of a practical experience (mainly the
workers' struggles in Germany) and of a theoretical critique (the critique of
Leninism). For Lenin, the main revolutionary problem was to forge a
"leadership" capable of leading the workers to victory. When ultra-leftists
tried to give a theoretical explanation of the rise of factory organisations in
Germany, they said the working class does not need a party in order to be
revolutionary. Revolution would be made by the masses organised in workers'
councils and not by a proletariat "led" by professional revolutionaries. The
German Communist Workers' Party (K.A.P.D.), whose activity is expressed
theoretically by Gorter in his "Reply to Lenin," regarded itself as a vanguard
whose task was to enlighten the masses, not to lead them, as in Leninist
theory. Even this conception was rejected by many ultra-leftists, who opposed
the dual existence of the factory organisations <b>and </b>the party:
revolutionaries must not try to organise themselves in a body distinct from the
masses. That discussion led to the creation, in 1920, of the A.A.U.D.-E.
(General Union of German Workers-Unitary Organisation), which reproached the
A.A.U.D. (General Labour Union of Germany) with being controlled by the
K.A.P.D. (German Communist Workers' Party). The majority of the ultra-left
movement adopted the same view as the A.A.U.D.-E. In France, I.C.O.'s present
activity is based on the same principle: any revolutionary organisation
coexisting with the organs created by the workers themselves, and trying to
elabourate a coherent theory and political line, must in the end attempt to
lead the workers. Therefore revolutionaries do not organise themselves outside
the organs "spontaneously" created by the workers: they merely exchange and
circulate information and establish contacts with other revolutionaries; they
never try to define a general theory or strategy.<p>
To understand this conception, we must go back to Leninism. The Leninist theory
of the party is based on a distinction which can be found in all the great
socialist thinkers of the period: "labour movement" and "socialism"
(revolutionary ideas, the doctrine, Scientific Socialism, Marxism, etc. - it
can be given many different names) are two things which are fundamentally
different and <b>separate</b>. There are workers and their daily struggles on
the one hand, and there are the revolutionaries on the other. Lenin proceeds to
state that revolutionary ideas must be "introduced" into the working class. The
labour movement and the revolutionary movement are severed from each other:
they must be united through the leadership of the revolutionaries over the
workers. Therefore revolutionaries must be organised and must act on the
working class "from the outside." Lenin's analysis, situating the
revolutionaries outside the labour movement, seems to be based on fact: it
appears that revolutionaries live in a totally different world from that of
workers. Yet Lenin does not see that this is an illusion. Marx's analysis and
his scientific socialism as a whole are not the product of "bourgeois
intellectuals," but of the class struggle on all its levels under capitalism.
"Socialism" is the expression of the struggle of the proletariat. It was
elabourated by "bourgeois intellectuals" (and by highly educated workers: J.
Dietzgen) because only revolutionaries coming from the bourgeoisie were able to
elabourate it, but it was the product of the class struggle.<p>
The revolutionary movement, the dynamic that leads toward communism, is a
result of capitalism. Let us examine Marx's conception of the party. The word,

<b>party</b>, appears frequently in Marx's writings. We must make a
,distinction between Marx's principles on this question and his analyses of
many aspects of the labour movement of his time. Many of those analyses were
wrong (for example his view of the future of trade unionism). Moreover we
cannot find a text where Marx summed up his ideas on the party, but only a
number of scattered remarks and comments. Yet we believe that a general point
of view emerges from all these texts. Capitalist society itself produces a
communist party, which is nothing more than the organisation of the
<b>objective</b> movement (this implies that Kautsky's and Lenin's conception
of a "socialist consciousness" which must be "brought" to the workers is
meaningless) that pushes society toward communism (we shall soon deal with what
communism is, or at least with what it is not). The struggle of the proletariat
develops under various forms. Lenin saw a reformist proletariat and said that
something had to be done ("socialist consciousness" had to be introduced) in
order to turn it into a revolutionary proletariat. Thus Lenin showed that he
totally misunderstood class struggle. In a non-revolutionary period the
proletariat cannot change capitalist production relations. It therefore tries
to change capitalist distribution relations through its demand for higher
wages. Of course the workers do not "know" that they are changing the
distribution relations when they ask for higher wages. Yet they do try,
"unconsciously," to act upon the capitalist system. Kautsky and Lenin do not
see <b>the process</b>, the revolutionary movement created by capitalism; they
only see <b>one of its aspects</b> Kautsky's and Lenin's theory of class
consciousness breaks up a process and considers only one of its transitory
moments: for them the proletariat "by its own resources alone" can only be
reformist, whereas the revolutionaries stand outside of the labour movement. In
actual fact the revolutionaries and their ideas and theories originate in the
workers' struggles.<p>
In a non-revolutionary period, revolutionary workers, isolated in their
factories, do their best to expose the real nature of capitalism and the
institutions which support it (unions, "workers"' parties). They usually do
this with little success, which is quite normal. And there are revolutionaries
(workers and non-workers) who read and write, who do their best to provide a
critique of the whole system. They usually do this with little success, which
is also quite normal. This division is produced by capitalism: one of the
characteristics of capitalist society is the division between manual and
intellectual work. This division exists in all the spheres of our society; it
also exists in the revolutionary movement. It would be idealistic to expect the
revolutionary movement to be "pure," as if it were not a product of our
society. Inevitably the revolutionary movement under capitalism, that is
communism, bears the stigma of capitalism.<p>
Only the complete success of revolution can destroy this division. Until then
we must fight against it; it characterises our movement as much as it
characterises the rest of our society. It is inevitable that numerous
revolutionaries are not greatly inclined to reading and are not interested in
theory. This is a fact, a transitory fact. But "revolutionary workers" and
"revolutionary theoreticians" are two aspects of the same process. It is wrong
to say that the "theoreticians" must lead the "workers." But it is equally
wrong to say, as l.C.O. says, that collectively organised theory is dangerous
because it will result in leadership over the workers. I.C.O. merely takes a
position symmetrical to Lenin's. The revolutionary process is an organic
process, and although its components may be separate from each other for a
certain time, the emergence of any revolutionary (or even pseudo-revolutionary)
situation shows the profound unity of the various elements of the revolutionary
movement.<p>
What happened in May, 1968, in the worker-student action committees at the
Censier centre in Paris? Some (ultra-left) communists, who before these events
had devoted most of their revolutionary activity to theory, worked with a
minority of revolutionary workers. Before May, 1968 (and since then), they were
no more separate from the workers than every worker is separate from other
workers in a "normal," non-revolutionary situation in capitalist society. Marx
was not separate from the workers when he was writing <b>Capital</b>, nor when
he was working in the Communist League or the International. When he worked in
these organisations he felt neither the need (as Lenin), nor the fear (as
l.C.O.), to become the leader of the workers.<p>

We think that Marx's notion of the party has at least one merit. Marx's
conception of <b>the party as a historical product of capitalist society taking
different forms according to the stage and the evolution of that society</b>
enables us to go beyond the dilemma: need of the party/fear of the party. The
communist party is the spontaneous (i.e., totally determined by social
evolution) organisation of the revolutionary movement created by capitalism.
The party is a spontaneous offspring, born on the historical soil of modern
society. Both the will and the fear to "create" the party are illusions. It
does not need to be created or not created: it is a mere historical product.
Therefore revolutionaries have no need either to build it or fear to build
it.<p>
Lenin had a theory of the party. Marx had another theory of the party, which
was quite different from Lenin's. Lenin's theory was an element in the defeat
of the Russian revolution. The ultra-left rejected <b>all</b> theories of the
party as dangerous and counter-revolutionary. Yet Lenin's theory was not at the
root of the defeat of the Russian revolution. Lenin's theory only prevailed
because the Russian revolution failed for various reasons (mainly because of
the absence of revolution in the West). One must not discard all theories of
the party because one of them (Lenin's) was a counter-revolutionary instrument.
Unfortunately, the ultra-left merely adopted a conception which is the exact
opposite of Lenin's. Lenin had wanted to build a party; the ultra-left refused
to build one. The ultra-left thus gave a different answer to the same wrong
question: for or against the construction of the party. The ultra-left remained
on the same ground as Lenin. We, on the contrary, do not want merely to reverse
Lenin's view; we want to abandon it altogether.
<p> Modern Leninist groups (Trotskyist groups, for instance) try to organise the 
  workers. Modern ultra-left groups (I.C.O., for instance) only circulate information 
  without trying to adopt a collective position on a problem. As opposed to this, 
  we believe it necessary to formulate a theoretical critique of present society. 
  Such a critique implies collective work. We also think that any permanent group 
  of revolutionary workers must try to find a theoretical basis for its action. 
  <b>Theoretical clarification</b> is an element of, and a necessary condition 
  for, <b>practical unification</b>.
<P class="subtitle"> B) The Content of Socialism
<p>
The Russian revolution died because it had to develop capitalism in
Russia. To create an efficient body of managers became its motto. The
ultra-left quickly concluded that bureaucratic management could not be
socialism and they advocated workers' management. A coherent ultra-left theory
was created, with workers' councils at its centre: the councils act as the
fighting organs of the workers under capitalism and as the instruments of
workers' management under socialism. Thus the councils play the same central
role in the ultra-left theory as the party in the Leninist theory.
<p> The theory of workers' management analyses capitalism in terms of its management. 
  But is capitalism first of all a mode of management? The revolutionary analysis 
  of capitalism started by Marx does not lay the stress on the question: who manages 
  capital? On the contrary: Marx describes both capitalists and workers as mere 
  functions of capital: "the capitalist as such is only a function of capital, 
  the labourer a function of labour power.'' The Russian leaders do not "lead" 
  the economy; they are led by it, and the entire development of the Russian economy 
  obeys the objective laws of capitalist accumulation. In other words, the manager 
  is at the service of definite and compelling production relations. <b>Capitalism 
  is not a mode of MANAGEMENT but a mode of PRODUCTION based on given PRODUCTION 
  RELATIONS</b>. Revolution must aim at these relations; we will try to analyse 
  them briefly. The revolutionary analysis of capitalism emphasises the role of 
  <b>capital</b>, whose objective laws are obeyed by the "managers" of the economy, 
  both in Russia and in America. 
<p class="subtitle"> C) The Law of Value
</P>
<p> Capitalism is based on exchange: it first presents itself as "an immense accumulation 
  of commodities." But though it could not exist without exchange, capitalism 
  is not merely the production of commodities; it grows and develops even by fighting 
  against simple commodity production. Capital is fundamentally based on a particular 
  type of exchange, the exchange between living labour and stored labour. The 
  difference between Marx and the classical economists lies primarily in his creation 
  of the concept of <b>labour power</b>: this concept reveals the secret of surplus-value, 
  since it differentiates between necessary-labour and surplus labour.
<p> How do commodities confront each other? By what mechanism can one determine 
  that x quantity of A has the same value as y quantity of B? Marx does not try 
  to find the explanation for xA = yB in the concrete nature of A and B, in their 
  respective qualities, but in a quantitative relation: A and B can only be exchanged 
  in the proportion xA = yB because they both contain a quantity of "something 
  common" to both of them. If we abstract the concrete and useful nature of A 
  and B, they retain only one thing in common: they are both "products of labour." 
  A and B are exchanged in proportions determined by the respective quantities 
  of labour crystallised in them. The quantities of labour are measured by their 
  duration. The concept of <b>socially necessary labour time</b>, developed by 
  further analysis, is an abstraction: one cannot calculate what an hour of socially 
  necessary labour represents in a given society. But the distinction between 
  abstract and concrete labour allows Marx to understand the mechanism of exchange 
  and to analyse a particular form of exchange: the wage system.
<p> "The best points in my book are: 1 ) the <b>two-fold character of labour</b>, 
  according to whether it is expressed in use value or exchange value. (<b>All</b> 
  understanding of the facts depends upon this.) It is emphasised immediately, 
  in the <b>first</b> chapter. ,, 
<p>
The buying and selling of all commodities, including the labour force, obeys
what Marx calls the law of value. At first that law seems to be quite simple:
commodities are exchanged according to their value, which is determined by the
labour time socially necessary for their production. Yet in the third volume of
<b>Capital</b> Marx asserts that:
<p> "The exchange of commodities at their values, or approximately at their values, 
  requires a much lower stage than their exchange at their prices of production, 
  which requires a definite level of capitalist development."
<p>
In fact, the law of value is analysed as both the cause and the consequence of
a long and contradictory evolution, which we will try to summarise.
<p> Exchange appears in primitive societies only when the degree of productivity 
  allows people to produce more than they need to satisfy their own needs. The 
  division of labour appears, as well as money, which "serves as a universal measure 
  of value": exchange-value thus seems to acquire some sort of autonomy, embodied 
  by the money-lender and the merchant, who earn their living out of the circulation 
  of money, and in fact derive their living from the surplus-labour of productive 
  working people. Money implies <b>prices</b>: price is the monetary form of value, 
  although it does not coincide with value. The relation between supply and demand 
  interferes at three levels: there is competition 1) among the sellers, 2) among 
  the buyers, 3) between the sellers and the buyers. The relation between supply 
  and demand causes a fall or a rise of price below or above the value of the 
  commodity. But in a given period of time, and within the limits of these oscillations, 
  the value of a commodity is not determined by competition, but by its cost of 
  production. The value of the commodity is determined by the socially necessary 
  labour time; its price, by the relation between supply and demand. The law of 
  value "is none other than that which, within the fluctuations of trade periods, 
  necessarily <b>levels out</b> the price of a commodity to its <b>cost of production</b>.'
<p>

So far we have only considered the case of simple commodity production.
Capitalism develops the law of value and makes the relation of price to value
extremely complex. Primitive capitalist accumulation is based on:<p>
a)	the transformation of labour-power into a commodity, which implies that
labour-power freely appears on the market as an element distinct from the
others in the labour process;<p>
b)	the accumulation of a considerable capital which is to be invested in
industry.<p>
The large sums gathered under the mercantile system from the 15th to the 17th
centuries were used for this purpose. In a totally different situation, one of
the aims of the destruction of the kulaks and NEPmen which started in 1928, in
Russia, was to allow the State to seize a considerable stock of values in order
to invest them in industry. In both cases, the development of commercial
capital was the step that had to precede a great industrial boom. Produced by
the development of exchange, capital itself spreads exchange throughout the
planet and thereby modifies, not the law of value, but the way it manifests
itself: the forms of value are transformed in order to maintain and fully
develop the content of the law. The distinction price/value existed before
capitalism, but industrial capitalism modifies it. We know that price
oscillates around value according to the fluctuation of supply and demand. But
capitalist society creates a dynamic movement in the relation price/value.
<p> "What will be the consequence of the rising price of a commodity? A mass of 
  capital will be thrown into that flourishing branch of industry and this influx 
  of capital into the domain of the favoured industry will continue until it yields 
  the ordinary profits or, rather, until the price of its products, through overproduction, 
  sinks below the cost of production. " 
<p>
Marx analyses this problem more systematically in the third volume of
<b>Capital</b>:
<p> "Owing to the different organic compositions of capitals invested in different 
  lines of production, and, hence, owing to the circumstance that - depending 
  on the different percentage which the variable part makes up in a total capital 
  of a given magnitude-capitals of equal magnitude put into motion very different 
  quantities of labour, they also appropriate very different quantities of surplus-labour 
  or produce very different quantities of surplus-value. Accordingly, the rates 
  of profit prevailing in the various branches of production are originally very 
  different. These different rates of profit are equalised by competition to a 
  single general rate of profit, which is the average of all these different rates 
  of profit. The profit accruing in accordance with this general rate of profit 
  to any capital of a given magnitude, whatever its organic composition, is called 
  the average profit. The price of a commodity, which is equal to its cost-price 
  plus the share of the annual average profit on the total capital invested (not 
  merely consumed) in its production that falls to it in accordance with the conditions 
  of turnover, is called its price of production." 
<p> This process is the equalisation of the rate of profit: the development of 
  exchange gives birth to a market price, which oscillates with the fluctuations 
  of competition within the limits we have described. The movement of market prices 
  seems to negate the law of value. But the circulation of capital, its never 
  ending search for branches where the cost of production is as low as possible, 
  tends to make all rates of profit uniform. Capitalism tends to create what Marx 
  called a "capitalist communism" where all surplus-value is redistributed. A 
  price of production is created as a sort of average of the oscillations of the 
  market prices of each commodity.
<p> "The price thus equalised, which divides up the social surplus value equally 
  among the individual capitals in proportion to their sizes, is the <b>price 
  of production</b> of commodities, the centre around which the oscillation of 
  the market prices moves." 
<p>
Like market prices, the price of production seems to be a new negation of the
law of value, since the price of commodities is composed of their cost of
production <b>plus </b>the average profit:
<p> "It would seem, therefore, that here the theory of value is incompatible with 
  the actual process, incompatible with the real phenomena of production..." 
<p>

We must nevertheless think of society as a whole and consider the entire
capitalist process of production.
<p> "The capital invested in some spheres of production has a mean, or average, 
  composition, that is, it has the same, or almost the same composition as the 
  average social capital." 
<p>
In other sectors, it does not coincide with value; a phenomenon of
"compensation" appears.
<p> "The assumption that the commodities of the various spheres of production 
  are sold at their value merely implies, of course, that their value is the centre 
  of gravity around which their prices fluctuate, and their continual rises and 
  drops tend to equalise. There is also the <b>market-value</b>... to be distinguished 
  from the individual value of particular commodities produced by different producers. 
  The individual value of some of these commodities will be below their market-value 
  (that is, less labour-time is required for their production than expressed in 
  the market-value) while that of others will exceed the market-value." 
<p>
The merit of Marx's analysis is that he tries to show a direct link between the
supply-demand relation and the question of labour time (as he did by
distinguishing between value and price).
<p> "For a commodity to be sold at its market-value, i.e., proportionally to the 
  necessary social labour contained in it, the total quantity of social labour 
  used in producing the total mass of this commodity must correspond to the quantity 
  of the social want for it, i.e., the effective social want. Competition, the 
  fluctuations of market-prices which correspond to the fluctuations of demand 
  and supply, tend continually to reduce to this scale the total quantity of labour 
  devoted to each kind of commodity.''.
<p> There is no contradiction between value, on the one hand, and the cost of 
  production <b>plus</b> the average profit on the other. The operation of capitalism, 
  by transforming surplus-value into profit, itself establishes the proportion 
  of the value of a commodity which represents the cost of production and the 
  portion which represents the average profit. The average profit, though it appears 
  as "something outside,'' is merely the product of the total capital invested 
  by society.
<p> "It is evident that from the point of view of the total social capital the 
  value of the commodities produced by it (or, expressed in money, their price) 
  = value of constant capital + value of variable capital + surplus-value." 
<p> "It is evident that the average profit can be nothing but the total mass of 
  surplus-values allotted to the various quantities of capital proportionally 
  to their magnitudes in the different spheres of production.".
<p>
By its double negation of the law of value through the market price and the
price of production, capitalism merely reinforces and extends the dominion of
the law of value. Value now acquires a "modified" form: but the transformation
of values into prices of production, and the creation of a market value
distinct from the individual value, realise the law while generalising it.
<p> "The commodities - taken <b>en masse</b> and on a social scale - are sold 
  at <b>their values</b>." 
<p>
Marx sums up the process by which <b>the law of value asserts itself through
its double negation</b>:
<p> "What competition, first in a single sphere, achieves is a single market-value 
  and market-price derived from the various individual values of commodities. 
  And it is competition of capitals in different spheres, which first brings out 
  the price of production equalising the rates of profit in the different spheres. 
  The latter process requires a higher development of capitalist production than 
  the previous one."
<p> "...This always resolves itself to one commodity receiving too little of the 
  surplus-value while another receives too much, so that the deviations from the 
  value which are embodied in the prices of production compensate one another. 
  Under capitalist production, the general law acts as the prevailing tendency 
  only in a very complicated and approximate manner, as a never ascertainable 
  average of ceaseless fluctuations." 
<p>

These developments elucidate the historical cycle of exchange which runs its
course through capitalism. "Popular" Marxism has turned the law of value into a
mere regulating mechanism, disregarding what was interesting in Marx's study:
<b>the attempt to discover the dynamics of capitalism</b>. The very movement of
the law of value makes labour time one of the elements of this dynamics.
<p> "I demonstrate that the average price of commodities can never be equal to 
  its value precisely because the value of the commodity is determined by its 
  labour time." 
<p> Labour time, in fact, determines the entire social organisation of production 
  and distribution. It regulates the proportions in which the productive forces 
  are used for specific purposes at specific places. The law of value "asserts 
  itself as it determines the necessary proportions of social labour, not in the 
  general sense which applies to all societies, but only in the sense required 
  by capitalist society; in other words, it establishes a proportional distribution 
  of the whole social labour according to the specific needs of capitalist Production" 
<p> This is one of the reasons why capital will not be invested in a factory in 
  India even though the production of that factory may be necessary to the survival 
  of the population. Capital always goes where it can multiply quickly. The regulation 
  by labour time compels capitalist society to develop a given production only 
  where the labour time socially necessary for this production is <b>at most</b> 
  equal to the average labour time. " The form in which this proportional distribution 
  of labour asserts itself, in a state of society where the interconnection of 
  social labour is manifested in the <b>private exchange</b> of the individual 
  products of labour, is precisely the <b>exchange value</b> of these products." 
<p> Such is the logic of capital: exchange-value determined by average labour 
  time. Marx wondered if this movement itself produced the irrationality of the 
  capitalist system. We will only deal with <b>one aspect</b> of the contradiction, 
  by studying Marx's analysis of labour time. 
<p class="subtitle">D) The Contradiction of Labour Time
<p>
We mentioned the central role played by surplus labour in the production
of surplus value. Marx emphasised the origin, the function and the limit of
surplus labour. 
<p> ". . .<b>Only when a certain degree of productivity has already been reached 
  - so that a part of production time is sufficient for immediate production - 
  can an increasingly large part be applied to the production of the means of 
  production</b>. This requires that society be able to wait; that a large part 
  of the wealth already created can be withdrawn both from immediate consumption 
  and from production for immediate consumption, in order to employ this part 
  for labour which is <b>not immediately productive</b> (within the material production 
  process itself)." 
<p>

Wage labour is the means for developing the productive forces.
<p> "Real economy - saving - consists of the saving of labour time (minimum (and 
  minimisation) of production costs); but this saving [is] identical with development 
  of the productive force." 
<p>
Wage labour makes possible the production of surplus value through the
appropriation of surplus labour by capital. In that sense the miserable
condition which is the lot of the worker is a historical necessity. The worker
must be compelled to furnish surplus labour. This is how the productive forces
develop and increase the share of surplus labour in the working day:
<p> Capital creates "<b>a large quantity of disposable time</b>. . . (i.e. room 
  for the development of the individuals' full productive forces, hence those 
  of society also)." 
<p> The contradictory or "antithetical existence". of surplus labour is quite 
  clear:
<p>

- it creates the "wealth of nations,"<p>
- it brings nothing but misery to the workers who furnish it.
<p> This contradiction has an objective basis: the need for the growth of the 
  productive forces. But when that growth reaches a fantastically high level, 
  surplus labour becomes so important in relation to necessary labour that it 
  becomes possible to modify the relation of the worker to surplus labour through 
  the destruction of the contradictory basis of surplus labour. 
<p> Capital "is thus, despite itself, instrumental in creating the means of social 
  disposable time, in order to reduce labour time for the whole society to a diminishing 
  minimum, and thus to free everyone's time for their own development.".
<p>
In communism, the excess of time in relation to necessary labour time will lose
the character of surplus labour which the historical limits of the productive
forces had bestowed on it under capitalism. Disposable time will cease to be
based on the poverty of labour. There will be no need to use misery to create
wealth. When the relation between necessary labour and surplus labour is
overthrown by the rise of the productive forces, the excess of time beyond
labour needed for material existence will lose its transitory form of surplus
labour.
<p> "Free time - which is both idle time and time for higher activity - has naturally 
  transformed its possessor into a different subject, and he then enters into 
  the direct production process as this different subject.".
<p>
The economy of labour time is an absolute necessity for the development of
mankind. It lays the foundation for the possibility of capitalism and, at a
higher stage, of communism. <b>The same movement</b> develops capitalism and
makes communism both necessary and possible.
<p> The law of value and measurement by average labour time are involved in the 
  same process. The law of value expresses the limit of capitalism and plays a 
  necessary part. As long as the productive forces are not yet highly developed 
  and immediate labour remains the essential factor of production, measurement 
  by average labour time is an absolute necessity. But with the development of 
  capital, especially of fixed capital, "the creation of real wealth comes to 
  depend less on labour time and on the amount of labour employed than on the 
  power of the agencies set in motion during labour time, whose `powerful effectiveness' 
  is itself in turn out of all proportion to the direct labour time spent on their 
  production, but depends rather on the general state of science and on the progress 
  of technology, or the application of this science to production." 
<p>
The misery of the proletariat has been the condition for a considerable growth
of fixed capital, in which all the scientific and technical knowledge of
mankind is "fixed." Automation, the effects of which we are now beginning to
see, is but one stage in this development. Yet capital continues to regulate
production through the measurement of average labour time.
<p> "Capital itself is the moving contradiction, [in] that it presses to reduce 
  labour time to a minimum, while it posits labour time, on the other side, as 
  sole measure and source of wealth. Hence it diminishes labour time in the necessary 
  form so as to increase it in the superfluous form." 
<p>
What we said about the "contradictory existence" of surplus labour must be
connected with the question of labour time. The well known contradiction
productive forces/production relations cannot be understood if one does not see
the link between the following oppositions:<p>
a) contradiction between the function of average labour time as a regulator of
"under-developed" productive forces, and the growth of productive forces which
<b>tends</b> to destroy the necessity of such a function.<p>
b) contradiction between the necessity of developing to a maximum the surplus
labour of the worker in order to produce as much surplus value as possible, and
the very growth of surplus labour which makes its suppression possible. 
<p> The contradictory relation productive forces/production relations can only 
  be understood as a concept to build, as a synthesis of several questions at 
  different levels: problems of credit, of rent. . . The contradiction of labour 
  time and the dynamics of this contradiction are but one aspect of the opposition 
  between the growth of productive capacities and the social relations of capitalist 
  society.
<p>
Marx attempted to give a synthesis of points a) and b):
<p> "As soon as labour in the direct form has ceased to be the great well-spring 
  of wealth, labour time ceases and must cease to be its measure, and hence exchange 
  value [must cease to be the measure] of use value. The <b>surplus labour of 
  the mass</b> has ceased to be the condition for the development of general wealth, 
  just as the <b>non-labour of the few</b>, for the development of the general 
  powers of the human head."
<p>
"Human liberation," prophesied by all utopian thinkers (past and present), is
then possible:
<p> "With that, production based on exchange value breaks down. . . . The free 
  development of individualities, and hence not the reduction of necessary labour 
  time so as to posit surplus labour, but rather the general reduction of the 
  necessary labour of society to a minimum, which then corresponds to the artistic, 
  scientific etc. development of the individuals in the time set free, and with 
  the means created, for all of them."
<p>
What one might call the dialectics of labour time is also interesting as
regards the subject of communist society and the necessary transition which
leads to it. If one studies the question of labour time and measure as we have
tried to, one will be able to understand assertions by Marx which might
otherwise seem somewhat paradoxical or even contradictory.
<p> "Every child knows that a nation which ceased to work, I will not say for 
  a year, but even for a few weeks, would perish. Every child knows, too, that 
  the masses of products corresponding to the different needs require different 
  and quantitatively determined masses of the total labour of society. That this 
  necessity of the distribution of social labour in definite proportions cannot 
  possibly be done away with by a particular form of social production but can 
  only change the mode of its appearance, is self evident. No natural laws can 
  be done away with. What can change in historically different circumstances is 
  only the form in which these laws assert themselves."
<p> We have seen that the law of value organises what Bukharin calls "the socially 
  indispensable proportions between the various branches of production," and creates 
  "the state of equilibrium" of society, with average labour time as the fundamental 
  regulator.
<p>
Yet we read in a letter written by Marx to Engels on January 8, 1868:
<p> "<b>No form</b> of society can prevent the working time at the disposal of 
  society from regulating production one way or another. So long, however, as 
  this regulation is accomplished not by the direct and conscious control of society 
  over its working time - which is possible only with common ownership - but by 
  the movement of commodity prices, things remain as you have already quite aptly 
  described them in the Deutsch-Franz&ouml;sische Jahrb&uuml;cher. . ." 
<p> There is in fact no incoherence in Marx's thought at this level. This letter 
  has been interpreted in all possible ways in the debate which drew a fundamental 
  opposition between Bukharin and Preobrazhensky, but the real content of Marx's 
  ideas has not been presented in its true light. One thing is certain: Marx opposes 
  regulation by <b>socially necessary</b> labour time to regulation by <b>available 
  </b>time. Of course these are not two methods which could be used or rejected, 
  but two historical objective processes involving all social relations. Many 
  people know the pages from the <b>Critique of the Gotha Programme</b> where 
  Marx explains that "within the co-operative society based on common ownership 
  of the means of production, the producers do not exchange their products; just 
  as little does the labour employed on the products appear here as <b>the value</b> 
  of these products, as a material quality possessed by them, since now, in contrast 
  to capitalist society, individual labour no longer exists in an indirect fashion 
  but directly as a component part of the total labour." 
<p>
The following passage from the second volume of Capital is less frequently
quoted:
<p> "If we conceive society as being not capitalistic but communistic, there will 
  be no money-capital at all in the first place, nor the disguises cloaking the 
  transactions arising on account of it. The question then comes down to the need 
  of society to calculate beforehand how much labour, means of production, and 
  means of subsistence it can invest, without detriment, in such lines of business 
  as for instance the building of railways, which do not furnish any means of 
  production or subsistence, nor produce any useful effect for a long time, a 
  year or more, while they extract labour, means of production and means of subsistence 
  from the total annual production. In capitalist society however where social 
  reason always asserts itself only <b>post festum</b> great disturbances may 
  and must constantly occur. On the one hand pressure is brought to bear on the 
  money-market, while on the other, an easy money-market calls such enterprises 
  into being <b>en masse</b>, thus creating the very circumstances which later 
  give rise to pressure on the money-market." 
<p>

Marx states that in communist society there will be a high level of development
of the productive forces. This level will make it possible for mankind not to
measure with necessary labour time. Yet something will be needed to study the
relative importance given to one or another branch. The calculation will not be
made according to the social cost of the product, but by confronting the
various needs. "To everybody according to his needs," in Marx's view, does not
mean that "everything" will exist "in abundance"; the notion of absolute
"abundance" is itself an ideological notion and not a scientific concept There
will have to be some sort of calculation and choice, not on the basis of
exchange value, but on the basis of use value, of the <b>social utility of the
considered product</b>. (Thereby the problem of "undeveloped countries" will be
seen and treated in a new way.) Marx was quite clear about this in <b>The
Poverty of Philosophy</b>:
<p> "In a future society, in which class antagonism will have ceased, in which 
  there will no longer be any classes, use will no longer be determined by the 
  <b>minimum </b>time of production; but the time of production devoted to different 
  articles will be determined by the degree of their social utility." 
<p> Thus the text on the passage from the "realm of necessity" to the "realm of 
  freedom" is elucidated. Freedom is regarded as a <b>relation </b>where man, 
  mastering the process of production of material life, will at last be able to 
  adapt his aspirations to the level reached by the development of the productive 
  forces. The growth of social wealth and the development of every individuality 
  coincide.
<p> "For real wealth is the developed productive power of all individuals. The 
  measure of wealth is then not any longer, in any way, labour time, but rather 
  disposable time."
<p> Thus Marx is quite right to describe time as the dimension of human liberation.
<p>
Furthermore, it is clear that the dynamics analysed by Marx excludes the
hypothesis of any <b>gradual</b> way to communism through the progressive
destruction of the law of value. On the contrary, the law of value keeps
asserting itself violently until the overthrow of capitalism: the law of value
never ceases destroying itself - only to reappear at a higher level. We have
seen that the movement which gave birth to it tends to destroy its necessity.
But it never ceases to exist and to regulate the functioning of the system. A
revolution is therefore necessary. But at the same time one realises how
revolution is possible. The driving force of revolution, and the sign of the
strength of the proletariat, are not to be found in any "consciousness" or in
the pure "spontaneity" of the workers (as if they were "free"), but in the
growth of productive forces, which includes social struggles.<p>
The contradictory nature of labour time also underlies the two-fold character
of labour itself, the source of the dialectic: use-value/exchange-value. Marx's
analysis tries to give a definition of capital, and we have only attempted to
present <b>one aspect</b> of his work. Marx's analysis is not the only thing
revolutionaries must study, but we do think it necessary to be as familiar with
it as possible. This is why we have concentrated on Marx. We have only tried to
state a question, and we will take care not to imitate the thinker who,
according to Marx, solved problems only by simplifying them.<p>
The theory of the management of society through workers' councils does not take
the dynamics of capitalism into account. It retains all the categories and
characteristics of capitalism: wage-labour, law of value, exchange. The sort of
socialism it proposes is nothing other than capitalism - democratically managed
by the workers. If this were put into practice there would be two
possibilities: either the workers' councils would try not to function as in
capitalist enterprises, which would be impossible since capitalist production
relations would still exist. In this case the workers' councils would be
destroyed by counter-revolution. Production relations are not man-to-man
relations, but the combination of the various elements of the process of
labour. The "human" relation leaders/led is only a secondary form of the
fundamental relation between wage-labour and capital. Or the workers' councils
would consent to functioning as capitalist enterprises. In this case the system
of councils would not survive; it would become an illusion, one of the numerous
forms of association between Capital and Labour. "Elected" managers would soon
become identical to traditional capitalists: the function of capitalist, says
Marx, tends to separate from the function of worker. Workers' management would
result in capitalism; in other words, capitalism would not have been
destroyed.<p>

The Bolshevik bureaucracy took the economy under its control. The ultra-left
wants the masses to do this. The ultra-left remains on the same ground as
Leninism: it once again gives a different answer to the same question (the
management of the economy). We want to replace that question with a different
one (the destruction of that economy, which is capitalist). Socialism is not
the management, however "democratic" it may be, of capital, but its complete
destruction. 
<p class="subtitle">E) The Historical Limit of the Ultra-Left
<p>
Our examination of the problem of "organisation" and of the content of
socialism has led us to affirm the existence of a revolutionary dynamic under
capitalism. Produced by capitalism, the revolutionary movement assumes new
forms in a new situation. Socialism is not merely the management of society by
the workers, but the termination of the historical cycle of capital by the
proletariat. The proletariat does not only seize the world; it also concludes
the movement of capitalism and exchange. This is what distinguishes Marx from
all utopian and reformist thinkers; socialism is produced by the objective
dynamics which created capital and spread it all over the planet. Marx insists
on the <b>content</b> of the movement. Lenin and the ultra-left insisted on its
forms: form of organisation, form of management of society, while they forgot
the content of the revolutionary movement. This, too, was a historical product.
The situation of the period, and above all the limited development of
productive forces, prevented revolutionary struggles from having a
<b>communist</b> content (in the sense we have defined). It imposed upon the
revolutionaries forms which could not be communist, radical. The time for the
destruction of capitalism had not yet come.<p>

Leninism expressed the impossibility of revolution in his time. Marx's ideas on
the party were abandoned. It was the time of the large reformist organisations,
then of the communist parties (which quickly or immediately sank into another
form of reformism). The revolutionary movement was not strong enough.
Everywhere, in Germany, in Italy, in France, in Great Britain, the beginning of
the twenties was marked by the control of the masses by "workers'" leaders.
Reacting against this situation, ultra-leftists were driven to the point where
they feared to become the new bureaucrats. Instead of understanding the
Leninist parties as a product of proletarian defeat, they refused any party,
and like Lenin let the Marxist conception of the party remain in oblivion. As
for the content of socialism, all social movements from the Russian revolution
to the Spanish revolution tried to administer capitalism and not to overthrow
it. In such conditions the ultra-left <b>could not</b> make a profound critique
of Leninism. They could only take the opposite view, and oppose other
<b>forms</b> to Leninism, without seeing the <b>content</b> of revolution. This
was all the more natural as that content did not clearly appear. (We must
nevertheless remember that the ultra-left provided a remarkable critique of
some aspects of capitalism - unionism and "workers'" parties).<p>
These are the reasons why the ultra-left movement only replaced the Leninist
fetishism of the party and class-consciousness with the fetishism of workers'
councils. We daresay that the ultra-left has not gone beyond Leninism. Its
conceptions were useful and necessary, but only in a transitory phase. Now
Leninism approaches its end because the counter-revolution which produced it
also approaches its end (though no one knows when it will be over, opening the
way for a revolutionary period). Consequently, ultra-left ideas, which are no
more than the counterpart of Leninism, must and can be gone beyond. The
critique of both Leninism and ultra-leftism is now possible because the
development of capitalism gives us an idea of the real content of the
revolutionary movement, itself developed by capital.<p>
By holding on to the ultra-left ideas we presented (fear of creating the party,
and workers' management), we would turn them into mere ideology. When these
ideas first appeared around 1920, they expressed a real revolutionary struggle,
and even their "mistakes" played a positive and progressive role in the
struggles against social democracy and Leninism. Their limits were the
expression of the activity of thousands of revolutionary workers. But things
have changed a great deal since 1920. A new revolutionary workers' minority is
in a <b>slow</b> process of formation, as was revealed by the 1968 events in
France, and by other struggles in several countries. The situation today is
different. Capitalism has developed on a world-wide scale: 1969 is totally
different from 1919. The revolutionary situation which may arise in a few (how
many?) years may not be the beginning of the end for the capitalist system, but
its content must be quite different from that of 1920. Therefore our first task
is to understand the ideas we have inherited from the past and to study the
revolutionary movement of our own society.<p>

In a revolutionary period, the revolutionary fights alongside the proletarian
without any theoretical or sociological problem. The revolutionary movement
gets unified. <b>Theoretical coherence</b> is a permanent objective of the
revolutionaries, as it always hastens the <b>practical co-ordination</b> of
revolutionary efforts. Revolutionaries never hesitate to act collectively in
order to propagate their critique of the existing society.<p>
They do not try to tell the workers what to do; but they do not refrain from
intervening under the pretext that "the workers must decide for themselves."
For, on the one hand, the workers only decide to do what the general situation
compels them to do; and on the other, the revolutionary movement is an organic
structure of which theory is an inseparable and indispensable element.
Communists represent and defend the general interests of the movement. In all
situations, they do not hesitate to express the whole meaning of what is going
on, and to make practical proposals. If the expression is right and the
proposal appropriate, they are parts of the struggle of the proletariat and
contribute to build the "party" of the communist revolution. <p>
