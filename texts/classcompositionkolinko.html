<p class="title">CLASS COMPOSITION</p>
<p class="author">by Kolinko (2001)</p>
<p><b>Introduction</b><br>
  Class composition is a central notion in our search for the possibility of revolution. 
  We are looking for a force that is able to change society from the bottom up. 
  It is correct, however general, to say that only the exploited are able to overthrow 
  exploitation, but how does this process of liberation actually take place? The 
  perception of the Marxist-Leninists is different from our experiences: the "working 
  class" is neither a united object nor do we see the possibility that it just 
  needs a political party to overcome the class divisions and give a revolutionary 
  direction to workers' struggles. The analysis of class composition can help 
  us understand what is determining workers' struggles, how they can turn into 
  a class movement and how we can play an active part in this process. <br>
  The work-shop on class composition can therefore be the starting-point for a 
  deeper discussion about our "role as revolutionaries" and our political strategies: 
  where is a deeper coherence of the "workers' net" of CRO in Bologna, the "workers' 
  inquiry" of Kolinko in the Ruhr Area, the interventions in Brighton, the newspaper 
  project of Folkmakt etc.? About which questions do we have different political 
  assessments and what possibilities for further co-operation exist? <br>
  We want to start with some short points on the relationship between political 
  practice and the notion of class. <br>
  <br>
  <b>1. The notion of the "role of revolutionaries" has its basis in a specific 
  notion of class and in a specific relation to class</b><br>
  In the discussion about the "role of revolutionaries" different political currents 
  (Leninism, Syndicalism, Council-Communism etc.) are usually just "compared" 
  to each other. We have to analyse how different notions of the role of revolutionaries 
  and their organisation derives from different comprehensions of class and from 
  a specific historical relation to class struggle. <br>
  <br>
  <b>2. The different communist currents (Leninism, Council-Communism etc.) have 
  a formal notion of class in common</b><br>
  In general the different currents grasp "capital" as just a formal relation 
  of exploitation: the surplus labour-time is appropriated by private hands or 
  by the state. The actual material process of exploitation/work is neglected. 
  This formal notion of capital leads to a formal notion of working-class: a mass 
  of exploited individuals who have to sell their labour-power due to their "non-possession" 
  of the means of production. From this similar notion of working-class different 
  political conclusions are drawn: the Leninists emphasise the need for a political 
  party that is able to gather the masses whose only coherence is the formal similarity 
  of non-possessing. The party has to give a strategical direction to the spontaneous 
  struggles of the exploited. The Council-Communists just notice that the mass 
  of exploited create their own forms of organization in struggle. They neglect 
  the question of strategy and see their main task as distributing the experiences 
  of self-organization among the workers. <br>
  <br>
  <b>3. A formal notion of class can neither explain nor support the self-emancipation 
  of the working-class</b><br>
  The formal notion of exploitation (appropriated surplus labour-time) can not 
  reveal the possibility of self- emancipation that workers can develop. As "non-possessors" 
  of means of production their power can not be explained. The mere fact that 
  they are all exploited does not create a real coherence between the individuals. 
  The possibility of self-organization can only be derived from the fact that 
  workers have a practical relation to each other and to capital: they are working 
  together in the process of production and they are part of the social division 
  of labour. As producers they are not just opposing capital as formal "wage-labourers", 
  but in their specific practice they are producing capital. Only arising from 
  this relation can workers' struggles develop their power. The isolation of workers 
  in single companies, branches etc. cannot be overcome "artificially" by taking 
  the similarity of "all being exploited" as the foundation for an organization. 
  This attempt generally ends up in another "rank-and-file" union: there will 
  always be the need for an outside institution if the coherence of the workers 
  is not based on their actual social co- operation, but just on the "formal coherence" 
  of exploited wage-labour. Leninism does not realize this deeper reason for trade-union 
  forms of workers' struggle. It tackles the problem as a mere question of leadership: 
  is the external coherence built up by the unions or the communist party? The 
  criticism of Leninism usually reduces itself to questioning just the form of 
  this external coherence: it is "undemocratic", not built by the workers themselves 
  etc. The left critics very rarely analyse the process of production in terms 
  of the foundation for the coherence of workers' struggle. Therefore they tend 
  to just follow the spontaneity of struggles without realizing or supporting 
  a strategical direction within this. Why do different political currents develop 
  despite their similar notion of class? <br>
  <br>
  <b>4. The reason for the different political notions and practice of Leninism 
  and its left critics are the different material conditions of exploitation and 
  class struggle they had to face</b><br>
  Council-Communists and others mainly criticize the patronizing and undemocratic 
  character of the Leninist Party. We think that the more profound critique on 
  Leninism consists of the analysis that the Bolshevik form of party emerged from 
  the specific material conditions in Russia in the late 19th and early 20th century. 
  An agrarian society with dispersed and isolated peasant villages, a high rate 
  of ill iteration and just few zones of industrialization could only be politically 
  unified by an external mass-organization. Therefore the most profound critique 
  of the Council Communist is that this kind of organization was not useful and 
  appropriate in their historical situation: in the industrialized regions of 
  Western Europe during the 1920s. They realized that the factories had already 
  unified the workers and that the creation of workers' councils during the revolutionary 
  period 1918-23 was the political answer of the working class. Today just a few 
  critics of Leninism reflect this "material core". The critique usually remains 
  on a political level, not touching the material roots of Leninism and other 
  currents. Today we have to put the critique on it's feet again by analysing 
  the changes in the organization of exploitation and of workers' struggle. That 
  is the precondition for the development of new political strategies. The notion 
  of class composition can help us with that. <br>
  <br>
  <b>5. The core of the notion of class composition is the thesis that there is 
  a close relation between the form of struggle and the form of production</b><br>
  Workers do not fight together because of the consciousness that "they are all 
  exploited". Struggles of workers arise from concrete work-conditions, from actual 
  situations of exploitation. Workers' struggles take different forms (in the 
  past, in different regions or sectors etc.), because the concrete labour-process 
  and therefore the material form of exploitation differs. The mode of production 
  and the position within the social process of production determines the form 
  and possibilities of a struggle: truck-drivers' struggles differ from those 
  of building-workers, strikes in factories producing for the world-market have 
  different outcomes than strikes in call centres. In the analysis of the coherence 
  of the mode of production and workers' struggle we distinguish between two different 
  notions of class composition: <br>
  * the "technical class composition" describes how capital brings together the 
  work-force; that means the conditions in the immediate process of production 
  (for instance division of labour in different departments, detachment from "administration" 
  and production, use of special machinery) and the form of re-production (living-community, 
  family-structure etc.) <br>
  * the "political class composition" describes how workers turn the "technical 
  composition" against capital. They take their coherence as a collective work-force 
  as the starting-point of their self-organization and use the means of production 
  as means of struggle. We are still discussing the question of at which particular 
  point in the process of workers' struggle we can describe it in terms of "political 
  class composition". One position uses the term as soon as workers of a single 
  company or branch organize their struggle out of the conditions of production. 
  The other position takes as a pre-condition for a new "political class composition" 
  a wave of workers' struggles that are unified into a class movement by struggles 
  in central parts of the social production process (for example in the 60s/70s 
  the focus for the class movement were mainly the struggles in automobile factories). 
  <br>
  In the following passage we want to sketch how specific forms of production 
  influence the ways, contents and perspectives of struggles: <br>
  <br>
  <i>a) immediate organization</i><br>
  Whether workers try to find individual or collective solutions for their problems 
  mainly depends on the way they have to relate to each other in the daily work-process. 
  When work is mainly based on individual performances and skills (for instance 
  handicraft work) dealing with conflicts on an individual basis is more likely. 
  When the division of labour creates a mutual dependence between workers the 
  need for a collective action is more obvious. The potential for self-organization 
  furthermore depends on the question of whether the work-process enables the 
  workers to communicate with each other (high degree of co- operation, concentration 
  of many workers in one work-place or living-area etc.) <br>
  <br>
  <i>b) immediate power</i><br>
  The foundation for the emergence, the content and prospects of workers' struggles 
  is the question of whether they can gain power against capital. That depends 
  on different circumstances, for instance if workers are concentrating on points 
  of significant importance for the process of production and accumulation; if 
  the struggle takes place in a specific economic situation (for instance boom, 
  lots of orders) or under a particular composition of capital (for instance high 
  standard of machinery requires production around the clock) that increases the 
  dependence on the work-force. <br>
  <br>
  <i>c) political content</i><br>
  "Political consciousness", the consciousness to confront capital as a class, 
  can not be brought to the workers from outside, but can only develop in the 
  struggle itself. This developing consciousness also depends on the practical 
  relation between the producers and their relation to the means of production. 
  The specific capitalist mode of production is mass-production based on division 
  of labour and machinery. Whether workers grasp exploitation just from a "unionist" 
  point of view as an unfair distribution of the product or from a "political" 
  point of view as a social relation of production with it's own laws, depends 
  on the conditions they have to work under. It is not a question of their "right 
  or wrong consciousness" as the Leninists would claim, but the question of whether 
  their exploitation is not only capitalist in a formal way (free wage-labour) 
  but also in its material way (hierarchical division of labour, machine-controlled 
  work-process etc.). <br>
  Some examples of how the specific conditions of production influence the political 
  content of workers' struggle - and their relation to capital as a mode of production: 
  <br>
  <br>
  Relation to the wage-form:<br>
  In capitalism the wage-relation, appearing as the "individual exchange of money 
  for work", conceals the fact that capital exploits the collective labour-power 
  of the workers. A worker who is hired together with a hundred other workers 
  and who has to do the same work is more likely to notice that the "individual 
  contracts" are just a fake than for example a handicraft worker who "possesses" 
  special skills and therefore special "work to sell". <br>
  <br>
  Relation to work:<br>
  Work in capitalism is abstract. The specific tasks one performs are not important, 
  but the fact that work adds surplus labour-time to the product is. A worker 
  who has to do "unskilled" work together with others will have a different relationship 
  to work than a specialized worker. The first will actually experience work as 
  abstract and will be less likely to glorify it and organize within the boundaries 
  of her or his profession. <br>
  <br>
  Relation to other workers:<br>
  A formal notion of class does not reach very far. That reveals itself when we 
  look at the composition of work-force on the shop-floor. We could state that 
  foremen, team-leaders or managers are also "wage- labourers" and therefore exploited, 
  but nearly every struggle has to enforce itself against these "little bosses". 
  The (hierarchical) division of labour of the social production process is the 
  foundation for racist and sexist divisions within the working class. So on the 
  one hand capital divides workers, but on the other hand it brings together workers 
  of every skin-colour, gender, nationality etc. in the process of production. 
  Whether divisions between workers are questioned or fortified is generally decided 
  in struggles. Factories, specific sectors etc. with a "colourful" composition 
  are especially decisive in this process. <br>
  <br>
  Relation to the means of production:<br>
  Capital is the process and result of a mode of production where the dead labour 
  (machines, work-material) commands the living work-force. A worker who has to 
  obey the rhythm of the machines, and who notices that despite the technological 
  progress his/her situation does not improve, is more likely to attack capital 
  as a contradictory mode of production. Workers of a handcraft work-process who 
  are still "masters" of their tools will more likely see the "boss" as the symbol 
  of exploitation. <br>
  <br>
  Relation to the product:<br>
  Workers in spheres of mass-production realize just by working that the quality 
  of the products plays a secondary role and that it is all about quantity. Usually 
  one can not relate to the use-value of the product, because one only sees a 
  small part of the whole production process and at a stage of the product which 
  has no use-value yet. A lot of workers are not working on a material product, 
  but they work under industry- like conditions to perform "services". We have 
  to discuss how this "immateriality" of the products impacts on the workers' 
  struggle. <br>
  It remains an open question for us how far struggles of "handicrafts", agricultural 
  workers and other proletarians who do not work under "industrial" conditions 
  can develop an anti-capitalist character. It is a decisive question how these 
  struggles can unite with the struggles of the "industrial proletariat" despite 
  the different conditions and without external mediation (like the so-called 
  "Anti-Globalisation"-Movement, "Peoples Global Action", the "Zapatistas" and 
  other organisations who try to link different "social movements") <br>
  <br>
  <i>d) expansion</i><br>
  Whether struggles can expand themselves also depends on "spontaneity", the social 
  situation and mere chance. For a political strategy it is important to analyse 
  the material foundation of an expansion: what is the relationship between a 
  single struggle and the social production? Single companies are, to a greater 
  or lesser extent, connected to the social division of labour: international 
  production chains, transport, connections to "scientific work" in universities, 
  connection to the "service sector" and distribution. So there are different 
  ways a struggle can effect society, for instance a strike the daily life of 
  a mass of workers. Do workers who are not immediately engaged in a strike notice 
  it's outcomes as producers, for instance because they can not do their work 
  due to missing parts? Do they notice it as consumers, for instance because they 
  miss their daily newspaper in the morning? For the expansion of a struggle it 
  is important that other workers are not just informed through the media, but 
  that it effects their daily work/life. These effects show the social dimension 
  of production today and so they can destroy the notion of "isolated work-places". 
  Also the social skills that workers acquire in their existence as a work-force 
  influences their potential to break through the isolation of their struggle 
  by their own activity: for instance the knowledge of how to organize and improvise 
  in the chaos of the production process, the skills to use means of communication, 
  the experiences and connections of immigrated workers etc. <br>
  <br>
  <i>e) political generalization</i><br>
  In the history of class struggle there has never occurred a "mass uprising", 
  a simultaneous uprising of the majority. It has always been small sections of 
  the proletariat (of a single factory, branch, region etc.) which start the trouble, 
  which push it forward or which become the symbol or focus of a class movement. 
  These "cores" are neither founded on "higher consciousness" nor do they emerge 
  by chance. In the 60s/70s it was mainly the workers in the automobile factories 
  who played this role. The automobile sector was the driving force of the capitalist 
  boom of the previous decades. It absorbed thousands of workers who came from 
  the different poor regions to the metropolis. It generalized the experience 
  of workers by technology and work-organization on an international level. It 
  was the centre of an international division of labour with productive connection 
  to nearly every sector. Though the product was a symbol of an increasing wealth, 
  the only chance to get a piece of it was by subjecting oneself to the command 
  of the factory. <br>
  In other times and places there have been particular regions which became the 
  centre of a movement. That was less due to "tradition" than to their significance 
  in the social process of production, for instance port- towns, mining regions. 
  In the centres of development the connection of state and capital can be noticed 
  more easily (planning of infrastructure, labour-market policy, special laws 
  etc.) and the global character of this society is obvious ("foreign investments", 
  migration etc.). We can take towns like Turin as examples for the 50s/60s or 
  the Maquilladoras in South America and "Special Development Zones" in China 
  for today. Also in Europe there a zones of development (for instance on the 
  west border of Poland, the region around Dresden, Piemont). <br>
  We think that struggles can expand without these "centres", but often the limitation 
  of strike-movements is due to the fact that the "centres" were not taking part 
  or have been defeated. So the question of "generalization" is not really a question 
  of a "political leadership", but the question of to what extent struggles can 
  socialize themselves along the lines of the social production and hit capital 
  at central points. <br>
  <br>
  <i>f) communist tendencies</i><br>
  There are widely differing notions of "communist tendency". On the one hand 
  the notion that humans have the "human need" for a better society which they 
  express in their struggles against exploitation. On the other hand the orthodox 
  notion that the development of the forces of production will overthrow capitalism 
  and will make communism possible. Leninism and most of the "left communist" 
  currents have a very mechanical notion of the forces of production: development 
  of technology and the extension of the social division of labour due to the 
  driving forces of competition. The foundation of communism is the fact that 
  the increased forces of production are able to reduce individual work-time. 
  They only deal with the fact that the forces of production are in the wrong 
  hands, and ignore the contradiction that the material form of technology (assembly 
  line), of science (Taylorism) and socialization ("globalisation") itself is 
  the foundation of capitalist command over the workers. The dissolution of this 
  contradiction can only take place in a class movement that both changes the 
  material conditions of production and "socializes" the forces of production 
  along with the struggle. Therefore, struggles have to relate to the contradiction 
  of social possibilities (enormous production of material wealth, increased productivity) 
  and reality (drudgery and relative poverty). <br>
  A central problem remains the uneven development: the forces of production do 
  not exist solely as a "stage of the forces of production" detached from the 
  workers. The state of technology, the use of science, the degree of social division 
  of labour is different in every sector, region etc. Workers have to face different 
  states of development in the work-process, so in struggles they relate in different 
  ways to the possibilities and contradictions of the social forces of production. 
  In zones of underdevelopment (no or few investments, investments in "labour 
  intensive" exploitation) the "need for communism" will, above all, express itself 
  in the workers attacking poverty and labour-intensive production as a consequence 
  of the capitalist "usage" of the social productivity. In centres of development 
  the contradiction shows itself in the fact that despite the "technological progress" 
  and "abundance", life is still ruled by drudgery and relative poverty. The main 
  question will be from which points of uneven development struggles can socialize/globalise 
  themselves as a new "force of production". Which struggles will be able to express 
  the possibility and hope for a better form of production due to the material 
  conditions (state of technology, science, division of labour etc.) they arise 
  from? <br>
  The communist revolution will have to tear down the artificial existence of 
  "development and underdevelopment". We have to ask at which points of social 
  production this process will start and develop power. <br>
  It is not easy to find good examples to show the coherence between the "stage 
  of the forces of production" and the "Utopia" of class struggles. The revolts 
  in agrarian societies had less a "social utopia" than the demand to cultivate 
  the land in their own "anarchical" way. The factory-struggles in Western Europe 
  at the beginning of the last century developed the socialist hope of running 
  the factories and therefore the whole society under workers control. The struggles 
  of the 60/70s expressed the increasing "scientification" of the production, 
  the increasing terror of machinery and alienation from work and product. The 
  distinction of "workers' struggle" and other social movements dissolved more 
  and more due to the fact that the whole society (schools, university, town infrastructure) 
  was closer connected to the "actual process of production". The centres of the 
  movement (factories, universities) appropriated much of the "productive possibilities" 
  of a modern society. The increasing division of labour inside the factory and 
  the assembly line were used to organize new forms of strikes; squatted factories 
  and universities became central meeting points, the "new science" and means 
  of communication were developed by the movement etc. By doing this the movement 
  itself became more "productive" and creative and spread the developed "forces 
  of production" into other parts of society. The movement reflected the "developed 
  forces of production" in their demands: not "factory under workers' control", 
  but "automation of the factory" and wealth for everybody... <br>
  <br>
  <b>6. Class composition expresses the inner coherence and the tendency of class 
  struggle</b><br>
  The problems above beg the questions of strategy for class struggle. The strategy 
  can only be derived from the tendencies of capitalism. In the social process 
  of production capitalism creates and connects parts of development and underdevelopment 
  as a reaction to the class contradiction, which explains the dynamic character 
  of the system. Within hi-tech factories there exist departments of different 
  "technological" levels. These factories themselves are connected to suppliers 
  of different standards of development right down to the "Third- World" sweat-shop. 
  The different levels of development are the material foundations for the divisions 
  and unevenness of class struggle. Workers' struggles which can generalize themselves 
  along the lines of "uneven development" lead to the conditions of production 
  becoming more similar. The struggles of workers in automobile factories in the 
  60s-80s had the result that the conditions in the main factories became similar 
  worldwide including former "zones of underdevelopment" (Mexico, Brazil etc.): 
  on the level of technology and also for the workers (similar relation between 
  wage and product). Capital reacts to the "political class composition" (the 
  generalization of class struggle) with a "technical re-composition", with the 
  reproduction of uneven development on a higher level: regions are "de-industrialized", 
  in others capital makes the great technological leap forward, old "core" factories 
  are divided into different units of a production chain, the production is "globalised" 
  etc. Capital creates new centres of development which can become new points 
  for the generalization of future class movements. So the inner coherence of 
  the coming class movements is anticipated. Their strategy will not grow detached 
  in the heads of revolutionaries, but lies within the process of the material 
  development (of division of labour, machinery etc.) itself. <br>
  <br>
  <b>7. The task of revolutionaries is the analysis of the capitalist development 
  in order to be able to assess and show the potentials of class struggles</b><br>
  The special role of revolutionaries can not be explained by a "political consciousness" 
  which class struggles could not achieve by themselves. It can only be derived 
  from a general view and interpretation of the things that actually happen. The 
  power, the possibilities of self-organization, of expansion and generalization 
  are set by conditions of production. The task of revolutionaries is to show 
  the coherence between the material conditions and practice and the perspective 
  of struggles. The class movement will take place within the net of development 
  and underdevelopment. Therefore, we have to show the connection of different 
  parts of this net and the political reasons for the inequality. The analysis 
  of the material foundation of workers' struggle also determines where we should 
  intervene. It is not sufficient just to follow the "spontaneous" patterns of 
  struggles and to document them. We have to look for the points which can be 
  of strategical significance for the future. These areas do not need to be the 
  "most developed" or the "centres of accumulation". Often the sectors that connect 
  different levels of development (transport between different factories, "information 
  work" between production and distribution) are significant for a generalization 
  of struggles. For this we need more than just an informal exchange between our 
  groups, we need an organized discussion and intervention. <br>
  <br>
  <b>8. Suggestions for the discussion</b><br>
  a) questions<br>
  b) Does a coherence of the form of production and forms of struggle exist? What 
  are the differences, for instance of factories and call centres and what does 
  this mean for possible conflicts?<br>
  c) Is the "immediate process of production" the central sphere of class struggle? 
  What's about other parts of proletarian existence (living area etc.)?<br>
  d) Are there "central spots" in a phase of struggle? What are their origins?<br>
  e) To which political consequences does the notion of class composition lead, 
  what is the danger (for instance reduced view on class struggle)<br>
  f) Where are the tendencies for a "new political class composition"? Where are 
  the possible spots of new workers' power and generalization of struggles?<br>
  <br>
  <b>9. Summary of the discussion about class composition at the meeting in Oberhausen, 
  April 2001</b><br>
  1) Summary of the discussion<br>
  2) Critique on the discussion itself<br>
  3) References to articles about class composition<br>
  <br>
  <b>1) Summary</b><br>
  We started with a presentation of the short version of the paper, because not 
  everybody had read the paper in the "materials". The following discussion developed 
  freely, it did not refer to the paper in detail. The discussion can be summarised 
  in four categories of questions: <br>
  a) Is the notion of class composition and its emergence strongly tied to a specific 
  historical situation and therefore not as easily applicable to the recent situation? 
  <br>
  b) Does the notion of class composition lead us to classify the class into different 
  categories of workers? Does the notion over-estimate the influence of "objective 
  conditions" and under-estimate the impact of spontaneity, experience and exemplariness 
  of actual struggles of workers? <br>
  c) Do we have to look for a "central subject" or a central sector which plays 
  an important role in class struggle - or do we have to take into account the 
  experience of every worker? <br>
  d) Does the strategy of class composition boil down to a separation between 
  revolutionaries and the actual conditions of exploitation and therefore to a 
  sociological notion and relation to class struggle? <br>
  <br>
  <i>Question a)</i><br>
  We did not agree on the importance of the discussion about the origin of the 
  actual term 'class composition' for our debate itself. There existed two general 
  lines of discussion: <br>
  <br>
  First:<br>
  The notion of class composition has its origin in a specific historical situation. 
  It was introduced in the Marxist discussion in Italy in the early 60s. The situation 
  at that time was not notable for intensive class struggle. There were just few 
  hints of new kinds of conflicts. The notion of class composition is related 
  to the emergence and development of central sectors in this period and in this 
  region: the extension of the metal and automobile sectors. The notion of class 
  composition could help us to understand the coherence between the development 
  of the material conditions within these sectors, and the re-emergence of workers' 
  power. Therefore, the notion is not applicable to other historical situations 
  without taking note of the specific differences. That has often happened during 
  the last few decades (e.g. theory of the 'social worker' or 'immaterial worker'). 
  In the last 20 to 30 years, capitalism has developed in such a way as to not 
  have a central sector of accumulation anymore; therefore the notion of class 
  composition has lost its main foundation. (references to the article: "Massenarbeiter 
  und gesellschaftlicher Arbeiter" by Battagia) <br>
  <br>
  Second:<br>
  The notion of class composition first of all describes a specific approach: 
  to analyse the potentials of workers' power and subjectivity which arise from 
  the material conditions and developments of the relation of capital. The paper 
  on "class composition" could have been written without using this specific term. 
  Previous to the discussion in Italy in the early 60s, (and so previous to the 
  introduction of the term "class composition"), there were discussions about 
  the coherence of the mode of production and the form that workers' struggles 
  take. (references to the article: "The militant Proletariat" by Lewis). That 
  capital is not generating a new central sector which connects different regions 
  and branches of industries is indeed a major problem. The problem is not that 
  we can not use our specific terms anymore, but that because of the lack of this 
  central sector the working class can not find common points of references and 
  therefore can not generalize its struggles. <br>
  <br>
  <i>question b)</i><br>
  We tried to summarize the different usage of the notion of class composition: 
  <br>
  1. As an instrument to classify different group of workers, e.g. in the sense 
  of the Marxist-Leninists, who try to label different group of workers due to 
  their supposed different class-consciousness. From this perspective workers 
  can just be seen and treated as objects. <br>
  2. As a tool of analysis for our search for conditions where collective action 
  can develop and where we can take part in discussion and activities against 
  exploitation. In this notion we see ourselves as a part of class subjectivity. 
  <br>
  3. As an approach to understand the dialectic relation between the development 
  of capital and class subjectivity. The notion of class composition is referring 
  to Marx' notion of the organic composition of capital. This term describes the 
  coherence between the accumulation of dead labour (machinery) in relation to 
  labour-power. This relation on one hand expresses the command of capital over 
  the workers, but on the other hand also contains the communist tendency within 
  capitalism (potentials to reduce necessary social labour-time). Class composition 
  describes the coherence between this objective dynamic of capitalism and workers' 
  subjectivity. <br>
  The following discussion more or less circled around the question: What is the 
  relation between the objective conditions and the subjectivity of workers? <br>
  <br>
  Classification:<br>
  There exists the danger to fall back into the mechanical Marxist-Leninists patterns 
  by trying to understand the different potentials of workers' struggle due to 
  of the different conditions they arise from. On the other hand we have to face 
  the problem that workers actually are classified and put into specific categories 
  by the capitalist production process. These classifications (e.g. to be a skilled 
  female worker in a small work-shop for global garden gnome production) can just 
  be destroyed "from within". The analysis of the specific conditions of workers 
  should not be static. Our starting-points are the specific conditions in a specific 
  sphere of exploitation, we have to try to relate them to the global class contradiction. 
  In reference to the third point of the summary of the usage of class composition 
  (the relation of workers to the organic composition of capital): Workers are 
  confronting the "organic composition" of capital and socialisation of work in 
  many different ways (e.g. Indian software companies next to textile sweat-shops). 
  We have to face and analyse the problem of how these differences can be overthrown 
  in class struggle. <br>
  <br>
  Spontaneity and experience:<br>
  It was questioned if we can derive from the "objective conditions" whether and 
  how workers will struggle. It was emphasised that we rather have to analyse 
  the actual struggles going on. Also struggles in "less important" spheres of 
  exploitation (garden gnome production) can become a role model and symbol for 
  other workers. We agreed that there is always a spontaneity of class struggle 
  and that it is a good thing that not every action is determined. But it is impossible 
  to take this spontaneity as a foundation of political strategy. Apart from analysing 
  current class struggles we should try to understand the material foundation 
  of the present day crisis of class struggle and the conditions for future conflicts. 
  In order to do that we can just relate to the actual and different conditions 
  within exploitation. <br>
  <br>
  <i>question c)</i><br>
  It was criticised that the notion of class composition is used to identify a 
  central subject within class struggle (thereby filtering out the rest). In contrary, 
  we have to see the importance of every "proletarian experience" not just at 
  the work-place, but also in the sphere of reproduction, the special experience 
  as (work-)immigrants etc. The analysis of class composition can only help us 
  to understand specific situations we are confronted with, e.g. why particular 
  divisions between workers exist on a special shop-floor. We asked ourselves 
  whether we are all searching for special conditions within exploitation, because 
  we assess their specific political importance. Also the CRO, which is insisting 
  on the immediate experience of every worker, emphasises the importance of the 
  industrial mode of production, scientific work-organisation etc. We agreed that 
  if there is a choice, we would rather work or intervene in a big factory than 
  in a two person fish and chip shop. <br>
  <br>
  <i>question d)</i><br>
  We discussed the question as to which relation between revolutionaries and class 
  derives from the notion of class composition. The analysis of class composition 
  often was a mere remedy for party and union bureaucrats to gain more influence 
  for their organisations within conflicts, despite their actual detachment from 
  the shop-floor. The analysis can only be achieved by them or other "scientists", 
  because only they have got the time and the means. However, an inquiry can only 
  be revolutionary, if it is performed by workers themselves - self-inquiry. We 
  can support this self-inquiry by leaflets etc. The analysis of class composition 
  must happen out of the concrete practice. It should not be that the analysis 
  proceeds the decision to intervene in a particular struggle. <br>
  That was opposed by the comment that revolutionaries can not just move within 
  exploitation by chance or analyse just the struggles that happen and/or we co-incidentally 
  are aware of. We should be able to understand the general and specific tendencies 
  within class struggle. <br>
  During this part of the discussion it became obvious that we use two quiet abstract 
  terms: 'class composition' and 'proletarian experience'. It is not about opposing 
  these terms but about discussing the relation between experience/intervention 
  within exploitation and the analysis of specific developments in certain areas 
  of the social production process. Thereby we have to be aware of different conditions 
  we have to face (of groups, of different regions etc.). <br>
  <br>
  <b>2) Critique on the discussion itself</b><br>
  <br>
  There were two main critiques on the discussion:<br>
  a) The discussion was to general. We should have discussed the notion of class 
  composition with regard to the situation in, and inquiry into, call centres 
  or another concrete experience. <br>
  b) In the discussion the terms "class composition" and "proletarian experience" 
  were just used as ideological labels. Therefore we did not discuss our own questions 
  about the recent situation in class struggle and our own way to relate to this 
  situation. <br>
