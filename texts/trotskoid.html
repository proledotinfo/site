<p class="title">STALINISM'S LOYAL OPPOSITION:<br>THE COUNTER-REVOLUTIONARY POLITICS 
  OF TROTSKY</p>
<p class="author">Max Anger</p>
<p>This article was originally written to refute lies about the history of 20th 
  century revolutionary movements peddled by the comically obnoxious Trotskyoids 
  of the Spartacus League, in their newspaper Workers Vanguard (sic). Fearing 
  that they may be losing ground to an admittedly incoherent contemporary anarchism, 
  and hungry for fresh cannon fodder, the Sparts ran an occasionally informative 
  series of articles by Joseph Seymour, titled "Marxism vs. Anarchism", tracing 
  the historic differences between anarchism and the Sparts’ version of "Marxism".</p>
        <p>In part 7 of this series, (W. V., page 7, 8/30/1996), the part
dealing with the Russian Revolution of 1917-1921, Seymour claimed:</p>
        <p>"The most significant counterrevolutionary force under the banner
of anarchism was the Ukrainian peasant-based army of Nestor Makhno, which
carried out pogroms against Jewish communities and collaborated with
White armies against the Bolsheviks."</p>
        <p>Seymour made these accusations without providing any documentation,
and with good reason, for outside of Stalinist hagiographies, Stalin-era
fiction like Shuslov’s And Quiet Flows the Don and Seymour’s air-brush-happy
imagination no evidence exists to support his claims.  Surviving partisans
of the Makhnovist movement, like Makhno’s comrade the ex-Bolshevik Peter
Arshinov in his History of the Makhnovist Movement, the anarchist historian
Voline in his work The Unknown Revolution, and independent historians
who are not friends of revolution or anarchism, like Stanford scholar
Michael Palij, in his book The Anarchism of Nestor Makhno, all affirm
that:</p>
        <p>1.  The Makhnovist Movement was a mass revolutionary movement
of the poor in the Southern Ukraine, and fielded an army of several tens
of thousands of partisans in the Russian Civil War.  This revolutionary
movement lasted from the spring of 1918 until a final large-scale massacre
of its partisans, and large numbers of non-combatant sympathizers, by
the Bolsheviks in 1921.</p>

       <p> 2.  Revolutionaries of Jewish origins played an important part
in the Makhnovist movement, among them Voline.  He was a key figure in
the anarcho-communist "Nabat" confederation in the Ukraine during the
Russian Civil War.</p>
       <p> 3.  Jewish communities in the Ukraine furnished numerous combatants
to Makhno’s Insurrectionary Army.  Jewish communities participated in
regional revolutionary mass assemblies of workers, peasants and partisans
called by the Revolutionary Military Council of the Makhnovist Army.</p>
        <p>4.  The Makhnovists named one of their free-communist agricultural
communes after Rosa Luxemburg, who was from a Jewish background.</p>
        <p>5.  Nestor Makhno and his comrades issued numerous proclamations
against anti-Semitism.  On several occasions Makhno himself killed instigators
of violence against the Jewish population, including a prominent bandit
named Grigor’ev.  (See Arshinov’s <EM>History of the Makhnovist Movement</EM>,
pp. 135-137.)</p>
        <p>6.  Leah Feldman, who died in London in the late 1980’s, was
the last known survivor of the Makhno movement in the west.  As a young
girl, Feldman helped sew uniforms for the Makhnovist Army.  Feldman was
from a Jewish background.  She vehemently attested to the Makhnovists’
violent hostility to anti-Semitism.</p>

        <p>In <EM>The Unknown Revolution</EM> (p. 698), Voline quotes a Jewish historian,
M. Tcherikover, interviewed in Paris, who was not an anarchist or a revolutionary:</p>
        <p>"It is undeniable that, of all these armies, including the (so-called)
Red Army, the Makhnovists behaved best with regard to the civil population
in general and the Jewish population in particular...Do not let us speak
of pogroms alleged to have been organized by Makhno himself.  This is
a slander or an error.  Nothing of the sort occurred."  [my italics].</p>
        <p>With regard to Seymour’s claim that the Makhnovists "...collaborated
with White armies against the Bolsheviks":</p>
        <p>1.  The Makhno Movement began as a class struggle of the exploited
and dispossessed against the rich in the Southern Ukraine in the spring
of 1918.  Makhno and his comrades helped initiate the seizure and redistribution
of the wealth of rich exploiters by poor folks.  Exploiters who resisted
were killed.</p>
        <p>2.  Makhno fought against Austrian and German Imperialist forces
and their allies among the local gentry, as opposed to the Bolshevik
regime, who collaborated with these enemies of the world revolution by
signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in March 1918.  Makhno’s forces played
a key role in the defeat of the Austro-German invasion of the Ukraine
and in the defeat of the Ukrainian nationalist regime of Petliura in
1918.</p>

        <p>3.  Makhno’s forces destroyed a significant portion of the White
army General Denikin’s forces in September and October 1919, thus crippling
Denikin’s attempt at that time to take Moscow.  (The Whites were the
right-wing counterrevolutionary forces in the Russian Civil War)</p>
        <p>4.  Makhno’s forces played the decisive part in the defeat of
the White general Wrangel in late 1920.  At that time an agreement was
made between the Bolshevik state, signed by Frunze and Bela Kun, and
the revolutionaries of the Makhno movement, where Makhno’s forces were
considered to be effectively a part of the so-called Red Army.  This
agreement is reproduced in Arshinov and Voline’s works.  Earlier, in
May of 1919, the leading Bolshevik Lev Kamenev had journeyed to Makhno’s
headquarters and negotiated in person with Makhno. </p> 
        <p>The Bolsheviks are the only counterrevolutionaries the Makhnovists
can be accurately accused of collaborating with.</p>
        <p>Space considerations prohibit me from describing in great detail
the counterrevolutionary treachery displayed by the Bolsheviks with regard
to the Makhnovists.  But anyone who reads the sources mentioned above
and who also reads of how the Stalinists behaved during the Spanish Civil
War will see many similarities.</p>
        <p>Seymour peddled a similar combination of ignorance and falsehoods
about the German left communists of the early 1920’s and one of their
organizations, the Communist Workers Party of Germany (KAPD).  Far from
being, as Seymour puts it, an "unstable amalgam of anarchist and Communist
politics", left communism was a sophisticated Marxist current with deep
roots among combative wage workers and poor people in Germany and Holland.
 The Dutch Marxist theoreticians Anton Pannekoek, Herman Gorter and their
comrades began developing a far-going critique of European social democracy
in the decades before World War One.  </p>
        <p>The left communists saw that any usefulness that had been played
by electoral politics and trade unions had passed.  In a revolutionary
period proletarians would have to fight for the destruction of the bourgeois
state and the abolition of wage labor and commodity relations outside
of and against all pro-capitalist workers’ organizations.  A new historical
period meant that new tactics had become necessary, and new forms of
self-organization had emerged that superseded the old dichotomy of parliamentary
activity and unions.  These were unitary expressions of proletarian power:
soviets, workers, soldiers and sailor’s councils, mass assemblies combining
political and economic aspects of the fight against capital. </p> 
        <p>Vulgar Marxists like Trotskyists, and the Stalinists they often
cheer for, will say that unions "organize workers", but the question
posed by authentically anti-capitalist revolutionaries like the German
communist left was a qualitative one: what do they organize the working
class for?</p>

<p>Trade unions and leftist parties act in the interests of the capitalist
system.  They are organizations of proletarian defeat; they were then,
they are now.  As opposed to what Trotskyists claim, pro-wage-labor leftist
parties and unions are not "betrayers" or "misleaders" of the working
class -- they are the left wing of capital, a fundamental element of
the capitalist political apparatus. </p> 
        <p>Working class self-organization means taking action outside of
and against the control of unions, parties and electoral politics.  The
best revolutionaries who came out of Trotskyism after World War Two recognized
this.  For example, see the writings of Grandizo Munis.  Munis was a
leading member of the Trotskyists’ Bolshevik-Leninist Group, which fought
alongside of the anarchist revolutionaries of the "Friends of Durruti"
group in the May 1937 uprising in Barcelona during the Spanish Civil
War.  After World War Two, Munis described labor unions as "auxiliary
organs of capital" and noted that:</p>
       <p> "...unions...function as messengers from capital to labor and
as agents who help to adapt labor to the requirements of capital...Unions,
having a bureaucratic and legal life of their own, merely use the working
class as a docile mass to manipulate in order to increase their own power
as a legal institution in our society.  Unions and working people have
completely different daily lives and motivations.  Any ‘tactical’ work
within (the union apparatus), even if guided by the purest intentions,
will impede the self-activity of the exploited class, destroying their
fighting spirit and barring the way to revolutionary activity.</p>
        <p>"Lenin and Trotsky’s position on revolutionary work within unions
is entirely outside the realm of today’s realities...There is about as
much possibility of ‘changing’ unions in a revolutionary direction as
there is of ‘changing’ capitalist society in general; unions use wage
workers for their own particular end but wage workers will never be able
to make unions serve a revolutionary goal; they must destroy them."

bookstores or for $1 from Black and Red, P. O. Box 02374, Detroit, Michigan

        <p>Lenin’s and Trotsky’s vision of the content of socialism and
the tactics that could be used in achieving it did not break fundamentally
with the pre-World War I social democratic ideology of the Second International.
 Their equation of the content of socialism with, to quote Lenin in 1918,
"a state capitalist monopoly made to benefit the entire people" helped
to destroy the revolutionary movement of their day. </p> 
        <p>During World War One the Bolsheviks were a key part of the international
revolutionary movement.  In 1917 they regrouped many of the most combative
elements of the proletarian movement in the urban centers of Russia.
 But shortly after the October Revolution the overwhelming circumstances
of the Russian Civil War, and the pronounced deficiencies of their politics,
led the Bolsheviks to pass over to the side of the counterrevolution.
 This tendency was resisted unsuccessfully by dissident currents within
the party that had some authentically communist content, the "left communists"
and the "democratic centralists."  But these minority tendencies had
no lasting impact on the party.  As early as 1921, the founding manifesto
of the short-lived (left communist) Communist Workers International declared:</p>

        <p>"Nothing can stop the flow of events, or obscure the truth. 
We are saying this without useless reticence, without sentimentalism:
proletarian Russia of red October is becoming a bourgeois state."</p>
        <p>By the time of the Kronstadt massacre in March 1921 the Russian
Revolution was dead.  To the German left communists the concept of the
dictatorship of the proletariat, which is a fundamental and necessary
element of revolutionary politics, meant the absolute social power of
the revolutionary mass movement itself against the capitalist system,
and against those who would defend it or restore it.  The Makhnovist
movement was an excellent example of this principle put into practice;
a mass movement of the poor acting in a despotic manner against exploiters
and counterrevolutionaries.  For the Bolsheviks the bottom line became
one of holding onto state power at any cost.  The Bolshevik victory came
at the expense of the possibility of revolution in Germany and Italy.
 It came at the expense of revolutionary forces that weren’t under their
control, like the Makhnovists, and at the expense of the working class
in the urban areas of Russia, who were driven out of active participation
in political life by the police terror of the Bolshevik party-state.</p>
 
        <p>The Kronstadt uprising was the last cry of the dying revolutionary
movement in Russia.  By 1921 the Lenin regime wasn’t a dictatorship of
the proletariat, it was just a dictatorship; a clique claiming to act
in the name of the working class while using terror against the working
class.  When the German left fought for "the dictatorship of the proletariat"
they didn’t mean a police state that would impose wage labor on the laboring
classes and force the development of industrialization and state capitalism
at their expense, which is what the Bolsheviks ended up doing.</p>
        <p>The Spart’s Joseph Seymour was undoubtedly right when he quoted
the American Trotskyist James Cannon bragging that Lenin’s polemic "Left-Wing
Communism: an Infantile Disorder" banished the left communists’ perspective
from an effective presence in the workers’ movement in the US and elsewhere.
 From the early 1920’s on, the Leninist attachment to pre-World War I
social democratic tactics like electoral politics and political activity
within pro-capitalist labor unions dominated the perspectives of the
so-called Communists.  But if these tactics were correct ones, why did
they lead to such a dismal set of results? </p> 
        <p>The revolutionary movement of the inter-war period was defeated.
 The defeat of the revolutionary movement was accompanied by the rise
of fascism and Stalinism, and 50 million people died in the imperialist
Second World War.  Leninism didn’t result in even a single successful
proletarian revolution.  Leninism didn’t give rise to a society anywhere
in the world worthy of the human beings that live in it.</p>
        <p>Today capitalism rules in every country.  But not in the befogged
consciousness of Trotskyists, who, in their terminal fealty to Stalinism
and need to compensate for their own total historical failure obscenely
describe regimes that exploit, imprison and murder wage laborers in Cuba,
North Korea, and China as "workers’ states".</p>

        <p>Trotskyism isn’t a theoretical tool for understanding and changing
reality, but a dogma, an impoverished and sterile amalgam of social democracy
and Stalinism; an ersatz "socialism" devoid of social content.  Trotskyism
is a religion trip worshipping Lenin and Trotsky, around whom all history
is made to revolve in a Ptolemaic system.  It’s fitting that when confronted
by a revolutionary movement like the Makhnovists, Trotskyists parrot
the line of the Stalinists, the more successful fellow worshipers of
the Lenin mummy-cult.  Trotskyism is Stalinism’s loyal opposition.  Since
no Trotskyist movement has ever taken power anywhere, Trotskyists have
compensated by being cheerleaders for Stalinism and pro-capitalist "national
liberation" movements, forces the Trots have more in common with than
class war anarcho-communists like Makhno and the left communists of the
KAPD.</p>
        <p>The defeat of the Russian Revolution, and the Leninist ideology
that flowed from that defeat, led the revolutionary possibilities of
the 20th century into a total historical dead-end.  The main historical
legacy of Leninism is a globally defeated and disoriented proletariat.
 The working class doesn’t hold power anywhere today.  But now we can
see the world in a different, demystified light.  New opportunities will
present themselves in the coming decades.  We have to utterly destroy
the capitalist world order, demolish it totally, without equivocations
or compromises.  We can’t let the future be held hostage by the failures
of the past.</p>


<p>With Kronstadt and Makhno against Lenin and Trotsky, <br>
for worldwide anti-statist communist revolution,</p>
