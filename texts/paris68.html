<p class="title">Paris: May 1968 </p>
<p class="author">by Maurice Brinton<br>First edition published by Solidarity, June 1968 This edition 
  published jointly by Dark Star Press and Rebel Press, 1986 </p>
<p class="subtitle">Introduction</p>
<p>This is an eye-witness account of two weeks spent in Paris during, May 1968. 
  It is what one person saw, heard or discovered during that short period. The 
  account has no pretence at comprehensives. It has been written and produced 
  in haste, its purpose being to inform rather than to analyze - and to inform 
  quickly.</p>
<p>
  The French events have a significance that extends far beyond the frontiers 
  of modern France, They will leave their mark on the history of the second half 
  of the 20th century. French bourgeois society has just been shaken to its foundations, 
  Whatever the outcome of the present struggler we must calmly take note of the 
  fact that the political map if Western capitalist society will never be the 
  same again. A whole epoch has just come to an end: the epoch during which people 
  couldn't say, with a semblance of verisimilitude, that 'it couldn't happen here'. 
  Another epoch is starting: that in which people know that revolution is possible 
  under the conditions of modern bureaucratic capitalism.</p>
<p>
  For Stalinism too, a whole period is ending: The period during which Communist 
  Parties in Western Europe could claim (admittedly with dwindling credibility) 
  that they remained revolutionary organizations, but that revolutionary opportunities 
  had never really presented themselves. This notion has now irrevocably been 
  swept into the proverbial 'dustbin of history'. When the chips were down, the 
  French Communist Party and those workers under its influence proved to be the 
  final and most effective 'brake' on the development of the revolutionary self-activity 
  of the working class. </p>
<p>
  A full analysis of the French events will eventually have to be attempted, for, 
  without an understanding of modern society, it will never be possible consciously 
  to change it. But this analysis will have to wait for a while until some of 
  the dust has settled. What can be said now is that if honestly carried out, 
  such an analysis will compel many orthodox revolutionaries to discard a mass 
  of outdated slogans and myths to reassess contemporary reality; particularly 
  the reality of modern bureaucratic capitalism. its dynamic, its methods of control 
  and manipulation, the reasons for both its resilience and its brittleness and 
  - most important of all - the nature of its crises. Concepts and organizations 
  that have been found wanting will have to be discarded. The new phenomena (new 
  in themselves or new to traditional revolutionary theory) will have to be recognized 
  for what they are and interpreted in all their implications, The real events 
  of 1968 will then have to be integrated into a new framework of ideas, for without 
  this developmental revolutionary theory, there can be no development of revolutionary 
  practice - and in the long run no transformation of society through the conscious 
  actions of men.</p>
<p class="subtitle">
  Rue Gay-Lussac<br>
  Sunday 12 May</p>
<p>
  The rue Gay-Lussac still carries the scars of the 'night of the barricades'. 
  Burnt out cars line the pavement, their carcasses a dirty grey under the missing 
  paint. The cobbles, cleared from the middle of the road, lie in huge mounds 
  on either side. A vague smell of tear gas still lingers in the air. <br>
  At the junction with the rue des Ursulines lies a building site, its wire mesh 
  fence breached in several places. From here came material for at least a dozen 
  barricades: planks, wheelbarrows, metal drums, steel girders, cement mixers, 
  blocks of stone. The site also yielded a pneumatic drill. The students couldn't 
  use it, of course - not until a passing building worker showed them how, perhaps 
  the first worker actively to support the student revolt. Once broken, the road 
  surface provided cobbles, soon put to a variety of uses. All that is already 
  history.</p>
<p>
  People are walking up and down the street, as if trying to convince themselves 
  that it really happened. They aren't students. The students themselves know 
  what happened and why it happened. They aren't local inhabitants either, The 
  local inhabitants saw what happened, the viciousness of the CRS charges, the 
  assaults on the wounded, the attacks on innocent bystanders, the unleashed fury 
  of the state machine against those who had challenged it. The people in the 
  streets are the ordinary people of Paris, people from neighboring districts, 
  horrified at what they have heard over the radio or read in their papers and 
  who have come for a walk on a fine Sunday morning to see for themselves. They 
  are talking in small clusters with the inhabitants of the rue Gay-Lussac. The 
  Revolution, having for a week held the university and the streets of the Latin 
  Quarter, is beginning to take hold of the minds of men.</p>
<p>
  On Friday 3 May the CRS had paid their historic visit to the forborne. They 
  had been invited in by Paul Roche, Hector of Paris University. The Rector had 
  almost certainly acted in connivance with Alain Peyrefitte, Minister of Education, 
  if not with the Elysee itself. Many students had been arrested, beaten up, and 
  several were summarily convicted.</p>
<p>
  The unbelievable - yet thoroughly predictable - ineptitude of this bureaucratic 
  'solution' to the 'problem' of student discontent triggered off a chain reaction. 
  It provided the pent-up anger, resentment and frustration of tens of thousands 
  of young people with both a reason for further action and with an attainable 
  objective. The students, evicted from the university, took to the street, demanding 
  the liberation of their comrades, the reopening of their faculties, the withdrawal 
  of the cops.</p>
<p>
  Layers upon layers of new people were soon drawn into the struggle. The student 
  union (UNEF) and the union representing university teaching staff (SNESUP) called 
  for an unlimited strike. For a week the students held their ground, in ever 
  bigger and more militant street demonstrations. On Tuesday 7 May 50,000 students 
  and teachers marched through the streets behind a single banner: 'Vive La Commune', 
  and sang the Internationals at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, at the Arc de 
  Triomphe. On Friday 10 May students and teachers decided to occupy the Latin 
  Quarter en masse. They felt they had more right to be there than the police, 
  for whom barracks were provided elsewhere. The cohesion and sense of purpose 
  of the demonstrators terrified the Establishment. Power couldn't be allowed 
  to lie with this rabble, who had even had the audacity to erect barricades. 
  </p>
<p>
  Another inept gesture was needed. Another administrative reflex duly materialized. 
  Fouchet (Minister Of the interior) and Joxe (Deputy Prime Minister) ordered 
  Grimaud (Superintendent of the Paris police) to clear the streets. The order 
  was confirmed in writing, doubtless to be preserved for posterity as an example 
  of what not to do in certain situations. The CRS charged...clearing the rue 
  Gay-Lussac and opening the doors to the second phase of the Revolution. </p>
<p>
  In the rue Gay-Lussac and in adjoining streets, the battle-scarred wails carry 
  a dual message. They bear testimony to the incredible courage of those who held 
  the area for several hours against a deluge of tear gas, phosphorous grenades 
  and repeated charges of club-swinging CRS. But they also show something of what 
  the defenders were striving for... </p>
<p>
  Mural propaganda is an integral part of the revolutionary Paris of May 1968. 
  It has become a mass activity, part and parcel of the Revolution's method of. 
  self-expression. The walls of, the Latin Quarter are the depository of a new 
  rationality, no longer confined to books, but democratically displayed at street 
  level and made available to all. The trivial and the profound, the traditional 
  and the esoteric, rub shoulders in this new fraternity, rapidly breaking down 
  the rigid barriers and compartments in people's minds. 'D&eacute;sob&eacute;ir 
  d'abord: alors &eacute;cris sur les murs (Loi du 10 Mai 1968)' reads an obviously 
  recent inscription, clearly setting the tone. 'Si tout le people faisait comme 
  nous' (if everybody acted like us...) wistfully dreams another in joyful anticipation, 
  l think, rather than in any spirit of self-satisfied substitutionary. Most of 
  the slogans are straightforward, correct and fairly orthodox: 'Lib&eacute;rez 
  nos camarades' ; 'Fouchet, Grimaud, d&eacute;mission'; 'A b&agrave;s l'Etat 
  policier'; 'Gr&egrave;ve G&eacute;n&eacute;rale fundi'; 'Travailleurs, &eacute;tudiants, 
  soldaires'; 'Vive les Conseils Ouvriers'. Other slogans reflect the new concerns: 
  'La publicity te manipule'; 'Examens = hi&eacute;rarchie'; 'L'art est mort, 
  ne consommes pas son cadavre'; 'A b&agrave;s la society de consummation'' 'Debout 
  les damnes de Nanterre . The slogan 'Baisses-toi et broute'(Bend your head and 
  chew the cud) is obviously aimed at those whose minds are still full of traditional 
  preoccupations. 'Centre Ia fermentation groupusculaire' moans a large scarlet 
  inscription. This one is really out of touch. For everywhere there is a profusion 
  of pasted up posters and journals; V'oix Ouvri&egrave;re, Avant-Garde and Revoltes 
  (for the Trotskyists), Servir Ie Peuple and Humanity Nouvelle (for the devotees 
  of Chairman Mao), Le Libertaire (for the Anarchists), Tribune Socialiste (for 
  the PSU), Even odd copies of L&#8217;Humanit&eacute; are pasted up. It is difficult 
  to read them, so covered are they with critical comments. </p>
<p>
  On a hoarding, I see a large advertisement for a new brand of cheese; a child 
  biting into an enormous sandwich. 'C'est bon Ie fromage So-and-so' runs the 
  patter. Someone has covered the last few words with red paint. The poster reads 
  'C'est bon la Revolution'. People pass by, look, and smile.</p>
<p>
  I talk to my companion, a man of about 45, an 'old' revolutionary. We discuss 
  the tremendous possibilities now opening up. He suddenly turns towards me and 
  comes out with a memorable phrase: &#8220;To think one had to have kids and 
  wait 20 years to see all this...'' We talk to others in the street, to young 
  and old, to the 'political' and the 'un-political', to people at all levels 
  of understanding and commitment. Everyone is prepared to talk - in fact everyone 
  wants to. They all seem remarkably articulate. We find no-one prepared to defend 
  the actions of the administration. The 'critics' fall into two main groups'. 
 </p>
<p>
  The 'progressive' university teachers, the Communists, and a number of students 
  see the main root of the student 'crisis' in the backwardness of the university 
  in relation to society's current needs, in the quantitative inadequacy of the 
  tuition provided, in the semi-feudal attitudes of some professors, and in the 
  general insufficiency of job opportunities. They see the University as unadapted 
  to the modern world. The remedy for them is adaptation: a modernizing reform 
  which would sweep away the cobwebs, provide more teachers, better lecture theatres, 
  a bigger educational budget, perhaps a more liberal attitude on the campus and, 
  at the end of it all, an assured job.</p>
<p>
  The rebels (which include some but by no means all of the 'old' revolutionaries) 
  see this concern with adapting the university to modern society as something 
  of a diversion. For it is modern society itself which they reject. They consider 
  bourgeois life trivial and mediocre, repressive and repressed. They have no 
  yearning (but only contempt) for the administrative and managerial careers it 
  holds out for them. They are not seeking integration into adult society. On 
  the contrary, they are seeking a chance radically to contest its adulteration. 
  The driving force of their revolt is their own alienation, the meaninglessness 
  of life under modern bureaucratic capitalism. It is certainly not a purely economic 
  deterioration in their standard of living.</p>
<p>
  It is no accident that the 'revolution' started in the Nanterre faculties of 
  Sociology and Psychology. The students saw that the sociology they were being 
  taught was a means of controlling and manipulating society, not a means of understanding 
  it in order to change it. In the process they' discovered revolutionary sociology. 
  They rejected the niche allocated to them in the great bureaucratic pyramid, 
  that of 'experts' in the service of a technocratic Establishment, specialists 
  of the 'human factor' in the modern industrial equation. In the process they 
  discovered the importance of the working class. The amazing thing is that, at 
  least among the active layers of the students, these 'sectarians' suddenly seem 
  to have become the majority', surely the best definition of any revolution. 
 </p>
<p>
  The two types of 'criticism' of the modern French educational system do not 
  neutralism one another. On the contrary, each creates its own kind of problems 
  for the University authorities and for the officials at the Ministry of Education. 
  The real point is that one kind of criticism what one might call the quantitative 
  one - could in time be coped with by modern bourgeois society'. The other - 
  the qualitative one - never. This is what gives it its revolutionary potential. 
  The 'trouble with the University', for the powers that be, isn't that money 
  can't be found for more teachers. It can. The 'trouble' is that the University 
  is full of students - and that the heads of the students are full of revolutionary 
  ideas. </p>
<p>
  Among those we speak to there is a deep awareness that the problem cannot be 
  solved in the Latin Quarter, that isolation of the revolt in a student 'ghetto' 
  (even an 'autonomous' one) would spell defeat. They realize that the salvation 
  of the movement lies in its extension to other sectors of the population. But 
  here wide differences appear. When some talk of the importance of the working 
  class it is as a substitute for getting on with any kind of struggle themselves, 
  an excuse for denigrating the students' struggle and 'adventurist'. Yet it is 
  precisely because of its unparalleled militancy that the students' action has 
  established that direct Action works, has begun to influence the younger workers 
  and to rattle the established organizations. Other students realize the relationship 
  of these struggles more clearly. We will find them later at Censier (see page 
  31 ), animating the 'worker-student' action committees, But enough, for the 
  time being, about the Latin Quarter. The movement has already spread beyond 
  its narrow confines.</p>
<p class="subtitle">
  May 13th:From Renault to the streets of Paris<br>
  Monday 13 May</p>
<p>
  6:15am, Avenue Yves Kermen. A clear, cloudless day. Crowds begin to gather outside 
  the pates of the giant Renault works at Boulogne-Billancourt. The main trade 
  union 'centrales' (CGT, CFDT and FO) have called a one day general strike, They 
  are protesting against police violence in the Latin Quarter and in support of 
  long-neglected claims concerning wages, hours, the age of retirement and trade 
  union rights in the plants. </p>
<p>
  The factory gales are wide open. Not a cop or supervisor in sight, The workers 
  stream in. A loud hailer tells them to proceed to their respective shops, to 
  refuse to start work and to proceed, at 8am, to their traditional meeting place, 
  an enormous shed-like structure in the middle of the Lle Seguin (an island in 
  the Seine entirely covered by parts of the Renault plant). </p>
<p>
  As each worker goes through the gated, the pickets give him a leaflet, jointly 
  produced by the three unions. Leaflets in Spanish are also distributed (over 
  2000 Spanish workers are employed at Renault). French and Spanish orators succeed 
  one another, in shod spells, at the microphone. Although all the unions are 
  supporting the one-day strike, all the orators seem to belong to the CGT, it's 
  their loudspeaker... </p>
<p>
  6:45am, Hundreds of workers are now streaming in. Many look as if they had corpse 
  to work rather than to participate in mass meetings at the plant. The decision 
  to call the strike was only taken on the Saturday afternoon, after many of the 
  men had already dispersed for the weekend. Many seem unaware of what it's all 
  about. l am struck by the number of Algerian and black workers. There are only' 
  a few posters at the gate, again mainly those of the CGT. Some pickets carry 
  CF DT posters. There isn't an FO poster in sight. The road and walls outside 
  the factory have been well covered with slogans: 'One day strike on Monday'; 
  'Unity in defense of our claims'' 'NO to the monopolies'. </p>
<p>
  The little caf&eacute; near the gales is packed. People seem unusually wide 
  awake and communicative for so early an hour, A newspaper kiosk is selling about 
  three copies of L'Humanit&eacute; for every copy of anything else. The local 
  branch of the Communist Party is distributing a leaflet calling for 'resolution, 
  calm, vigilance and unity' and warning against 'provocateurs'.</p>
<p>
  The pickets make no attempt to argue with those pouring in. No-one seems to 
  know whether they will obey the strike call or not. Less than 25% of Renault 
  workers belong to any union at all. This is the biggest car factory in Europe. 
  The loud hailer hammers home its message: The CRS have recently assaulted peasants 
  at Quimper, and workers at Caen, Lyon and Dassault. Now they are turning on 
  the students. The regime will not tolerate opposition. It will not modernize 
  the country. It will not grant us our basic wage demands. Our one day strike 
  will show both Government and employers our determination. We must compel them 
  to retreat.'' The message is repeated again and again, like a gramophone record. 
  I wonder whether the speaker believes what he says, whether he even senses what 
  lies ahead. </p>
<p>
  At 7am a dozen Trotskyists of the FER (F&eacute;d&eacute;ration des Etudiants 
  R&eacute;volutionaires) turn up to sell their paper Revoltes. They wear large 
  red and white buttons proclaiming their identity. A little later another group 
  arrives to sell Voix Ouvriere. The loudspeaker immediately switches from an 
  attack on the Gaullist government and its CRS to an attack on&quot; 'provocateurs'' 
  and &quot;disruptive elements, alien to the working class''. The Stalinist speaker 
  hints that the sellers are in the pay of the government, As they are here, ''the 
  police must be lurking in the neighborhood''. Heated arguments break out between 
  sellers and CGT officials. The CFDT pickets are refused the use of the loudhailer. 
  They shout ''d&egrave;mocratie ouvri&ecirc;re'' and defend the right of the 
  'disruptive elements' to sell their stuff. A rather abstract right, as not a 
  sheet is sold. The front page of Revoltes carries an esoteric article on Eastern 
  Europe. </p>
<p>
  Much invective (but no blows) are exchanged. In the course of an argument I 
  hear Bro. Trigon (delegate to the second electoral 'college' at Renault) describe 
  Danny Cohn-Bandit as ''un agent du pouvoir'' (an agent of the authorities). 
  A student takes him up on this point. The Trots don't. Shortly before 8am they 
  walk off, their 'act of presence' accomplished and duly recorded for history. 
  </p>
<p>
  At about the same time, hundreds of workers who had entered the factory leave 
  their shops and assemble in the sunshine in an open space a few hundred yards 
  inside the main gate. From there they amble towards Lle Seguin, crossing one 
  arm of the river Seine on the way. Other processions heave other points of the 
  factory and converge on the same area. The metallic ceiling is nearly 200 feet 
  above our heads, Enormous stocks of components are piled up high right and left. 
  Far away to the right an assembly line is still working, lifting what looks 
  like rear car seats, complete with attached springs, from the ground to first 
  floor level. </p>
<p> Some 10,000 workers are soon assembled in the shed. The orators address them 
  through a loudspeaker from a narrow platform some 40 feet up. The platform runs 
  in front of what looks like an elevated inspection post but which I am told 
  is a union office inside the factor. The CGT speaker deals with various sectional 
  wage claims. He denounces the resistance of the government ''in the hands of 
  the monopolies'', He produces facts and figures dealing with the wage structure, 
  Many highly skilled men are not getting enough. A CFDT speaker follows him. 
  He deals with the steady speed-up, with the worsening of working conditions, 
  with accidents and with the fate of man in production. &quot;What kind of life 
  is this? Are we always to remain puppets, carrying out every whim of the management?'' 
  He advocates uniform wage increases for all ('augmentations non-hi&eacute;rarchis&eacute;es'), 
  An FO speaker follows. He is technically the most competent, but says the least. 
  In flowery rhetoric he talks of 1936, but omits all reference to L&eacute;on 
  Blum. The record of FO is bad in the factory and the speaker is heckled from 
  time to time, The CGT speakers then ask the workers to participate en masse 
  in the big rally planned for that afternoon. As the last speaker finishes, the 
  crowd spontaneously breaks out into a rousing 'Internationale', The older men 
  seem to know most of the words. The younger workers only know the chorus. A 
  friend nearby assures me that in 20 years this is the first time he has heard 
  the song sung inside Renault (he has attended dozens of mass meetings in the 
  Lle Seguin). There is an atmosphere of excitement, particularly among the younger 
  workers. </p>
<p>
  The crowd then breaks up into several sections. Some walk back over the bridge 
  and out of the factory. Others proceed systematically through the shops where 
  a few hundred blokes are still at work. Some of tees: men argue but most seem 
  only too glad for an excuse to stop and join in the procession. Gangs weave 
  their way, joking and singing, amid the giant presses and tanks. Those remaining 
  at work are ironically cheered, clapped or exhaled to ''step on it'' or ''work 
  harder''. Occasional foremen look on helplessly, as One assembly line after 
  another is brought to a halt. </p>
<p>
  Many of the lathes have colored pictures plastered over them: pin-ups and green 
  fields, sex and sunshine. Anyone still working is exhorted to get out into the 
  daylight, not just to dream about it, in the main plant, over half a mile long, 
  hardly 12 men remain in their overalls. Not an angry voice can be heard. There 
  is much good humored banter. By 1l am thousands of workers have poured out into 
  the warmth of a morning in May. An open-air beer and sandwich stall, outside 
  the gate, is doing a roaring trade. </p>
<p class="subtitle">
  Monday 13 May 1 , 15 pm. </p>
<p>
  The streets are crowded; the response to the call for a 24-hour general strike 
  has exceeded the wildest hopes of the trade unions. Despite the short notice 
  Paris is paralyzed. The strike was only decided 48 hours ago, after the 'night 
  of the barricades'. It is moreover 'illegal'. The law of the land demands a 
  five-day notice before an 'official' strike can be called. Too bad for legality. 
  A solid phalanx of young people is walking up the Boulevard de S&eacute;bastopol, 
  towards the Gare de I'Est. They are proceeding to the student rallying point 
  for the giant demonstration called jointly by the unions, the students' organization 
  (UNEF) and the teachers' associations (FEN and SNESup). </p>
<p>
  There is not a bus or car in sight. The streets of Paris today belong to the 
  demonstrators. Thousands of them are already in the square in front of the station, 
  Thousands more are moving in from every direction. The plan agreed by the sponsoring 
  organizations is for the different categories to assemble separately and then 
  to converge on the Place de Ia R&eacute;publique, from where the march will 
  proceed across Paris, via the Latin Quarter: to the Piace Denfert-Rochereau. 
  We are already packed like sardines for as far as the eye can see, yet there 
  is more than an hour to go before we are due to proceed. The sun has been shining 
  all day; the girls are in summer dresses, the young men in shirt sleeves. A 
  red flag is flying over the railway station. There are many red flags in the 
  crowd and several black ones too. </p>
<p>
  A man suddenly appears carrying a suitcase full of duplicated leaflets. He belongs 
  to some left 'groupuscule' or other. He opens his suitcase and distributes perhaps 
  a dozen leaflets. But he doesn't have to continue alone. There is an unquenchable 
  thirst for information, ideas, literature, argument, polemic. The man just stands 
  there as people surround him and press forward to get the leaflets. Dozens of 
  demonstrators, without even reading the leaflet, help him distribute them. Some 
  6000 copies get out in a few minutes. AII seem to be assiduously read, People 
  argue, laugh, joke. I witnessed such scenes again and again. </p>
<p>
  Sellers of revolutionary literature are doing well. An edict, signed by the 
  organizers of the demonstration, that lathe only literature allowed would be 
  that of the organizations sponsoring the demonstration'' (see L'Humanit&eacute;, 
  13 May 1968, page 5) is being enthusiastically flouted. This bureaucratic restriction 
  (much criticized the previous evening when announced at Censier by the student 
  delegates to the Coordinating Committee) obviously cannot be enforced in a crowd 
  of this size. The revolution is bigger than any organization, more tolerant 
  than any institution 'representing' the masses, more realistic than any edict 
  of any Central Committee. Demonstrators have climbed onto walls, onto the roofs 
  of bus stops, onto the railings in front of the station. Some have loud hailers 
  and make short speeches. All the 'politicos' seem to be in one part or other 
  of this crowd. I can see the banner of the Jeunesse Communiste R&eacute;volutionaire, 
  portraits of Castro and Che Guevara, the banner of the FER, several banners 
  of 'Servir le Peuple' (a Maoist group). and the banner of the UJCML (Union de 
  Ia Jeunesse Communiste Marxiste-L&eacute;niniste), another Maoist tendency. 
  There are also banners from many educational establishments now occupied by 
  those who work there. Large groups of lichens (high school kids) mingle with 
  the students as do many thousands of teachers. At about 2pm the student section 
  sets off, singing the Internationale. We march 20-30 abreast, arms linked. There 
  is a row of red flags in front of us, then a banner 50 feet wide carrying four 
  simple words: 'Etudiants, Enseignants, Travailleurs, Solidaires'. It is an impressive 
  sight. </p>
<p>
  The whole Boulevard de Magenta is a solid seething mass of humanity. We can't 
  enter the Place de la R&eacute;publique, already packed foil of demonstrators. 
  One can't even move along the pavements or through adjacent streets. Nothing 
  but people, as far as the eye can see. As we proceed slowly down the Boulevard 
  de Magenta, we notice on a third floor balcony, high on our right, an SFIO (Socialist 
  Party) headquarters, The balcony is bedecked with a few decrepit-looking red 
  flags and a banner proclaiming 'Solidarity with the students'. A few elderly 
  characters wave at us, somewhat self-consciously, Someone in the crowd starts 
  chanting ''O-pur-tu-nistes''. The slogan is taken up, rhythmically roared by 
  thousands, to the discomfiture of those on the balcony who beat a hasty retreat, 
  The people have not forgotten the use of the CRS against the striking miners 
  in 1958 by 'socialist' Minister of the Interior Jules Moch, They remember the 
  'socialist' Prime Minister Guy Mollet and his role during the Algerian War. 
  Mercilessly, the crowd shows its contempt for the discredited politicians now 
  seeking to jump on the bandwagon. ''Guy Mollet, au mus&eacute;e'', they shout, 
  amid laughter. It is truly the end of an epoch. At about 3pm we at last reach 
  the Place de Ia R&eacute;publique, our point of departure, The crowd here is 
  so dense that several people faint and have to be carried into neighboring cafes, 
  Here people are packed almost as tight as in the street, but can at least avoid 
  being injured, The window of one caf&eacute; gives way under the pressure of 
  the crowd outside, There is a genuine fear, in several pads of the crowd, of 
  being crushed to death. The first union contingents fortunately begin to leave 
  the square. There isn't a policeman in sight. Although the demonstration has 
  been announced as a joint one, the CGT leaders are still striving desperately 
  to avoid a mixing-up, on the streets, of students and workers. In this they 
  are moderately successful. By about 4.3Opm the students' and teachers' contingent, 
  perhaps 80,000 strong, finally leaves the Place de Ia R&eacute;publique, Hundreds 
  of thousands of demonstrators have preceded it, hundreds of thousands follow 
  it, but the 'left' contingent has been well and truly 'bottled-in'. Several 
  groups, understanding at last the CGT'S maneuver, break loose once we are out 
  of the square. They take shod cuts via various side streets, at the double, 
  and succeed in infiltrating groups of 100 or so into pads of the march ahead 
  of them or behind them. The Stalinist stewards walking hand in hand an. hemming 
  the march in on either side are powerless to prevent these sudden influxes. 
  The student demonstrators scatter like fish in water as soon as they have entered 
  a given contingent. The CGT marchers themselves are quite friendly and readily 
  assimilate the newcomers, not quite sure what it's ail about, The students' 
  appearances dress and speech does not enable them to be identified as readily 
  as they would be in Britain.</p>
<p>
  The main student contingent proceeds as a compact body. Now that we are past 
  the bottleneck of the Place de la R&eacute;publique the pace is quite rapid. 
  The student group nevertheless takes at least half an hour to pass a given point. 
  The slogans of the students contrast strikingly with those of the CGT. The students 
  shout ''Le Pouvoir aux Ouvriers'' (All Power to the Workers); ''Le Pouvoir est 
  dens Ia rue'' (Power lies in the street)',&quot;'Lib&eacute;rez nos camarades''. 
  COT members shout ''Pompidou, d&eacute;mission'' (Pompidou, resign). The students 
  chant &quot;de Gaulle, assassin'', or 'ICRS-SS''. The CGT: ('Des soul, pas de 
  matraques'' (money, not police clubs) or ''D&eacute;fense du pouvoir d'achat'' 
  (Defend our purchasing power) The students say &quot;Non &agrave; l'Universit&eacute; 
  de classe''. The CGT and the Stalinist students, grouped around the banner of 
  their paper Claret reply &quot;Universit&eacute; D&eacute;mocratique''. Deep 
  political differences lie behind the differences of emphasis. some slogans are 
  taken up by everyone, slogans such as &quot;Dix ens, c'est assez'' ,''A bas 
  L'Etat policier'', or ''Bon anniversaire, mon G&eacute;n&eacute;ral''. Whole 
  groups mournfully intone a well-known refrain: ''Adieu, de Gaulle''. They wave 
  their handkerchiefs, to the great merriment of the bystanders. As the main student 
  contingent crosses the Pont St Michel to enter the Latin Quarter it suddenly 
  stops, in silent tribute to its wounded. All thoughts are for a moment switched 
  to those lying in hospital, their sight in danger through too much tear gas 
  or their skulls or ribs fractured by the truncheons of the CRS. The sudden, 
  angry silence of this noisiest pad of the demonstration conveys a deep impression 
  of strength and resolution. One senses massive accounts yet to be settled.</p>
<p>
  At the top of the Boulevard St Michel I drop out of the march, climb onto a 
  parapet lining the Luxembourg Gardens, and just watch. l remain there for two 
  hours as row after row of demonstrators marches past, 30 or more abreast, a 
  human tidal wave of fantastic, inconceivable size, How many are they? 600,000? 
  800,000? A million? 1 ,500,000? No-one can really number them. The first of 
  the demonstrators reached the final dispersal point hours before the last ranks 
  had left the Place de Ia R&eacute;publique, at 7pm. There were banners of every 
  kind: union banners, student banners, political banners, non-political banners, 
  reformist banners, revolutionary banners, banners of the 'Mouvement contra -Armement 
  Atomique', banners of various Conseils de Parents d'El&egrave;ves, banners of 
  every conceivable size and shape, proclaiming a common abhorrence at what had 
  happened and a common will to struggle on. Some banners were notably applauded, 
  such as the one saying 'Lib&eacute;rons'information'(let's have a free news 
  service) carried by a group of employees from the ORTF. Some banners indulged 
  in vivid symbolism, such as the gruesome one carried by a group of artists, 
  depicting human hands. heads and eyes, each with its price tag, on display on 
  the hooks and trays of a butcher's shop. Endlessly they filed past, There were 
  whole sections of hospital personnel, in white coats, some carrying posters 
  saying 'O&ugrave; sent les dispartls des hopitatlx?' (where are the missing 
  injured?). Every factory, every major workplace seemed to be represented, There 
  Were numerous groups of, railway men, postmen, printers, Metro personnel, metal 
  workers, airport workers, market men, electricians, lawyers, supermen, bank 
  employees, building workers, glass and chemical workers, waiters, municipal 
  employees: painters and decorators, gas workers, shop girls, insurance clerks, 
  road sweepers, film studio operators, busmen, teachers, Sharkers from the new 
  plastic industries, row upon row upon row of them, the flesh and blood of modern 
  capitalist society, an unending maze, a power that could sweep everything before 
  it, if it but decided to do so, My thoughts went to those who say that the workers 
  are only interested in football, in the 'tierc&eacute;' (horse-betting), in 
  watching the telly and that the working class , in their annual 'conges' (holidays), 
  cannot see beyond the problems of its everyday life. It was so palpably untrue. 
  I also thought of those who say that only a narrow and rotten leadership lies 
  between the masses and the total transformation of society. It was equally untrue. 
  Today the working class is becoming conscious of its strength. Will it decide, 
  tomorrow, to use it?</p>
<p>
  I rejoin the march and we proceed towards Dented Rochereau. We pass several 
  statues, sedate gentlemen now bedecked with red flags or carrying slogans such 
  as 'Lib&eacute;rez nos camarades'. As we pass a hospital silence again descends 
  on the endless crowd. Someone starts whistling the Internationale, Others take 
  it up. Like a breeze rustling over an enormous field of corn, the whistled tune 
  ripples out in all directions. From the windows of the hospital some nurses 
  wave at us.</p>
<p>
  At various intersections we pass traffic lights which by some strange inertia 
  still seem to be working. Red and green alternate, at fixed intervals, meaning 
  as little as bourgeois education, as work in modern society, as the lives of 
  those walking past. The reality of today, for a few hours, has submerged all 
  of yesterday's patterns. The part of the march in which l find myself is now 
  rapidly approaching what the organizers have decided should be the dispersal 
  point. The CGT is desperately keen that its hundreds of thousands of supporters 
  should disperse quietly, It fears them, when they are together. It wants them 
  nameless atoms again, scattered to the four corners of Paris, powerless in the 
  context of their individual preoccupations. The COT sees itself as the only 
  possible link between them, as the divinely ordained vehicle for the expression 
  of their collective viii. The 'Mouvement du 22 Mars', on the other hand, had 
  issued a call to the students and workers, asking them to stick together and 
  to proceed to the lawns of the Champ de Mars (at the foot of the Eiffel Tower) 
  for a massive collective discussion on the experiences of the day and on the 
  problems that lie ahead. </p>
<p>
  At this stage I sample for the first time what a 'service d'ordre' composed 
  of Stalinist stewards really means. AII day, the stewards have obviously been 
  anticipating this particular moment. They are very tense, clearly expecting 
  'trouble'. Above all else they fear what they call 'd&eacute;bordement', ie 
  being outflanked on the left. For the last half-mile of the march five or six 
  solid rows of them line up on either side of the demonstrators. Arms linked, 
  they form a massive sheath around the marchers. CGT officials address the bottled-up 
  demonstrators through two powerful loudspeakers mounted on vans, instructing 
  them to disperse quietly via the Boulevard Arago, ie to proceed in precisely 
  the opposite direction to the one leading to the Champ de Mars. Other exits 
  from the Place Denfert Rochereau are blocked by lines of stewards linking arms 
  On occasions like this, l am told, the Communist Party calls up thousands of 
  its members from the Paris area. It also summons members from mites around, 
  bringing them up by the coach load from places as far away as Rennes, Orleans, 
  Sens, Lille and Limoges. The municipalities under Communist Party control provide 
  further hundreds of these 'stewards' not necessarily Party members, but people 
  dependent on the goodwill of the Party for their jobs and future. Ever since 
  its heyday of participation in the government (1945-47) the Party has had this 
  kind of mass base in the Paris suburbs. It has invariably used it in circumstances 
  like today. On this demonstration there must be at least 10,000 such stewards, 
  possibly twice that number. The exhortations of the stewards meet with a variable 
  response. Whether they are successful in getting particular groups to disperse 
  via the Boulevard Arago depends of course on the composition of the groups. 
  Most of those which the students have not succeeded in infiltrating obey, although 
  even here some of the younger militants protest: ''We are a million in the streets. 
  Why should we go home?'' Other groups hesitate, vacillate, and start arguing. 
  Student speakers climb on walls and shout: &quot;'AII those who want to return 
  to the telly, turn down the Boulevard Arago. Those who are for joint worker-student 
  discussions and for developing the struggle, turn down the Boulevard Raspail 
  and proceed to the Champ de Mars''. Those protesting against the dispersion 
  orders are immediately jumped on by the stewards, denounced as 'provocateurs' 
  and often man-handled. I saw several comrades of the 'Mouvement du 22 Mars' 
  physically assaulted, their portable loud hailers from their hands and their 
  leaflets torn from them and thrown to the ground. In some sections there seemed 
  to be dozens, in others hundreds, in others thousands of 'provocateurs'. A number 
  of minor punch-ups take piece as the stewards are swept aside by these particular 
  contingents. Heated arguments break out, the demonstrators denouncing the Stalinists 
  as 'cops' and as 'the last rampart of the bourgeoisie'.</p>
<p>
  A respect for facts compels me to admit that most contingents followed the orders 
  of the trade union bureaucrats. The repeated slanders by the CGT and Communist 
  Party leaders had had their effect. The students were ''trouble-makers'' ''adventurers'' 
  ''dubious elements''. Their proposed action would only lead to a massive intervention 
  by the CRS' (who had kept well out of sight throughout the whole of the afternoon). 
  &quot;This was just a demonstration, not a prelude to revolutions'' Playing 
  ruthlessly on the most backward sections of the crowd, and physically assaulting 
  the more advanced sections, the apparatchiks of the CGT succeeded in getting 
  the bulk of the demonstrators to disperse, often under protest. Thousands went 
  to the Champ de Mars, But hundreds of thousands went home. The Stalinists won 
  the day, but the arguments started will surely reverberate down the months to 
  come. </p>
<p>
  At about 8pm an episode took place which changed the temper of the last sections 
  of the march, now approaching the dispersal point. A police van suddenly came 
  up one of the streets leading Into the Place Denfert Rochereau. It must have 
  strayed from its intended route, or perhaps its driver had assumed that the 
  demonstrators had already dispersed. Seeing the crowd ahead the two uniformed 
  gendarmes in the front seat panicked. Unable to reverse in time in order to 
  retreat, the driver decided that his life hinged on forcing a passage through 
  the thinnest section of the crowd. The vehicle accelerated: hurling itself into 
  the demonstrators at about 50 mikes an hour. People scattered wildly in alt 
  directions. Several people were knocked down and two were seriously injured. 
  Many more narrowly' escaped, The van was finally surrounded. One of the policemen 
  in the front seat was dragged out and repeatedly punched by the infuriated crowd, 
  determined to lynch him. He was finally rescuers in the nick of time, by the 
  stewards. They more or less carried him, semi-conscious, down a side street 
  where he was passed horizontally, like a battered blood sausage, through an 
  open ground floor window.</p>
<p>
  To do this, the stewards had had to engage in a running fight with several hundred 
  very angry marchers. The crowd then started rocking the stranded police van. 
  The remaining policeman drew his revolver and fired. People ducked. By a miracle 
  no-one was hit. A hundred yards away the bullet made a hole, about three feet 
  above ground level, in a window of 'Le Belfort', a big caf&eacute; at 297 Boulevard 
  Raspail. The stewards again rushed to the rescue, forming a barrier between 
  the crowd and the police van, which was allowed to escape down a side street, 
  driven by the policeman who had fired at the crowd.</p>
<p>
  Hundreds of demonstrators then thronged round the hole in the window of the 
  cafe. Press photographers were summoned, arrived, duly took their close-ups 
  - none of which, of course, were ever published, (Two days later L'Humanit&eacute; 
  carried a few lines about the episode, at the bottom of a column on page 5.) 
  One effect of the episode is that several thousand more demonstrators decided 
  not to disperse. They turned and marched down towards the Champ de Mars, shouting 
  ''lls ont tir&eacute; &agrave; Denfert'' (they've shot at us at Denfert). If 
  the incident had taken place an hour earlier, the evening of 13 May might have 
  had a very different complexion.</p>
<p class="subtitle">
  The Sorbonne Soviet </p>
<p>
  On Saturday 11 May, shortly before midnight, Mr Pompidou, Prime Minister of 
  France, overruled his Minister of the Interior, his Minister of Education, and 
  issued orders to his 'independent' Judiciary. He announced that the police would 
  be withdrawn from the Latin Quarter, that the faculties would re-open on Monday 
  13 May, and that the law would 'reconsider' the question of the students arrested 
  the previous week. It was the biggest political climb-down of his career: For 
  the students, and for many others, it was the living proof that direct action 
  worked. Concessions had been won through struggle which had been unobtainable 
  by other means. Early on the Monday morning the CRS platoons guarding the entrance 
  to the Sorbonne were discreetly withdrawn. The students moved in, first in small 
  groups, then in hundreds, later in thousands. By midday the occupation was complete. 
  Every 'tricolore' was promptly hauled down, every lecture theatre occupied, 
  Red flags were hoisted from the official flagpoles and from improvised ones 
  at many windows, some overlooking the streets, others the big internal courtyard. 
  Hundreds of feet above the milling students, enormous red and black flags fluttered 
  side by side from the Chapel dome, What happened over the next few days will 
  leave a permanent mark on the French educational system, on the structure of 
  French society and - most important of all - on the minds of those who lived 
  and made history during that hectic first fortnight. The Sorbonne was suddenly 
  transformed from the fusty precinct where French capitalism selected and molded 
  its hierarchs, its technocrats and its administrative bureaucracy into a revolutionary 
  volcano in full eruption whose lava was to spread far and wide, searing the 
  social structure of modern France.</p>
<p>
  The physical occupation of the Sorbonne was followed by an intellectual explosion 
  of unprecedented violence. Everything, literally everything, was suddenly and 
  simultaneously up for discussion, for question, for challenge. There were no 
  taboos. It is easy to criticize the chaotic upsurge of thoughts, ideas and proposals 
  unleashed in such circumstances. 'Professional revolutionaries' and petty bourgeois 
  philistines criticized to their heart's content. But in so doing they only revealed 
  how they themselves were trapped in the ideology of a previous epoch and were 
  incapable of transcending it. They failed to recognize the tremendous significance 
  of the new: of all that could not be apprehended within their own pre-established 
  intellectual categories. The phenomenon was witnessed again and again, as it 
  doubtless has been in every really great upheaval in history. </p>
<p>
  Day and night, every lecture theatre was packed out, the seat of continuous, 
  passionate debate on every subject that ever preoccupied thinking humanity. 
  No formal lecturer ever enjoyed so massive an audience, was ever listened to 
  with such rapt attention - or given such short shrift if he talked nonsense. 
  A kind of order rapidly prevailed. By the second day a notice board had appeared 
  near the front entrance announcing what was being talked about, and where. l 
  noted'. 'Organization of the struggle'; 'Political and trade union rights in 
  the University'; 'University crisis or social crisis?'. 'Dossier of police repression'; 
  'Self-management'; 'Non-selection' (or how to open the doors of the University 
  to everyone); 'Methods of teaching'; 'Exams', etc. Other lecture theatres were 
  given over to the students-workers liaison committees, soon to 'assume great 
  importance. In yet other hales, discussions were under way on 'sexual repression', 
  on 'the colonial question', on 'ideology and mystification', and Any group of 
  people wishing to discuss anything under the sun would just take over one of 
  the lecture theatres or smaller rooms. Fortunately there were dozens of these. 
  The first impression was of a gigantic lid suddenly lifted, of pent-up thoughts 
  and aspirations suddenly exploding, on being released from the realm of dreams 
  into the realm of the real and the possible. In changing their environment people 
  themselves were changed. Those who had never dared say anything suddenly felt 
  their thoughts to be the most important thing in the world and said so. The 
  shy became communicative. The helpless and isolated suddenly discovered that 
  collective power lay in their hands. The traditionally apathetic suddenly realized 
  the intensity of their involvement. A tremendous surge of community and cohesion 
  gripped those who had previously seen themselves as isolated and impotent puppets, 
  dominated by institutions that they could neither control nor understand. People 
  just went up and talked to one another without a trace of self-consciousness. 
  This state of euphoria lasted throughout the whole fortnight I was there, An 
  inscription scrawled on a wall sums it up perfectly'. 'D&eacute;j&agrave; dix 
  jours de bonheur' (ten days of happiness already). </p>
<p>
  In the yard of the Sorbonne, politics (frowned on for a generation) took over 
  with a vengeance. Literature stalls sprouted up along the whole inner perimeter, 
  Enormous portraits appeared on the internal walls: Marx, Lenin, Trotsky, Mao, 
  Castro, Guevara, a revolutionary resurrection breaking the bounds of time and 
  place. Even Stalin put in a transient appearance (above a Maoist stall) until 
  it was tactfully suggested to the comrades that he wasn't really at home in 
  such company. </p>
<p>
  On the stalls themselves every kind of literature suddenly blossomed forth in 
  the summer sunshine: leaflets and pamphlets by anarchists, Stalinists, Maoists, 
  Trotskyists (three varieties), the PSU and the non-committed. The yard of the 
  Sorbonne had become a gigantic revolutionary drug-store, in which the most esoteric 
  products no longer had to be kept beneath the counter but could now be prominently 
  displayed. Old issues of journals, yellowed by the years, were unearthed and 
  often sold as well as more recent material. Everywhere there were groups of 
  1 0 or 20 people, in heated discussion, people talking about the barricades, 
  about the CRST about their own experiences, but also about the commune of 1871 
  , about 1905 and 1917, about the Italian left in 1921 and About France in 1936. 
  A fusion was taking place between the consciousness Of the revolutionary minorities 
  and the consciousness of whole new layers Of people, dragged day by day into 
  the maelstrom of political controversy. The students were learning within days 
  what it had taken others a lifetime to learn. Many lichens came to see What 
  it was all about. They too got sucked into the vortex. I remember a boy of 14 
  explaining to an incredulous man of 60 why students should have the right to 
  depose professors. </p>
<p>
  Other things also happened. A large piano suddenly appeared In the great central 
  yard and remained there for several days. People would come and play on it, 
  surrounded by enthusiastic supporters. As people talked in the lecture theatres 
  of nee-capitalism and Of its techniques of manipulation, strands of Chopin and 
  bars of jazz, bits of La Carmagnole and atonal compositions wafted through the 
  air. One evening there was a drum recital, then some clarinet players took over. 
  These 'diversions' may have infuriated some of the more single-minded revolutionaries, 
  but they were as much part and parcel of the total transformation of the Sorbonne 
  as were the revolutionary doctrines being proclaimed in the lecture hails. An 
  exhibition of huge photographs of the 'night of the barricades' (in beautiful 
  half-tones) appeared one morning, mounted on stands. No-tine knew who had put 
  it up. Everyone agreed that it succinctly summarized the horror and glamour, 
  the anger and promise of that fateful night. Even the doors of the Chapel giving 
  on to the yard were soon covered with inscriptions: 'open this door - Finis, 
  le tabernacles&#8217;, &#8216;Religion is the last mystification'. Or more prosaically: 
  'We want somewhere to piss, not somewhere to pray'. The massive outer walls 
  of the Sorbonne were likewise soon plastered with posters - posters announcing 
  the first sit-in strikes, posters describing the wage rates of whole sections 
  of Paris workers, posters announcing the next demonstrations, posters describing 
  the solidarity marches in Peking, posters denouncing the police repression and 
  the use of CS gas (as well as of ordinary tear-gas) against the demonstrators. 
  There were posters, dozens of them, and warning students against the Communist 
  Party's band-wagon jumping tactics, telling them how it had attacked their movement 
  and how it was now seeking to assume its leadership. Political posters in plenty. 
  But also others, proclaiming the new ethos. A big one for instance near the 
  main entrance, boldly proclaimed 'D&eacute;fense d'interdire' (Forbidding forbidden). 
  And others, equally to the point: 'Only the truth is revolutionary', 'Our revolution 
  is greater than ourselves', 'We refuse the role assigned to us, will not be 
  trained as police dogs'. People's concerns varied but converged. The posters 
  reflected the deeply libertarian prevailing philosophy: 'Humanity will only 
  be happy when the last capitalist has been strangled with the guts of the last 
  bureaucrat'', 'Culture is disintegrating. Create!&#8217;, &#8216;I take my wishes 
  for reality for I believe in the reality of my wishes'; or more simply, 'Creativity, 
  spontaneity, life'. In the street outside, hundreds of passers-by would stop 
  to read these improvised wall-newspapers. Some gaped. Some snickered, some nodded 
  assent. Some argued, Some, summoning their courage: actually entered the erstwhile 
  sacrosanct premises, as they were being exhorted to by numerous posters proclaiming 
  that the Sorbonne was now open to all, Young workers who 'wouldn't have been 
  seen in that place' a month ago now walked in groups, at first rather self-consciously, 
  later as if they owned the place, which of course they did. </p>
<p>
  As the days went by, another kind of invasion took place -- the invasion by 
  the cynical and the unbelieving, or - more charitably - by those who 'had only 
  come to see'. It gradually gained momentum. At certain stages it threatened 
  to paralyze the serious work being done, part of which had to be hived off to 
  the Faculty of Letters, at Censing, also occupied by the students. It was felt 
  necessary, however, for the doors to be kept open, 24 hours a day. The message 
  certainly spread. Deputations came first from other universities, then from 
  high schools, later from factories and offices, to look, to question, to argue, 
  to study. </p>
<p>
  The most telling sign, however, of the new and heady climate was to be found 
  on the wails of the Sorbonne corridors. Around the main lecture theatres there 
  is a maze of such corridors', dark, dusty, depressing, and hitherto unnoticed 
  passageways leading from nowhere in particular to nowhere else. Suddenly these 
  corridors sprang to life in a firework of luminous mural wisdom - much of it 
  of Situationist inspiration. Hundreds of people suddenly stopped to read such 
  pearls as: 'Do not consume Marx. Live it'; 'The future will only contain what 
  we put into it now'; 'When examined. we will answer with questions'', 'Professors, 
  you make us feel old' ; 'One doesn't compose with a society in decomposition'', 
  'We must remain the unadapted ones'; 'Workers of all lands, enjoy yourselves' 
  : 'Those who carry out a revolution only half-way through merely dig themselves 
  a tomb (St Just), 'Please leave the PC (Communist Party) as clean on leaving 
  as you would like to find it on entering '; 'The tears of the philistines are 
  the nectar of the gods',' 'GO and die in Naples. with the Club Mediterran&eacute;e'; 
  'Long live communication, down with telecommunication' ' 'Masochism today dresses 
  up as reformism ; We will claim nothing. We will ask for nothing. We will take. 
  We will occupy'; 'The only outrage to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier was the 
  outrage that put him there'', 'No, we won't be picked up by the Great Party 
  of the Working Class', And a big inscription, well displayed'. 'Since 1936 l 
  have fought for wage increases, My father, before me, also fought for wage increases. 
  Now I have a telly, a fridge, a Volkswagen. Yet all in all, my life has always 
  been a dog's life. Don't discuss with the bosses. Eliminate them.' </p>
<p>
  Day after day the courtyard and corridors are crammed, the scene of an incessant 
  bi-directional flow to every conceivable part of the enormous building. It may 
  look like chaos, but it is the chaos of a beehive or of an anthill. A new structure 
  is gradually being evolved. A canteen has been organized in one big hall, people 
  pay what they can afford for glasses of orange juice, 'menthe', or 'grenadine' 
  and for ham or sausage rolls. l enquire whether costs are covered and am toad 
  they more or less break even. In another part of the building a children's cr&egrave;che 
  has been set up, elsewhere a first-aid station, elsewhere a dormitory. Regular 
  sweeping-up rotas are organized. Rooms are allocated to the Occupation Committee, 
  to the Press Committee, to the Propaganda Committee, to the student- worker 
  liaison committees, to the committees dealing with foreign students, to the 
  action committees of Lyceens, to the committees dealing with the allocation 
  of premises, and to the numerous commissions undertaking special projects such 
  as the compiling of a dossier on police atrocities, the study of the implications 
  of autonomy, of the examination system, etc. Anyone seeking work can readily 
  find it. The composition of the committees was very variable. It often changed 
  from day to day, as the committees gradually found their feel. To those who 
  pressed for instant solutions to every problem it would be answered: &quot;patience, 
  comrade give us a chance to evolve an alternative. The bourgeoisie has controlled 
  this university for nearly two centuries. It has solved nothing. We are building 
  from rock bottom, We need a month or two...'' </p>
<p>
  Confronted with this tremendous explosion which it had neither foreseen nor 
  been able to control the Communist Party tried desperately to salvage what it 
  could of its shattered reputation. Between 3 May and 13 May every issue of L'Humanit&eacute; 
  had carried paragraphs either attacking the students or making slimy innuendoes 
  about them. Now the line suddenly changed, The Party sent dozens of its best 
  agitators into the Sorbonne to 'explain' its case. The case was a simple one. 
  The Party 'supported the students' - even if there were a few 'dubious elements' 
  in their leadership. It 'always had'. It always would. Amazing scenes followed. 
  Every Stalinist 'agitator' would immediately be surrounded by a large group 
  of well-informed young people, denouncing the Party's counter-revolutionary 
  role. A wall-paper had been put up by the comrades of Vol&agrave; Ouvri&egrave;re 
  on which had been posted, day by day, every statement attacking the students 
  to have appeared in L'Humanite- or in any of a dozen Party leaflets. The 'agitators' 
  couldn't get a word in edgeways. They would be jumped on (non-violently). ''The 
  evidence was over there, comrade. Would the Party comrades like to come and 
  read just exactly what the Party had been saying not a week ago? Perhaps L'Humanit&eacute; 
  would like to grant the students space to reply to some of the accusations made 
  against them?'' Others in the audience would then bring up the Party's role 
  during the Algerian War, during the miners' strike of 1958, during the years 
  of 'tripartisme' (1945-1947). Wriggle as they tried, the 'agitators' just could 
  not escape this kind of 'instant education'. It was interesting to note that 
  the Party could not entrust this 'salvaging' operation to its younger, student 
  members. Only the 'older comrades' could safely venture into this hornets' nest. 
  So much so that people would say that anyone in the Sorbonne over the age of 
  40 was either a copper's nark or a Stalinist stooge. The most dramatic periods 
  of the occupation were undoubtedly the 'Assembl&eacute;es G&eacute;n&eacute;rales', 
  or plenary sessions, held every' night in the giant amphitheatre. This was the 
  soviet, the ultimate source of all decisions, the fount and origin of direct 
  democracy. The amphitheatre could seat up to 5000 people in its enormous hemicycle, 
  surmounted by three balcony tiers. As often as not every seat was taken and 
  the crowd would flow up the aisles and onto the podium, A black flag and a red 
  one hung over the simple wooden table at which the chairman sat. Having seen 
  meetings of 50 break up in chaos it is an amazing experience to see a meeting 
  of 5000 get down to business. Real events determined the themes and ensured 
  that most of the talk was down to earth. </p>
<p>
  The topic having been decided, everyone was allowed to speak. Most speeches 
  were made from the podium but some from the body of the hall or from the balconies. 
  The loudspeaker equipment usually worked but sometimes didn't. Some speakers 
  could command immediate attention, without even raising their voice. Others 
  would instantly provoke a hostile response by the stridency of their tone, their 
  insincerity or their more or less obvious attempts at maneuvering the assembly. 
  Anyone who waffled, or reminisced, or came to recite a set-piece, or talked 
  in terms of slogans, was given shod shrift by the audience, politically the 
  most sophisticated I have ever seen. Anyone making practical suggestions was 
  listened to attentively. So were those who sought to interpret the movement 
  in terms of its own experience or to point the way ahead. </p>
<p>
  Most speakers were granted three minutes, Some were allowed much more by popular 
  acclaim. The crowd itself exerted a tremendous control on the platform and on 
  the speakers. A two-way relationship emerged very quickly. The political maturity 
  of the Assembly was shown most strikingly in its rapid realization that booing 
  or cheering during speeches slowed down the Assembly's own deliberations. Positive 
  speeches were loudly cheered - at the end. Demagogic or useless ones were impatiently 
  swept aside, Conscious revolutionary minorities played an important catalytic 
  role in these deliberations, but never sought - at least the more intelligent 
  ones - to impose their will on the mass body. Although in the early stages the 
  Assembly had its fair share of exhibited nests, provocateurs and nuts, the overhead 
  costs of direct democracy were not as heavy as one might have expected. </p>
<p>
  There were moments of excitement and moments of exhortation. On the night of 
  13 May, after the massive march through the streets of Paris, Daniel Cohn-Bandit 
  confronted J M Catala, general secretary of the Union of Communist Students 
  in front of the packed auditorium. The scene remains printed in my mind. ''Explain 
  to us'', Cohn-Bandit said, ''why the Communist Party and the CGT told their 
  militants to disperse at Denfed Rochereau, why it prevented them joining up 
  with us for a discussion at the Champ de Mars?'' &quot;simple, really'' sneered 
  Catala. ''The agreement concluded between the CGT, the CFDT, the UNEF and the 
  other sponsoring organizations stipulated that dispersal would take place at 
  a predetermined place. The Joint Sponsoring Committee had not sanctioned any 
  further developments...'' ''A revealing answer'', replied Cohn-Bandit, ''the 
  organizations hadn't foreseen that we would be a million in the streets. But 
  life is bigger than the organizations. With a million people almost anything 
  is possible. You say the Committee hadn't sanctioned anything further. On the 
  day of the Revolution, comrade, you will doubtless tell us to forego it 'because 
  it hasn't been sanctioned by the appropriate sponsoring committee'...'' </p>
<p>
  This brought the house down. The only ones who didn't rise to cheer were a few 
  dozen Stalinists. Also, revealingly, those Trotskyists who tacitly accepted 
  the Stalinist conceptions - and whose only quarrel with the CP is that it had 
  excluded them from being one of the 'sponsoring organizations'. That same night 
  the Assembly took three important decisions. From now on the Sorbonne would 
  constitute itself as a revolutionary headquarters ('Smolny', someone shouted). 
  Those who worked there would devote their main efforts not to a mere re-organization 
  of the educational system, but to a total subversion of bourgeois society. From 
  now on the University would be open to all those who subscribed to these aims. 
  The proposals having been accepted the audience rose to a man and sang the loudest, 
  most impassioned 'Internationale' I have ever heard. The echoes must have reverberated 
  as far as the Elysee Palace on the other side of the River Seine...</p>
<p class="subtitle">
  The Censier revolutionaries </p>
<p>
  At the same time as the students occupied the Sorbonne, they also took over 
  the 'Centre Censier' (the new Paris University Faculty of Letters). Censier 
  is an enormous, ultra-modern, steel-concrete-and-glass affair situated at the 
  south-east corner of the Latin Quarter, Its occupation attracted less attention 
  than did that of the Sorbonne. It was to prove, however, just as significant 
  an event. For while the Sorbonne was the shop window of revolutionary Paris 
  - with art that that implies in terms of garish display-, Censier was its dynamo, 
  the place where things really got done. </p>
<p>
  To many, the Paris May Days must have seen an essentially nocturnal affair: 
  nocturnal battles with the CRS, nocturnal barricades, and nocturnal debates 
  in the great amphitheaters. But this was but one side of the coin. While some 
  argued late into the Sorbonne night? others went to bed early for in the mornings 
  they would be handing out leaflets at factory gales or in the suburbs, leaflets 
  that had to be drafted, typed, duplicated, and the distribution of which had 
  to be carefully organized. This patient, systematic work was done at Censier. 
  It contributed in no small measure to giving the new revolutionary consciousness 
  articulate expression. </p>
<p>
  Soon after Censier had been occupied a group of activists commandeered a large 
  part of the third floor. This space was to be the headquarters of their proposed 
  'worker-student action committees'. The general idea was to establish links 
  with groups of workers, however small: who shared the general libertarian- revolutionary 
  outlook of this group of students. Contact having been made, workers and students 
  would cc-operate in the joint drafting of leaflets. The leaflets would discuss 
  the immediate problems of particular groups of workers, but in the light of 
  what the students had shown to be possible. A given leaflet would then be jointly 
  distributed by workers and students, outside the navicular factory or office 
  to which it referred, In some instances the distribution would have to be undertaken 
  by students alone, in others hardly a single student would be needed, What brought 
  the Censing comrades together was a deeply-felt sense of the revolutionary potentialities 
  of the situation and the knowledge that they had no time to waste. They all 
  felt the pressing need for direct action propaganda, and that the urgency of 
  the situation required of them that they transcend any doctrinal differences 
  they might have with one another. They were all intensely' political people. 
  By and large, their politics were those of that new and increasingly important 
  historical species: the ex- members of one or other revolutionary organization. 
  </p>
<p>
  What were their views? Basically they boiled down to a few simple propositions. 
  What was needed just now was a rapid, autonomous development of the working 
  class struggle, the setting up of elected strike committees which would link 
  union and non-union members in all strike-bound. plants and enterprises, regular 
  meetings of the strikers so that the fundamental decisions remained in the hands 
  of the rank and file, workers' defense committees to defend pickets from police 
  intimidation, a constant dialogue with the revolutionary students aimed at restoring 
  to the working class its own tradition of direct democracy and its own aspiration 
  to self-management (auto- gestion), usurped by the bureaucracies of the trade 
  unions and the political parties, For a whole week the various Trotskyist and 
  Maoist factions didn't even notice what was going on at Censier. They spent 
  their time in public and often acrimonious debates at the Sorbonne as to who 
  could provide the best leadership. Meanwhile, the comrades at Censier were steadily 
  getting on with the work. The majority of them had 'been through' either Stalinist 
  or Trotskyist organizations. They had left behind them all ideas to the effect 
  that 'intervention' was meaningful only in terms of potential recruitment to 
  their own particular group. All recognized the need for a widely-based and moderately 
  structured revolutionary movement, but none of them saw the building of such 
  a movement as an immediate, all important task, on which propaganda should immediately 
  be centered. </p>
<p>
  Duplicators belonging to 'subversive elements' were brought in. University duplicators 
  were commandeered. Stocks of paper and ink were obtained from various sources 
  and by various means. Leaflets began to pour out. first in hundreds, then in 
  thousands, then in tens of thousands as links were established with one group 
  of rank and file workers after another, On the first day alone, Renault, Citroen, 
  Air France, Boussac, the Nouvelles Messageries de Presse, Rhone- Poulenc and 
  the RATP (M&eacute;tro) were contacted. The movement then snowballed. </p>
<p>
  Every evening at Censier, the action committees reported back to an 'Assembl&eacute;e 
  G&eacute;n&eacute;rale' devoted exclusively to this kind of work. The reactions 
  to the distribution were assessed, the content of future leaflets discussed. 
  These discussions would usually be led off by the worker contact who would describe 
  the impact of the leaflet on his workmates. The most heated discussion centered 
  on whether direct attacks should be made on the leaders of the CGT or whether 
  mere suggestions as to what was needed to win would be sufficient to expose 
  everything the union leaders had (or hadn't) done and everything they stood 
  for. The second viewpoint prevailed. The leaflets were usually very short, never 
  more than 200 or 300 words. They nearly ail started by listing the workers' 
  grievances - or just by describing their conditions of work. They would end 
  by inviting workers to call at Censier or at the Sorbonne. &quot;These places 
  are now yours, Come there to discuss your problems with others. Take a hand 
  yourselves in making known your problems and demands to those around you.'' 
  Between this kind of opening and this kind of conclusion, most leaflets contained 
  one or two key political points. The response was instantaneous. More and more 
  workers dropped in to draft joint leaflets with the students. Soon there was 
  no lecture room big enough for the daily 'Assembl&eacute;e G&eacute;n&eacute;rale'. 
  The students learned a great deal from the workers' self-discipline and from 
  the systematic way in which they presented their reports. It was all so different 
  from the 'in-fighting' of the political sects. There was agreement that these 
  were the finest lectures held at Censier! </p>
<p>
  Among the more telling lines of these leaflets, I noted the following', Air 
  France leaflet ''We refuse to accept a degrading 'modernization' which means 
  we are constantly watched and have to submit to conditions which are harmful 
  to our health, to our nervous systems and an insult to our status of human beings... 
  We refuse to entrust our demands any longer to professional trade union leaders. 
  Like the students, we must take the control of our affairs into our own hands.'' 
  Renault leaflet &quot;If we want our wage increases and our claims concerning 
  conditions of work to be secure, if we don't want them constantly threatened, 
  we must now struggle for a fundamental change in society... As workers we should 
  ourselves seek to control the operation of our enterprises. Our objectives are 
  similar to those of the students. The management (gestion) of industry and the 
  management of the university should be democratically ensured by those who work 
  there...'' Rhone-Poulenc leaflet ''Up till now we tried to solve our problems 
  through petitions, partial struggles, the election of better leaders. This has 
  led us nowhere. The action of the students has shown us that only rank and file 
  action could compel the authorities to retreat... the students are challenging 
  the whole purpose of bourgeois education. They want to take the fundamental 
  decisions themselves. So should we. We should decide the purpose of production, 
  and at whose cost production will be carried out.'' District leaflet (distributed 
  in the streets at Boulogne-Billancourt) ''The government fears the extension 
  of the movement. It fears the developing unity between workers and students. 
  Pompidou has announced that &quot;the government will defend the Republic. The 
  Army and police are being prepared, De Gaulle will speak on the 24th. Will he 
  send the CRS to clear pickets out of strikebound plants? Be prepared. In workshops 
  and faculties, think in terms of self- defense,..'' Every day dozens of such 
  leaflets were discussed, typed, duplicated, and distributed. Every evening we 
  heard of the response: ''The blokes think it's tremendous. It's just what they 
  are thinking. The union officials never talk like this''. ''The blokes liked 
  the leaflet. They are skeptical about the 12%. They say prices will go up and 
  that we'll lose it all in a few months. Some say let's push all together now 
  and take on the lot,'' ''The leaflet certainly staged the lads talking. They've 
  never had so much to say. The officials had to wait their turn to speak...'' 
  </p>
<p>
  I vividly remember a young printing worker who said one night that these meetings 
  were the most exciting thing that had ever happened to him. AII his life he 
  had dreamed of meeting people who thought and spoke like this. But every time 
  he thought he had met one all they were interested in was what they could get 
  out of him. This was the first time he had been offered disinterested help. 
  I don't know what has happened at Censier since the end of May. When I left, 
  sundry Trots were beginning to move in, ''to politicize the leaflets'' (by which 
  I presume they meant that the leaflets should now talk about &quot;the need 
  to build the revolutionary Party''). If they succeed - which I doubt, knowing 
  the caliber of the Censier comrades - it will be a tragedy. </p>
<p>
  The leaflets were in fact political. During the whole of my short stay in France 
  I saw nothing more intensely and relevantly political (in the best sense of 
  the term) than the sustained campaign emanating from Censier, a campaign for 
  constant control of the struggle from below, for self-defense, for workers' 
  management of production, for popularizing the concept of workers' councils, 
  for explaining to one and all the tremendous relevance, in a revolutionary situation, 
  of revolutionary demands, of organized self-activity, of collective self-reliance. 
  </p>
<p>
  As I left Censier I could not help thinking how the place epitomized the crisis 
  of modern bureaucratic capitalism. Censier is no educational slum. It is an 
  ultra-modern building, one of the showpieces of Gaullist 'grandeur'. It has 
  closed-circuit television in the lecture theatres, modern plumbing, and slot 
  machines distributing 24 different kinds of food ,in sterilized containers and 
  10 different kinds of drink. Over 90% of the students there are of petty bourgeois 
  or bourgeois backgrounds. Yet such is their rejection of the society that nurtured 
  them that they were working duplicators 24 hours a day, turning out a flood 
  of revolutionary literature of a kind no modern city has ever had pushed into 
  it before. This kind of activity had transformed these students and had contributed 
  to transforming the environment around them. They were simultaneously disrupting 
  the social structure and having the time of their lives. In the words of a slogan 
  scrawled on the wall: 'On n'est pas If pour s'emmerder' (you'll have to look 
  this one up in the dictionary).</p>
<p class="subtitle">
  Getting together </p>
<p>
  When the news of the first factory occupation (that of the Sud-Aviation plant 
  at Nantes) reached the Sorbonne - late during the night of Tuesday 14 May - 
  there were scenes of indescribable enthusiasm. Sessions were interrupted for 
  the announcement. Everyone seemed to sense the significance of what had just 
  happened. After a full minute of continuous, delirious cheering, the audience 
  broke into a synchronous, rhythmical clapping, apparently reserved for great 
  occasions. </p>
<p>
  On Thursday 16 May the Renault factories at Cl&eacute;on (near Rouen) and at 
  Flins (North West of Paris) were occupied. Excited groups in the Sorbonne yard 
  remained glued to their transistors as hour by hour news came over of further 
  occupations. Enormous posters were put up, both inside and outside the Sorbonne, 
  with the most up-to-date information of which factories had been occupied: the 
  Nouvelles Messageries de Presse in Paris, Kl&eacute;ber Colombes at Caudebec, 
  Dresser-Dujardin at Le Havre, the naval shipyard at Le Trait...and finally the 
  Renault works at Boulogne-Billancourt. Within 48 hours the task had to be abandoned. 
  No notice board - or panel of notice boards - was large enough. At last the 
  students felt that the battle had really been joined. </p>
<p>
  Early on the Friday afternoon an emergency 'General Assembly' was held. The 
  meeting decided to send a big student deputation to the occupied Renault works. 
  lts aim was to establish contact, express student solidarity and, if possible, 
  discuss common problems. The march was scheduled to leave the Place de la Sorbonne 
  at 6pm. At about 5pm thousands of leaflets were suddenly distributed in the 
  amphitheaters, in the Sorbonne yard and in the streets around. They were signed 
  by the Renault Bureau Of the CGT. The Communist Party had been working...fast. 
  The leaflets read: ''We have just heard that students and teachers are proposing 
  to set out this afternoon in the direction of Renault. This decision was taken 
  without consulting the appropriate trade union sections of the CGT, CFDT and 
  FO. ''We greatly appreciate the solidarity of the students and teachers in the 
  common struggle against the 'pouvoir personnel' (ie de Gaulle) and the employers. 
  but are opposed to any ill-judged initiative which might threaten our developing 
  movement and facilitate a provocation which would lead to a diversion by the 
  government. We strongly advise the organizers of this demonstration against 
  proceeding with their plans. ''We intend, together with the workers now struggling 
  for their claims, to lead our own strike. We refuse any external intervention, 
  in conformity with the declaration jointly signed by the CGT, CFDT and FO unions, 
  and approved this morning by 23,000 workers belonging to the factory.''</p>
<p>
  The distortion and dishonesty of this leaflet defy description. No-one intended 
  to instruct the workers how to run the strike and no student would have the 
  presumption to seek to assume its leadership. All that the students wanted was 
  to express solidarity with the workers in what was now a common struggle against 
  the state and the employing class. </p>
<p>
  The CGT leaflet came like an icy shower to the less political students and to 
  all those who still had illusions about Stalinism. ''They won't let us get through.'' 
  ''The workers don't want to talk with us.'' The identification of workers with 
  'their' organizations is very hard to break down. Several hundred who had intended 
  to march to Billancourt were probably put off, The UNEF vacillated, reluctant 
  to lead the march in direct violation of the wishes of the CGT. Finally some 
  1500 people set out, under a single banner, hastily prepared by some Maoist 
  students. The banner proclaimed 'The strong hands of the working class must 
  now take over the torch from the fragile hands of the students'. Many joined 
  the march who were not Maoists and who didn't necessarily agree with this particular 
  formulation of its objectives. </p>
<p>
  Although small when compared to other marches, this was certainly a most political 
  one. Practically everyone on it belonged to one or other of the 'groupuscules': 
  a spontaneous united front of Maoists, Trotskyists, anarchists, the comrades 
  of the Mouvement du 22 Mars and various others. Everyone knew exactly what he 
  was doing. It was this that was so to infuriate the Communist Party. The march 
  sets off noisily, crosses the Boulevard St Michel, and passes in front of the 
  occupied Odeon Theatre (where several hundred more joyfully join it). It then 
  proceeds at a very brisk pace down the rue de Vauguard, the longest street in 
  Paris, towards the working class districts to the South West of the city, growing 
  steadily in size and militancy as it advances. It is important we reach the 
  factory before the Stalinists have time to mobilize their big battalions... 
  </p>
<p>
  Slogans such as ''Avec nous, chez Renault'' (come with us to Renault), ''Le 
  pouvoir est dans la rue'' (power lies in the street), Le pouvoir aux ouvriers'' 
  (power to the workers) are shouted lustily, again and again. The Maoists shout 
  ''A b&agrave;s Ie gouvernement gaulliste anti-populaire de chomage et de mis&egrave;re'' 
  - a long and 'politically equivocal slogan, but one eminently suited to collective 
  shouting. The Internationals bursts out repeatedly, sung this time by people 
  who seem to know the words - even the second verse! By the time we have marched 
  the five milks to Issy-les-Moulineaux it is already dark. Way behind us now 
  are the bright lights of the Latin Quarter and of the fashionable Paris known 
  to tourists. We go through small, poorly-lit streets, the uncollected rubbish 
  piled high In places. Dozens of young people join us en route, attracted by 
  the noise and the singing of revolutionary songs such as 'La Jeune Garde', 'Zimmerwald', 
  and the song of the Partisans, ''chez Renault, chez Renault'' the marchers shout. 
  People congregate in the doors of the bistros, or peer out of the windows of 
  crowded fiats to watch us pass. Some look on in amazement but many - possibly 
  a majority - now''' clap or wave encouragement. In some streets many Algerians 
  fine the pavement. Some join in the shouting of CSCRS - SS''' &quot;Charonne''' 
  ''A b&agrave;s I'Etat policier'' They have not forgotten. Most look on shyly 
  or smile in an embarrassed way. Very few join the march. </p>
<p>
  On we go, a few miles more. There isn't a gendarme in sight. We cross the Seine 
  and eventually stow down as we approach a square beyond which lie the Renault 
  works. The streets here arc very badly-lit. There is a sense of intense excitement 
  in the air. We suddenly come up against a lorry, parked across most of the road, 
  and fitted with loudspeaker equipment. The march stops. On the lorry stands 
  a CGT official. He speaks for five minutes. In somewhat chilly tones he says 
  how pleased he is to see us. ''Thank you for coming, comrades. We appreciate 
  your solidarity. But please no provocations. Don't go too near the gated as 
  the management would use it as an excuse to call the police. And go home soon. 
  lt's cold and you'll need all your strength in the days to come.'' The students 
  have brought their own loud hailers. One or two speak, briefly. They take note 
  of the comments of the comrade from the CGT. They have no intention of provoking 
  anyone, no wish to usurp anyone's functions, We then slowly but quite deliberately 
  move forwards into the square, on each side of the lorry, drowning the protests 
  of about a hundred Stalinists in a powerful 'lnternationale'. Workers in neighboring 
  cafes come out and join us. This time the Party had not had time to mobilize 
  its militants. It could not physically isolate us. </p>
<p>
  Part of the factory now looms up right ahead of us, three stories high on our 
  left, two stories high on our right, In front of us, there is a giant metal 
  gate, closed and bolted. A large first floor window to our right is crowded 
  with workers. The front row sit with their legs dangling over the sill. Several 
  seem in their teens', one of them waves a big red flag. There are no 'tricolores' 
  in sight - no ideal allegiance' as in other occupied places I had seen. Several 
  dozen more workers are on the roofs of the two buildings. We wave. They wave 
  back. We sing the 'Internationale'. They join in. We give the clenched fist 
  salute. They do likewise. Everybody cheers. Contact has been made. An interesting 
  exchange takes place. A group of demonstrators stabs shouting &quot;Les usines 
  aux ouvriers'' (the factories to the workers). The slogan spreads like wildfire 
  through the crowd. The Maoists, now in a definite minority, are rather annoyed. 
  (According to Chairman Mao, workers' control is a petty-bourgeois, anarcho-syndicalist 
  deviation.) &quot;les usines aux ouvriers''..10, 20 times the slogan reverberates 
  round the Place Nationals, taken up by a crowd now some 3000 strong. </p>
<p>
  As the shouting subsides, a lone voice from one of the Renault roofs shouts 
  back'. ''La Sorbonne aux Etudiants''. Other workers on the same roof take it 
  up. Then those on the other roof. By the volume of their voices they must be 
  at beast 100 of them, on top of each building. There is then a moment of silence. 
  Everyone thinks the exchange has come to an end. But one of the demonstrators 
  starts chanting'. ''La Sorbonne aux ouvriers''. Amid general laughter, everyone 
  joins in. </p>
<p>
  We start talking. A rope is quickly passed down from the window, a bucket at 
  the end of it, Bottles of beer and packets of fags are passed up. Also revolutionary 
  leaflets. Also bundles of papers (mainly copies of Server Ie Peuple - a Maoist 
  journal carrying a big title 'Vive la CGT'). At street level there are a number 
  of gaps in the metal facade of the building. Groups of students cluster at these 
  half-dozen openings and talk to groups of workers on the other side. They discuss 
  wages, conditions, the CRS, what the lads inside need most, and how the students 
  can help. The men talk freely. They are not Party members. They think the constant 
  talk of provocateurs a bit far-fetched. But the machines must be protected. 
  We point out that two or three students inside the factory, escorted by the 
  strike committee, couldn't possibly damage the machines. They agree. We contrast 
  the widely open doors of the Sorbonne with the heavy locks and bolts on the 
  Renault bates - closed by the CGT officials to prevent the ideological contamination 
  of 'their' militants. How silly, we say, to have to talk through these stupid 
  little slits in the wall. </p>
<p>
  Again they agree. They will put it to their 'dirigeants' (leaders), No-one seems, 
  as yet, to think beyond this. There is then a diversion. A hundred yards away 
  a member of the FER gets up on a parked car and starts making a speech through 
  a loud hailer. The intervention is completely out of tune with the dialogue 
  that is just starting. it's the same gramophone record we have been hearing 
  all week at the Sorbonne. ''Call on the union leaders to organism the election 
  of strike committees in every factory. Force the union leaders to federate the 
  strike committees. Force the union leaders to set up a national strike committee. 
  Force them to call a general strike throughout the whole of the country'' (this 
  at a time when millions of workers are already on strike without any call whatsoever). 
  The tone is strident, almost hysterical, the misjudging of the mood monumental. 
  The demonstrators themselves drown the speaker in a loud 'Internationale'. As 
  the last bar fades the Trotskyist tries again. Again the demonstrators drown 
  him, Groups stroll up the Avenue Yves Kermen, to the other entrances to the 
  factory. Real contact is here more difficult to establish. There is a crowd 
  outside the gate, but most of them are Party members. Some won't talk at all, 
  Others just talk slogans. </p>
<p>
  We walk back to the Square. It is now well past midnight. The crowd thins, Groups 
  drop into a couple of cafes which are still open. Here we meet a whole group 
  of young workers, aged about 18, They had been in the factory earlier in the 
  day. They tell us that at any given time, just over 1000 workers are engaged 
  in the occupation. The strike started on the Thursday afternoon, at about 2pm, 
  when the group of youngsters from shop 70 decided to down tools and to spread 
  into all part: of the factory asking their mates to do likewise. That same morning 
  they had heard of the occupation of Cl&eacute;on and that the red flag was floating 
  over the factory at Flins. There had been a lot of talk about what to do. At 
  a midday meeting tile CGT had spoken vaguely of a series of rotating strikes, 
  shop by shop, to be initiated the following day. The movement spread at an incredible 
  pace. The youngsters went round shouting ''Occupation! Occupational''. Half 
  the factory had stopped working before the union officials realized what was 
  happening. At about 4pm, Sylvain, a CGT secretary, had arrived with loudspeaker 
  equipment to tell them ''they weren't numerous enough, to start work again, 
  that they would see tomorrow about a one-day strike''. He is absolutely by-passed. 
  At 5pm Halbeher, general secretary of the Renault CGT, announces, pale as a 
  sheet, that the ''CGT has called for the occupation of the factor''. ''Tell 
  your friends'', the lads say. &quot;We started it. But will we be able to keep 
  it in our hands? C&agrave;, c'est un autre probl&egrave;me...'' </p>
<p>
  Students? Well, hats off to anyone who can thump the cops that hard! The lads 
  tell up two of their mates had disappeared from the factory altogether 10 days 
  ago &quot;to help the Revolution''. Left family, jobs, everything. And good 
  luck to them. &quot;A chance like this comes once in a lifetime.'' We discuss 
  plans, how to develop the movement. The occupied factory could be a ghetto, 
  'isolant Ies durs' (isolating the most militant). We talk about camping, the 
  cinema, the Sorbonne, the future. Almost until sunrise... 'Attention aux provocateurs' 
  </p>
<p>
  Social upheavals, such as the one France has just been through, leave behind 
  them a trail of shattered reputations. The image of Gaullism as a meaningful 
  way of life, 'accepted' by the French people, has taken a tremendous knock. 
  But so has the image of the Communist Party as a viable challenge to the French 
  Establishment, As far as the students are concerned the recent actions of the 
  PCF (Parti Communiste Fran&ccedil;ais) are such that the Party has probably 
  sealed its fate in this milieu for a generation to come, Among the workers the 
  effects are more difficult to assess and it would be denature to attempt this 
  assessment. All that can be said is that the effects are sure to be profound 
  although they will probably take some time to express themselves. The proletarian 
  condition itself was for a moment questioned. Prisoners who have had a glimpse 
  of freedom do not readily resume a life sentence. </p>
<p>
  The full implications of the role of the PCF and of the CGT have yet to be appreciated 
  by British revolutionaries, They need above all else to be informed. In this 
  section we will document the role of the PCF to the best of our ability, It 
  is important to realize that for every ounce of shit thrown at the students 
  in its official publications, the Party poured tons more over them at meetings 
  or in private conversations. In the nature of things it is more difficult to 
  document this kind of slander. </p>
<p class="subtitle">
  Friday 3 May </p>
<p>
  A meeting was called in the yard of the Sorbonne by UNEF, JCR, MAU and FER to 
  protest at the closure of the Nanterre faculty. It was attended by militants 
  of the Mouvement du 22 Mars. The police were called in by Rector Roche and activists 
  from all these groups were arrested. The UEC (Union des Etudiants Communistes) 
  didn't participate in this campaign. But it distributed a leaflet in the Sorbonne 
  denouncing the activity of the 'groupuscules' (abbreviation for 'groupes miniscules', 
  tiny groups). ''The leaders of the leftist groups are taking advantage of the 
  shortcomings of the government. They are exploiting student discontent and trying 
  to stop the functioning of the faculties, They are seeking to prevent the mass 
  of students from working and from passing their exams. These false revolutionaries 
  are acting objectively as allies of the Gaullist power. They are acting as supporters 
  of its policies, which are harmful to the mass of the students and in particular 
  to those of modest origin.'' On the same day L'Humanit&eacute; had written: 
  ''Certain small groups (anarchists, Trotskyists, Maoists) composed mainly of 
  the sons of the big bourgeoisie and led by the German anarchist Cohn-Bandit, 
  are taking advantage of the shortcomings of the government...'' etc... (see 
  above). The same issue of L'Humanit&eacute; had published an article by Marchais, 
  a member of the Party's Central Committee. This article was to be widely distributed, 
  as a leaflet, in factories and offices: </p>
<p>
  Not satisfied with the agitation they are conducting in the student milieu - 
  and agitation which is against the interests of the mass of the students and 
  favors fascist provocateurs - these pseudo- revolutionaries now have the nerve 
  to seek to give lessons to the working class movement. We find them in increasing 
  numbers at the gales of factories and in places where immigrant workers live, 
  distributing leaflets and other propaganda. These false revolutionaries must 
  be unmasked, for objectively they are serving the interests of the Gaullist 
  power and of the big capitalist monopolies.''</p>

  The police have been occupying the Latin Quarter over the weekend. There have 
  been big student street demonstrations. At the call of UNEF and SNESUP 20,000 
  students marched from Denfert Rochereau to St Germain des Pr&eacute;s calling 
  for the liberation of the arrested workers and students. Repeated police assaults 
  on the demonstrators'. 422 arrests, 800 wounded. L'Humanit&eacute; states: one 
  can clearly see today the outcome of the adventurous actions of the leftist, 
  anarchist, Trotskyist and other groups. Objectively they are playing into the 
  hands of the government... The discredit into which they are bringing the student 
  movement is helping feed the violent campaigns of the reactionary press and 
  of the ORTF, who by identifying the actions of these groups with those of the 
  mass of the students are seeking to isolate the students from the mass of the 
  population...''.</p>
<p class="subtitle">
  Tuesday 7 May </p>
<p>
  UNEF and SNESUP call on their supporters to start an unlimited strike. Before 
  discussions with the authorities begin they insist on: ' a. a stop to all legal 
  action against the students and workers who have been questioned, arrested or 
  convicted in the course of the demonstrations of the last few days! b. the withdrawal 
  of the police from the Latin Quaker and from all University premises, c. a reopening 
  of the closed faculties.</p>
<p>
  In a statement showing how completely out of touch they were with the deep motives 
  of the student revolt, the 'Elected Communist Representatives of the Paris region' 
  declared in L'Humanit&eacute;: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> ''The shortage of credits, of premises, of equipment, of teachers...prevent 
    three students out of four from completing their studies, without mentioning 
    all those who never have access to higher education... This situation has 
    caused profound and legitimate discontent among both students and teachers. 
    It has also favored the activity of irresponsible groups whose conceptions 
    can offer no solution to the students' problems. It is intolerable that the 
    government should take advantage of the behavior of an infinitesimal minority 
    to stop the studies of tens of thousands of students a few days from the exams...''. 
    The same issue of L&#8217;Humanit&eacute; carried a statement from the 'Sorbonne-Lettres' 
    (teachers) branch of the Communist Party: ''The Communist teachers demand 
    the liberation of the arrested students and the reopening of the Sorbonne. 
    Conscious of our responsibilities, we specify that this solidarity does not 
    mean that we agree with or support the slogans emanating from certain student 
    organizations. We disapprove of unrealistic, demagogic and anti-communist 
    slogans and of the unwarranted methods of action advocated by various leftist 
    groups.'' </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  On the same day Georges S&eacute;guy, general secretary of the CGT, spoke to 
  the Press about the program of the Festival of Working Class Youth (scheduled 
  for May 17-19, but subsequently cancelled):</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> ''The solidarity between students, teachers and the working class is a familiar 
    notion to the militants of the CGT.., It is precisely this tradition that 
    compels us not to tolerate any dubious or provocative elements, elements which 
    criticize the working class organizations---''.</p>

  A big students' demonstration called by UNEF has taken place in the streets 
  of Paris the previous evening. The front page of L&#8217;Humanit&eacute; carries 
  a statement from the Party Secretariat: </p>
<p>
  ''The discontent of the students is legitimate. But the situation favors adventuring 
  activities, whose conception offers no perspective to the students and has nothing 
  in common with a really progressive and forward-looking policy,'' In the same 
  issue, J M Cabala, general secretary of the UEC (Union des Etudiants Communistes) 
  writes that: ''the actions of irresponsible groups are assisting the Establishment 
  in its aims... What we must do is ask for a bigger educational budget which 
  would ensure bigger student grants, the appointment of more and better qualified 
  teachers, the building of new faculties...''</p>
<p>
  The UJCF (Union des Jeunesses Communistes de France) and the UJFF (Union des 
  Jeunes Filies Fran&ccedil;aises) distribute a leaflet in a number of lycees. 
  L'Humanit&eacute; quotes it approvingly'.. </p>
<p>
  &quot;We protest against the police violence unleashed against the students. 
  We demand the reopening of Nanterre and of the Sorbonne and the liberation of 
  all those arrested. We denounce the Gaullist power as being mainly (!) responsible 
  for this situation. We also denounce the adventuring of certain irresponsible 
  groups and call on the lyc&eacute;ens to fight side by side with the working 
  class and its Communist Party...''.</p>

  Over the weekend Pompidou has climbed down. But the unions, the UNEF and the 
  teachers have decided to maintain their call for a one-day, general strike. 
  On its front page L&#8217;Humanit&eacute; publishes, in enormous headlines, 
  a call for the 24-hour strike followed by a statement from the Political Bureau'. 
  </p>
<p>
  The unity of the working class and of the students threatens the regime... This 
  creates an enormous problem. It is essential that no provocation, no diversion 
  should be allowed to divert any of the forces struggling against the regime 
  or should give the government the flimsiest pretext to distort the meaning of 
  this great fight. The Communist Party associates itself without reservation 
  with the just struggle of the students...''</p>
<p class="subtitle">
  Wednesday 15 May </p>
<p>
  The enormous Monday demonstrations in Paris and other towns - which incidentally 
  prevented L'Humanit&eacute; as well as other papers from appearing on the Tuesday 
  - were a tremendous success. In a sense they triggered off the 'spontaneous' 
  wave of strikes which followed within a day or two. L'Humanit&eacute; publishes, 
  on its front pages a statement issued the day before by the Party's Political 
  Bureau, After taking all the credit for May 13, the statement continues: </p>
<p>
  The People of Paris marched for hours in the streets of the capital showing 
  a power which made any provocation impossible. The Party organizations worked 
  day and night to ensure that this great demonstration of workers, teachers and 
  students should take place in maximum unity, strength and discipline... It is 
  now clear that the Establishment confronted with the protests and collective 
  action of all the main sections of the population, will seek to divide us in 
  the hope of beating us. It will resort to all methods, including provocation. 
  The Political Bureau warns workers and students against any adventuress endeavors 
  which might, in the present circumstances, dislocate the broad front of the 
  struggle which is in the process of developing, and provide the Gaullist power 
  with an unexpected weapon with which to consolidate its shaky rule...''</p>
<p class="subtitle">
  Saturday 18 May</p>
<p>
  Over the past 48 hours, strikes with factory occupations have spread like a 
  trail of gunpowder, from one corner of the country to the other. The railways 
  are paralyzed, civil airports fly the red flag. ('provocateurs' have obviously 
  been at work!) L'Humanit&eacute; publishes on its front page a declaration from 
  the National Committee of the CGT: </p>
<p>
  From hour to hour strikes and factory occupations are spreading. This action, 
  started on the initiative of the CGT and of other trade union organizations 
  (sic), creates a new situation of exceptional importance... Long- accumulated 
  popular discontent is now finding expression. The questions being asked must 
  be answered seriously and full notice taken of their importance. The evolution 
  of the situation is giving a new dimension to the struggle... While multiplying 
  its efforts to raise the struggle to the needed level, the National Committee 
  warns all CGT militants and local groups against any attempts by outside groups 
  to meddle in the conduct of the struggle, and against all arts of provocation 
  which might assist the forces Of repression in their attempts to thwart the 
  development of the movement..''</p>
<p>
  The same issue of the paper devoted a whole page to warning students of the 
  fallacy of any notions of 'student power' - en passant - attributing to the 
  'Mouvement du 22 Mars' a whole series of political positions they had never 
  held. Monday 20 May The whole country is totally paralyzed. The Communist Party 
  is still warning about 'provocations'. The top right hand corner of L&#8217;Humanit&eacute; 
  contains a box labeled 'WARNING'': </p>
<p>
  Leaflets have been distributed in the Paris area calling for an insurrectionary 
  general strike, it goes without saying that such appeals have not been issued 
  by our democratic trade union organizations. They are the work of provocateurs 
  seeking to provide the government with a pretext for intervention... The workers 
  must be vigilant to defeat all such maneuvers...'''</p>
<p>
  In the same issue, Etienne Fajon of the Central Committee, continues the warnings'.. 
  </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> ''The Establishment's main preoccupation at the moment is to divide the 
    ranks of the working class and to divide it from other sections of the population... 
    Our Political Bureau has warned workers and students, from the very beginning, 
    against venturing slogans capable of dislocating the broad front of the struggle. 
    Several provocations have thus been prevented. Our political vigilance must 
    clearly be maintained...''.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  The same issue devoted its central pages to an interview of Mr Georges S&eacute;guy, 
  general secretary of, the CGT, conducted over the Europe No 1 radio network. 
  In these live interviews, various listeners phoned questions in directly. The 
  following exchanges are worth recording: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p> Question Mr S&eacute;guy, the workers on strike are everywhere saying that 
    they will go the whole hog. What do you mean by this? What are your objectives?''</p>
  <p> Answer, the strike is so powerful that the workers obviously mean to obtain 
    the maximum concessions at the end of such a movement. The whole hog for us 
    trade unionists, means winning the demands that we have always fought for, 
    but which the government and the employers have always refused to consider. 
    They have opposed an obtuse intransigence to the proposals for negotiations 
    which we have repeatedly made. ''The whole hog means a general rise in wages 
    (no wages less than 600 francs per month), guaranteed employment, an earlier 
    retirement age, reduction of working hours without loss of wages and the defense 
    and extension of trade union rights within the factory. I am not putting these 
    demands in any particular order because we attach the same importance to all 
    of them.''.</p>
  <p> Question If I am not mistaken the statutes of the CGT declare its aims to 
    be the overthrow of capitalism and its replacement by socialism. In the present 
    circumstances, that you have yourself referred to as 'exceptional' and 'important', 
    why doesn't the COT seize this unique chance of calling for its fundamental 
    objectives?''</p>
  <p> Answer ''This is a very interesting question. I like it very much, It is 
    true that the CGT offer: the workers a concept of trade unionism that we consider 
    the most revolutionary insofar as its final objective is the end of the employing 
    class and of wage labor. It is true that this is the first of our statutes, 
    It remains fundamentally the CGT'S objective. But can the present movement 
    reach this objective? lf it became obvious that it could, we would be ready 
    to assume our responsibilities. It remains to be seen whether all the social 
    strata involved in the present movement are ready to go that far'' </p>
  <p> Question Since fast week's events l have gone everywhere where people are 
    arguing. I went this afternoon to the Odeon Theatre. Masses of people were 
    discussing there, I can assure you that all the classes who suffer from the 
    present regime were represented there. When I asked whether people thought 
    that the movement should go further than the small demands put forward by 
    the trade unions for the last 10 or 20 years, I brought the house down. l 
    therefore think that it would be criminal to miss the present opportunity, 
    It would be criminal because sooner or later this will have to be done. The 
    conditions of today might aglow us to do it peacefully and calmly and will 
    perhaps never come back. I think this call must be made by you and the other 
    political organizations. These political organizations are not your business, 
    of course, but the CGT is a revolutionary organization. You must bring out 
    your revolutionary flag. The workers are astounded to see you so timid''</p>
  <p> Answer While you were bathing in the Odeon fever, I was in the factories. 
    Amongst workers. l assure you that the answer I am giving you is the answer 
    of a leader of a great trade union, which claims to have assumed all its responsibilities, 
    but which does not confuse its wishes with reality''</p>
  <p> Caller I would like to speak to Mr S&eacute;guy. My name is Duvauchel. l 
    am the director of the Sud Aviation factory at Nantes.''' S&eacute;guy ''Good 
    morning, sir.'''</p>
  <p> Duvauchel ''Good morning, Mr General Secretary. ! would like to know what 
    you think of the fact that for the last four days I have been sequestrated, 
    together with about 20 other managerial staff, inside the Sud Aviation factory 
    at Nantes'' S&eacute;guy ''Has anyone raised a hand against you'''</p>
  <p> Duvauchel ''No. But I am prevented from leaving, despite the fact that the 
    general manager of the firm has intimated that the firm was prepared to make 
    positive proposals as soon as free access to its factory could be resumed, 
    and first of all to its managerial staff'' S&eacute;guy Have you asked to 
    leave the factory?''</p>
  <p> Duvauchel ''Yes!''</p>
  <p> S&eacute;guy Was permission refused?''</p>
  <p> Duvauchel ''Yes!'' </p>
  <p> S&eacute;guy ''Then I must refer you to the declaration I made yesterday 
    at the CGT'S press conference. I stated that I disapproved of such activities. 
    We are taking the necessary steps to see they are not repeated''.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  But enough is enough. The Revolution itself will doubtless be denounced by the 
  Stalinists as a provocation! By way of an epilogue it is worth recording that 
  at a packed meeting of revolutionary students, held at the Mutuality on Thursday 
  9 May, a spokesman of theTrotskyist organization Communiste Internationalists 
  could think of nothing better to do than call on the meeting to pass a resolution 
  calling on S&eacute;guy to call a general strike!!!</p>
<p class="subtitle">
  France, 1968 </p>
<p>
  This has undoubtedly been the greatest revolutionary upheaval in Western Europe 
  since the days of the Paris Commune. Hundreds of thousands of students have 
  fought pitched battles with the police. Nine million workers have been on strike. 
  The red flag of revolt has flown over occupied factories, universities, building 
  sites, shipyards, primary and secondary schools, pit heads, railway stations, 
  department stores, docked transatlantic liners, theatres, hotels. The Paris 
  Opera, the Folies Berg&egrave;res and the building of the National Council for 
  Scientific Research were taken over, as were the headquarters of the French 
  Football Federation - whose aim was clearly perceived as being &quot;to prevent 
  ordinary footballers enjoying football'. </p>
<p>
  Virtually every layer of French society has been involved to some extent or 
  other. Hundreds of thousands of people of all ages have discussed every aspect 
  of life in packed-out, non-stop meetings in every available schoolroom and lecture 
  hall, Boys of 14 have invaded a primary school for girls shouting ''Libert&eacute; 
  pour les filles''. Even such traditionally reactionary enclaves as the Faculties 
  of Medicine and Law have been shaken from top to bottom, their hallowed procedures 
  and institutions challenged and found wanting. Millions have taken a hand in 
  making history. This is the stuff of revolution. </p>
<p>
  Under the influence of the revolutionary students, thousands began to query 
  the whole principle of hierarchy. The students had questioned it where it seemed 
  the most 'natural': in the realms of teaching and knowledge. They proclaimed 
  that democratic self-management was possible - and to prove it began to practice 
  it themselves. They denounced the monopoly of information and produced millions 
  of leaflets to break it. They attacked some of the main pillars of contemporary 
  'civilization': the barriers between manual workers and intellectuals; the consumer 
  society, the 'sanctity' of the university and of other founts of capitalist 
  culture and wisdom. Within a matter of days the tremendous creative potentialities 
  of the people suddenly erupted. The boldest and most realistic ideas - and they 
  are usually the same - were advocated, argued, applied. Language, rendered stale 
  by decades of bureaucratic mumbo- jumbo, eviscerated by those who manipulate 
  it for advertising purposes, suddenly reappeared as something new and fresh. 
  People re-appropriated it in all its fullness. Magnificently apposite and poetic 
  slogans emerged from the anonymous crowd, Children explained to their elders 
  what the function of education should be. The educators were educated, Within 
  a few days, young people of 20 attained a level of understanding and a political 
  and tactical sense which many who had been in the revolutionary movement for 
  30 years or more were still sadly lacking. </p>
<p>
  The tumultuous development of the students struggle triggered off the first 
  factory occupations. It transformed both the relation of forces in society and 
  the image, in people's minds of established leaders. It compelled the State 
  to institutions and of established reveal both its oppressive nature and its 
  fundamental incoherence. It exposed the utter emptiness of Government, Parliament, 
  Administration - and of ALL the political parties. Unarmed students had forced 
  the Establishment to drop its mask, to sweat with fear, to resort to the police 
  club and to the gas grenade. Students finally compelled the bureaucratic leaderships 
  of the 'working class organizations to reveal themselves as the ultimate custodians 
  of the established order. </p>
<p>
  But the revolutionary movement did still more. It fought its battles in Paris, 
  not in some under-developed country, exploited by imperialism. In a glorious 
  few weeks the actions of students and young workers dispelled the myth of the 
  well-organized, well-oiled modern capitalist society, from which radical conflict 
  had been eliminated and in which only marginal problems remained to be solved. 
  Administrators who had been administering everything were suddenly shown to 
  have had a grasp of nothing. Planners who had planned everything showed themselves 
  incapable of ensuring the endorsement of their plans by those to whom they applied. 
  This most modern movement should allow real revolutionaries to shed a number 
  of the ideological encumbrances which in the past had hampered revolutionary 
  activity. It wasn't hunger which drove the students to revolt. There wasn't 
  an 'economic crisis' even in the loosest sense of the term. The revolt had nothing 
  to do with 'under-consumption' or with 'over-production', The 'falling rate 
  of profit' just didn't come into the picture. Moreover, the student movement 
  wasn't based on economic demands. On the contrary, the movement only found its 
  real stature, and only evoked its tremendous response, when it went beyond the 
  economic demands within which official student unionism had for so long sought 
  to contain it (incidentally with the blessing of all the political parties and 
  'revolutionary' groups of the 'Left'). And conversely it was by confining the 
  workers' struggle to purely economic objectives that the trade union bureaucrats 
  have so far succeeded in coming to the assistance of the regime. </p>
<p>
  The present movement has shown that the fundamental contradiction of modern 
  bureaucratic capitalism isn't the 'anarchy of the market'. It isn't the 'contradiction 
  between the forces of production and the property relations'. The central conflict 
  to which all others are related is the conflict between order-givers (dirigeants) 
  and order-takers (&eacute;x&eacute;cutants). The insoluble contradiction which 
  tears the guts out of modern capitalist society is the one which compels it 
  to exclude people from the management of their own activities and Which at the 
  same time compels it to solicit their participation, without which it would 
  collapse. These tendencies find expression on the one hand in the attempt of 
  the bureaucrats to convert men into objects (by violence, mystification, new 
  manipulation techniques -- or 'economic' carrots' and, on the other hand, in 
  mankind's refusal to allow itself to be treated in this way. </p>
<p>
  The French events show clearly something that all revolutions have shown, but 
  which apparently has again and again to be learned anew. There is no 'inbuilt 
  revolutionary perspective', no 'gradual increase of contradictions', no 'progressive 
  development of a revolutionary mass consciousness'. What are given are the contradictions 
  and the conflicts we have described and the fact that modern bureaucratic society 
  more of less inevitably produces periodic 'accidents' which disrupt its functioning 
  These both provoke popular intervention and provide the people with opportunities 
  for asserting themselves and for changing the social order. The functioning 
  of bureaucratic capitalism creates the conditions within which revolutionary 
  consciousness may appear. These conditions are an integral part of the whole 
  alienating hierarchical and oppressive social structure. Whenever people struggle, 
  sooner or later they are compelled to question the whole of that social structure. 
  These are ideas which many of us in Solidarity have long subscribed to. They 
  were developed at length in some of Paul Cardan's pamphlets. Writing in Le Monde 
  (20 May 1968) E Morin admits that what is happening today in France is ''a blinding 
  resurrection: the resurrection of that libertarian strand which seeks conciliation 
  with Marxism, in a formula of which Socialisme ou Barbarie had provided a first 
  synthesis a few years ago...''. As after every verification of basic concepts 
  in the crucible of real events, many will proclaim that these had always been 
  their views. This, of course isn't true.' The point however isn't to lay claims 
  to a kind of copyright in the realm of correct revolutionary ideas. We welcome 
  converts, from whatever sources and however belated. We can't deal here at length 
  with what is now an important problem in France, namely the creation of a new 
  kind of revolutionary movement, Things would indeed have been different if such 
  a movement had existed, strong enough to outwit the bureaucratic maneuvered, 
  alert enough day by day to expose the duplicity of the 'left' leaderships, deeply 
  enough implanted to explain to the workers the real meaning of the students' 
  struggle, to propagate the idea of autonomous strike committees (linking up 
  union and non-union members); of workers' management of production and of workers' 
  councils. Many things which could have been done weren't done because there 
  wasn't such a movement. The way the students' own struggle was unleashed shows 
  that such an organization could have played a most impotent catalytic role without 
  automatically becoming a bureaucratic 'leadership'. But such regrets are futile. 
  The non-existence of such a movement is no accident, If it had been formed during 
  the previous period it certainly wouldn't have been the kind of movement of 
  which we are speaking, Even taking the 'best' of the small organizations -- 
  and multiplying its numbers a hundredfold - wouldn't have met the requirements 
  of the current situation. When confronted with the test of events all the 'left' 
  groups just continued playing their old gramophone records, Whatever their merits 
  as depositories of the cold ashes of the revolution - a task they have now carried 
  out for several decades - they proved incapable of snapping out of their old 
  ideas and routines, incapable of learning or of forgetting anything. </p>
<p>
  The new revolutionary movement will have to be built from the new elements (students 
  and workers) who have understood the real significance of current events. The 
  revolution must step into the great political void revealed by the crisis of 
  the old society. It must develop a voice, a face, a paper - and it must do it 
  soon. We can understand the reluctance of some students to form such an organization. 
  They feel there is a contradiction between action and thought, between spontaneity 
  and organization. Their hesitation is fed by the whole of their previous experience, 
  They have seen how thought could become sterilizing dogma, organization become 
  bureaucracy or lifeless ritual, speech become a means of mystification, a revolutionary 
  idea become a rigid and stereotyped program. Through their actions, their boldness, 
  their reluctance to consider long-term aims, they had broken out of this straight-jacket. 
  But this isn't enough. </p>
<p>
  Moreover many of them had sampled the traditional 'left' groups. In all their 
  fundamental aspects these groups remain trapped within the ideological and organizational 
  frameworks of bureaucratic capitalism. They have programs fixed once and for 
  all, leaders who utter fixed speeches, whatever the changing reality around 
  them, organizational forms which mirror those of existing society. Such groups 
  reproduce within their own ranks the division between order-takers and order-givers, 
  between those who 'know' and those who don't, the separation between scholastic 
  pseudo-theory and real life. They would even like to impose this division into 
  the working class, whom they all aspire to lead, because (and I was told this 
  again and again) &quot;the workers are only capable of developing a trade union 
  consciousness''. </p>
<p>
  But these students are wrong. One doesn't get beyond bureaucratic organization 
  by denying all organization. One doesn't challenge the sterile rigidity of finished 
  programs by refusing to define oneself in terms of aims and methods. One doesn't 
  refute dead dogma by the condemnation of all theoretical reflection. The students 
  and young workers can't just stay where they are. To accept these 'contradictions' 
  as valid and as something which cannot be transcended is to accept the essence 
  of bureaucratic capitalist ideology. It is to accept the prevailing philosophy 
  and the prevailing reality. It is to integrate the revolution into an established 
  historical order. if the revolution is only an explosion lasting a few days 
  (or weeks), the established order - whether it knows it or not - will be able 
  to cope. What is more - at a deep level class society even needs such jolts. 
  This kind of 'revolution' permits class society to survive by compelling it 
  to transform and adapt itself. This is the real danger today. Explosions which 
  disrupt the imaginary world in which alienated societies tend to live -- and 
  bring them momentarily down to earth help them eliminate outmoded methods of 
  domination and evolve new and more flexible ones. Action or thought? For revolutionary 
  socialists the problem is not to make a synthesis of these two preoccupations 
  of the revolutionary students. It is to destroy the social context in which 
  such false alternatives find root. </p>
