<p class="title">OUTSIDE AND AGAINST THE UNIONS</p>
<p class="subtitle">A communist response to Dave Douglass' text &quot;Refracted 
  Perspective&quot;</p>
<p class="author">by Wildcat (UK)</p>
<p class="subtitle">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>This pamphlet is written in response to the pamphlet &quot;Refracted 
  Perspective&quot; (available from: 121 Bookshop, 121 Railton Road, Brixton, 
  London SE24). As you may have guessed, this is mostly a flimsy excuse to make 
  a general critique of the trade unions -- something we in Wildcat haven't done 
  for quite a while. It focuses on the situation in Britain in recent years, particularly 
  the 1984-85 miners' strike. This is not because of some nationalistic obsession 
  with what goes on in these islands but because we want to make our analysis 
  as concrete as possible - this means writing about things we know from reliable 
  sources or were actually involved in. We also want to refute Mr. Douglass' arguments 
  as thoroughly as possible so we can't avoid talking about particular things 
  done by the NUM. </p>
<p align="left">A detailed article on the origins of modern trade unionism in 
  Britain, focusing on the crucial year of 1842 when the Miners' Federation was 
  founded, can be found in Wildcat No. 16. </font></p>
<p align="left">In the British Isles and North America at the present time (late 
  1992) the trade union question may seem a bit irrelevant given the low level 
  of workplace class struggle. Since 1979 membership of TUC-affiliated unions 
  in Britain has declined from 12 million to 8 million. We can be sure, though, 
  that once workplace struggle starts to pick up again trade unionism will once 
  again rear its ugly head and wherever workers are struggling as workers , be 
  it Germany, South Africa or South Korea, the issue is as important as ever.</p>
<p class="subtitle">THAT SPEECH</p>
<p align="left">The purpose of Douglass' speech at the Class War international 
  conference (the text of which was published as &quot;Refracted Perspective&quot;) 
  was quite clear. It was to stifle criticism of trade unionism in and around 
  the anarchist movement. Before getting stuck into some serious criticism of 
  what he said we should point out that he was not just expressing his opinion 
  but defending his role in society. He is not, as he likes to describe himself, 
  a &quot;Yorkshire miner&quot; but a full-time NUM delegate.</p>
<p>The main way he attacks criticism is by means of the classic Stalinist &quot;amalgam 
  technique&quot;. This means deliberately mixing up two or more very different 
  political positions which you don't like in order to create confusion and uncritical 
  support for your point of view. For example during the Second World War the 
  Communist Parties referred to &quot;Trotsky-Fascism&quot;. </font></p>
<p >Similarly, Mr Douglass tries to amalgamate idiotic lefties like the Workers' 
  Revolutionary Party with people he calls &quot;Situationists&quot; - this is 
  obviously a code word for class struggle militants who are against the unions 
  from a communist point of view. I assume he calls us Situationists because he 
  wants to give the impression we're a bunch of misfit art students. This is not 
  what the Situationists were but its a popular stereotype of their followers, 
  which has some truth in it. </font></p>
<p>The amalgam technique at its crudest is shown when he claims that the Socialist 
  Workers' Party are &quot;venomously anti-union&quot;. Since when? The SWP don't 
  just support unions, often it's SWupPies who keep union branches going. The 
  same goes for his &quot;The Leninist with his [sic] vision of the trade union 
  as an obstacle to the struggle...&quot; comment. Most Leninists stare at you 
  in amazement if you suggest that the unions are anti-working class. Try it sometime. 
  You might even say that &quot;The Leninist intellectuals of and by themselves 
  can only achieve a trade union consciousness&quot;. </font></p>
<p>To be fair though, a lot of what he says about lefties and the 1984-85 miners' 
  strike is true. For example, the SWP believes that the only thing wrong with 
  the mass picket at the Orgreave depot in S. Yorkshire was that it wasn't big 
  enough. This view is still supported by SWupPies to this very day. His description 
  of some icepick head selling &quot;Workers' Power&quot; in the middle of a riot 
  is both amusing and familiar. </font></p>
<p  class="subtitle">ANARCHO-LENINISM</p>
<p >Dave Douglass attacks the lefties for arrogantly telling the workers what 
  to do and for seeing workers' struggles as just a means of spreading their politics. 
  But what he's really slagging them off for is for being too honest - they openly 
  try to push their ideology and present themselves as leaders. Dave Douglass 
  would like to see Class War do it more subtly. That his perspective is not much 
  different from the Leninists is shown by his attitude toward Orgreave. He gives 
  a really good account of what's wrong with trench warfare against pigs on a 
  terrain they have chosen. BUT he publicly supported it (and therefore encouraged 
  participation in this defeat at the hands of the pigs). This is not much different 
  from those lefties who encourage workers to do things that they know are a load 
  of crap - like voting Labour and calling on the TUC to call a general strike. 
</p>
<p>No doubt those of us who said at the time that Orgreave was a waste of time 
  were just &quot;vanguards&quot; who were &quot;telling ordinary workers what 
  to do&quot;. </font></p>
<p>His attitude is further revealed in the last paragraph of his Really Fucked 
  Perspective when he defends the classic Leninist separation between the masses 
  and the Party - &quot;THEY ARE NOT WAITING FOR US&quot;. Who are &quot;THEY&quot;? 
  Who are &quot;US&quot;? &quot;We should assist them in the way THEY wish to 
  be assisted&quot; - This is patronising drivel. What if &quot;THEY&quot; want 
  us to help &quot;them&quot; lobby the Labour Party conference? We would tell 
  them this was a stupid thing to do. If this makes us &quot;vanguardists&quot; 
  then, Yes, it's a fair cop, guv. </font></p>
<p>Why should one section of the working class put itself &quot;at the disposal&quot; 
  of another? If our comrades in struggle makes mistakes we have to criticise 
  them and sometimes even physically stop them from doing what they want to do. 
  The reason for this is simple: if they fuck up it fucks up things for all of 
  us. There can be no question of &quot;self-determination&quot; for any section 
  of the class: we're all in this together. If this approach means we don't sell 
  as many papers as we'd like, that's too bad. </font></p>
<p class="subtitle">THE UNIONS</font></p>
<p>What Douglass doesn't talk about at all in his reminiscences of the 1984-85 
  Great Strike is the antagonism that existed between the union apparatus and 
  the unofficial actions of the miners and others in the mining communities which 
  he thinks were just extensions of the unions. <br>
  Let's start with an example from before the strike. In mid-1983 Arthur Scargill, 
  NUM President, was about to meet then Coal Board Chairman Derek Ezra in Pontypridd. 
  Some Welsh miners on wildcat strike against pit closures occupied the regional 
  NCB office. Scargill came along in person to order an end to the occupation. 
  Later in the day, though, he did maintain his reputation as a militant by &quot;storming 
  out&quot; of the meeting with Ezra, revealing the Board's hit-list of threatened 
  pits. </font></p>
<p>Obvious examples from the strike were: </font></p>
<p>1) Anyone seriously involved in the miners' strike who didn't live in a mining 
  area very quickly worked out (sometimes from bitter experience) that the only 
  way to get money to where it was needed was to give it directly to the strikers 
  and their families. Money given to the union bureaucrats generally never reached 
  strikers at all and certainly didn't reach those known to be trouble makers. </font> 
</p>
<p align="left">2) The union threatened to discipline and fire miners who threw 
  bricks at the police at Gascoigne Wood. </p>
<p align="left">3) Throughout the strike McGahey and his cronies issued orders 
  forbidding mass pickets in Scotland. </p>
<p align="left">4) At the beginning of 1985 the Yorkshire Area NUM took its minibuses 
  away from the Fitzwilliam miners to stop them indulging in aggressive flying 
  picketing.</p>
<p align="left"> 5) In March 1984 in Ollerton, Notts. a picket was killed by a 
  scab lorry. Scargill stood on top of a car and called for two minutes silence 
  in order to stop the strikers from taking revenge against the cops and scabs. 
</p>
<p align="left">I could go on... </p>
<p align="left">It should be obvious from these examples that his metaphor about 
  the workers driving the union bus as far as it will go is rather misleading. 
  It's not just a case of the bureaucrats applying the breaks - more a case of 
  them turning the bus around and using it to run over the workers! <br>
  &nbsp; <br>
  In fact when he's writing about &quot;the union&quot; he conveniently forgets 
  (most of the time) that there is a union apparatus at all. He talks as if the 
  union was just a collection of autonomous union branches. This makes it much 
  easier for him to repeat the classic lie of every left-wing union hack - &quot;It's 
  your union, you can do what you like with it. It's a democratic organisation 
  and if you've got enough support from the membership you can give it any policies 
  you want&quot;. </p>
<p align="left">The lie that the union is its members is continually exposed in 
  practice. The NUM is no exception. The 1977 productivity deal initiated by Tony 
  Benn, which did so much to divide miners between regions, was forced through 
  by the NUM executive despite a National Ballot rejecting it. In 1983 NUM leaders 
  ignored an 80% strike vote in South Wales. In April 1984 the leaders of Lancashire 
  NUM held an area delegate meeting to try to find a way to send the Lancs. miners 
  back to work. Thirty of the miners who had been lobbying the meeting organised 
  an occupation of the NUM headquarters in Bolton. They wanted to prevent further 
  meetings, saying &quot;you don't need a meeting to run the strike -only to call 
  it off&quot;. </p>
<p class="subtitle">WHAT ARE UNIONS?</p>
<p align="left">Dave Douglass would have us believe that unions are workers' self 
  defence organisations. This is the traditional lefty view which you can read 
  in every Trot paper ever written. It's also believed by millions of workers 
  but not by us. </p>
<p align="left">If unions don't defend workers' interests (even badly), what do 
  they do? The answer is that they negotiate with the bosses. They negotiate the 
  rate of exploitation. </p>
<p align="left">We're not taking a moralistic &quot;Death before negotiation&quot; 
  stance here. As long as wage labour exists workers will be forced to negotiate 
  with employees from time to time, particularly when struggles are defeated. 
  Most workers negotiate with their bosses individually in one way or another 
  (&quot;I'll let you go home early if you get this finished&quot;). </p>
<p align="left">Negotiations, though, always involve an agreement to play by the 
  rules of the game, for example by agreeing to honour productivity deals. It 
  is a form of class collaboration. As the institutionalisation of the negotiating 
  process unions must inevitably hold back workers' struggles. It is no surprise 
  that unions have almost always condemned forms of struggle which are difficult 
  to negotiate, such as theft and sabotage. This is not a recent phenomenon. In 
  1889 Tom Mann, the famous leader of the London based Dockers' Union, signed 
  several appeals for the men to work more enthusiastically. They were trying 
  to force the bosses to increase manning levels and were making wide-spread use 
  of &quot;ca'canny&quot; (going slow). In 1892 Tom Mann even suggested to the 
  Royal Commission on Labour (of which he was a member) that piece rates be brought 
  in! </p>
<p align="left">Negotiation is not just an economic activity, it is a political 
  one as well. Negotiating with the bosses on behalf of workers is a form of political 
  representation. Representing people is not about fighting for their interests. 
  It is about maintaining the loyalty of a passive &quot;constituency&quot;. This 
  can clearly be seen from union recruitment policy which is to try to sell membership 
  to anyone who will pay the membership dues, no matter how reactionary they may 
  be, as long as they work in the right trade/industry. It should be obvious that 
  no working class organisation could ever operate this way. </p>
<p align="left">It is no coincidence that the democratic ideology is promoted 
  more vigorously in the unions than anywhere else in society. Workers' own struggles, 
  though, almost always begin with militant action by a minority. They make nonsense 
  in practice of &quot;majoritarianism&quot; (the idea that nothing should take 
  place unless a majority agrees) and the separation between decision-making and 
  action that is enshrined in democracy. Democracy, with its fetish for the airing 
  of opinions, and the moment of decision as a preliminary to acting, offers nothing 
  to workers. It offers everything to those who would divert, institutionalise 
  or block their struggles, whether it's the Right with their secret ballots or 
  the Left with their delegate conferences and mass participatory democracy. </p>
<p class="subtitle">CORPORATISM</p>
<p align="left">Corporatism is the identification of workers with their workplace 
  or industry. It is not just an idea. It is a material force resulting from the 
  absence of solidarity between workers in different sectors and between workplaces 
  and other areas of society (particularly where proletarians live). Unions are 
  the corporatist organisation par excellence. The attachment of the NUM to the 
  &quot;Plan for Coal&quot; was just one expression of this. </p>
<p align="left">Admittedly corporatism can't simply be blamed on the unions. When 
  workers on a picket line express suspicion toward &quot;outsiders&quot; who 
  come to show support it's not just because they believe in &quot;the union&quot; 
  (although it's usually the shop steward who's the first to ask &quot;What union 
  are you in, then?&quot;) Nor, unfortunately, is it just because &quot;they don't 
  want to be told what to do by middle-class students&quot; as many apologists 
  for working class conservatism would have us believe. </p>
<p align="left">Any workplace struggle can fall into the trap of corporatism as 
  long as it remains just a workplace struggle. Against the workerist lefties 
  who claim that workers only have power at the point of production we would say 
  that it is territorially based struggles which have the greatest subversive 
  potential. This was undoubtedly one of the strengths of the anti-poll tax movement 
  (despite the obvious problem of &quot;localism&quot; - usually involving sentimental 
  notions about &quot;our local community&quot;). In the miners' strike too the 
  high points were when the whole of the working class in a particular area became 
  involved - e.g. defence of pit villages against the police. &quot;Territory&quot; 
  includes workplaces and it is often strategically very important to disrupt, 
  seize and/or destroy them. Workplace occupations, for example, are an important 
  opportunity for undermining the role of the workplace as an &quot;enterprise&quot; 
  separate from the rest of society - by inviting other proletarians into the 
  site besides those who normally work there, by reappropriating resources such 
  as printing and communications, by giving away useful products stored at the 
  site... Then there's straightforward destruction - denying it to the enemy! 
  The miners who responded to coal-faces collapsing during the Great Strike by 
  saying &quot;to hell with the pits!&quot; were expressing a real break with 
  NUM corporatism. </p>
<p  class="subtitle">DEGENERATES</p>
<p align="left">An organisation can start off defending workers' interests and 
  degenerate into a trade union. That is, it can start off organising and extending 
  the struggle and end up negotiating it away. This has often been the fate of 
  independent strike committees in France, Italy and Spain (in Britain they usually 
  just end up integrated into the official unions). </p>
<p align="left">The question of when to stop participating in such a committee 
  and start denouncing it is always a tricky one but with officially recognised 
  trade unions there is _no_ such ambiguity. </p>
<p align="left">Certainly unions have to be flexible to stay in business. Under 
  rank and file pressure they will often adopt a militant stance and to some extent 
  will even allow workers to use the local union apparatus to conduct struggles 
  - e.g. branch meetings, strike funds, picket caravans. Trying to &quot;take 
  over&quot; the apparatus, though, is a dead end. Even on an organisational level 
  a union is simply not designed for advancing workers' struggles. The most basic 
  rules of branch procedure are designed to hinder them. In mid 1984 some striking 
  miners from South Kirkby tried to organise a team of miners who could not easily 
  go out picketing due to stringent bail conditions. They were to go out knocking 
  on doors trying to convince passive strikers to become active pickets. They 
  started doing it anyway but tried putting a resolution to the NUM branch. It 
  was rejected by the branch committee. It could still go through as correspondence 
  so they tried packing the meeting with their supporters. The branch committee 
  ruled it out of order. One of the strikers concluded &quot;I think that shows 
  you we've got to know the rule book...&quot;. This is rubbish. What it shows 
  is the need to throw the rule book out the window and the authority of the branch 
  committee with it. <br>
  Unions are certainly not designed for spreading strikes outside the industry 
  or sector where they start. Quite the opposite. On many miners' picket lines 
  non-NUM members were regularly allowed to cross and in Lancashire there was 
  no attempt to close down opencast pits in the area - these were not owned by 
  the NCB and their workers were in the T&amp;G not the NUM. </p>
<p align="left">During the Great Strike NUM leaders (particularly Scargill) certainly 
  made appeals to support from other groups of workers but this never went beyond 
  meetings with other union leaders and televised public speeches. To have appealed 
  directly to other workers would have breached the democratic etiquette between 
  unions - one set of &quot;laws&quot; that the oh-so-radical Mr. Scargill has 
  no intention of flouting. </p>
<p  class="subtitle">BUREAUCRACY</p>
<p align="left">Many people say that the trouble with the unions is that they 
  are too hierarchical and bureaucratic. This misses the point. Unions don't serve 
  the interests of capital because they are bureaucratic. They are bureaucratic 
  because they serve the interests of capital. The very process of negotiation 
  fosters specialists in the sale of labour power. It inevitably involves a small 
  team of active negotiators and a lot of workers hanging around waiting for the 
  result. The negotiators and bosses need to develop personal understandings, 
  to trust each other. Usually this is all done by union bureaucrats but even 
  where strikers elect their own representatives, these almost immediately start 
  to fight the control and revocability exercised over them. They will want to 
  assume the role of leaders on a basis of equality with their opposite numbers 
  in negotiation, and will be supported by strikers themselves who will want to 
  be led by people who reassure them that everything is going well. When a deal 
  in finally done there will no doubt be those who cry &quot;sell out!&quot;, 
  but it is the workers who have sold themselves out by accepting the logic of 
  negotiations. </p>
<p align="left">Some people say that unions are infected with reactionary ideas, 
  such as parliamentarism and statism (affiliation to the Labour Party in Britain 
  for example). This also misses the point. It should come as no surprise that 
  those who run capitalist institutions usually have shamelessly pro-capitalist 
  ideas. But even where they don't the fact of running a union imposes its own 
  logic. In the years before the First World War the syndicalist Confederation 
  Generale du Travail (CGT) in France had passed numerous motions at its congresses 
  calling for a general strike in the event of war. It had even distributed handbooks 
  informing its members of detailed practical steps to be taken to sabotage the 
  war effort. But when war came the CGT rushed to join Poincare's union sacree. 
  This was a popular front in support of the war. </p>
<p align="left">Closely related to these ideas is the commonly held view that 
  there are &quot;real unions&quot; (such as UCATT and NUPE) and &quot;scab unions&quot; 
  (such as EEPTU and RCN) and that it's better to be in a real union than a scab 
  union. This hardly stands up to the most superficial historical investigation. 
  Every union has blatantly encouraged scabbing at some stage in its history. 
  In the construction industry in Britain, for example, its certainly true that 
  EETPU members have crossed UCATT picket lines but it's also true that UCATT 
  members have crossed EETPU picket lines - sometimes justified on the grounds 
  that EETPU is a scab union so its OK to scab on them! </p>
<p class="subtitle">BASE UNIONISM</p>
<p align="left">The particular brand of rank and file unionism put forward by 
  DD isn't the usual Trot variety. He doesn't call on workers to lobby the union 
  leaders. He even criticises Arthur Scargill at one point (a serious offence 
  in the eyes of most lefties and militant miners!). </p>
<p align="left">His view is that workers involved in subversive actions (hit squads, 
  surprise pickets, organisation involving the whole of the working class not 
  just miners ...) should still be encouraged to see themselves as part of the 
  union and still try to act within the framework of the union. They should still 
  be loyal to it even if they have their disagreements. So when Heathfield, the 
  leader of the Yorkshire NUM, condemns them for defending themselves against 
  the police, or the area NUM takes away the branch minibus, they should still 
  respect the authority of these people. </p>
<p align="left">Like many anarchists, DD has a lot of respect for &quot;ordinary 
  people&quot;. He wants them to stay ordinary, that is: submissive to capital. 
  At one stage he asks &quot;which has more loyalty FROM the class&quot;? Unions 
  or obscure lefty groups? The Royal Family have more loyalty than either. </p>
<p  class="subtitle">THE NUM</p>
<p align="left">It's true that during the 1984-85 strike the behaviour of the 
  NUM posed real problems for revolutionaries. It didn't seem to fit pre-conceived 
  notions of how unions are supposed to behave. Outside one or two traditional 
  industries (what's left of mining, what's left of craft unionism in the print 
  industry ...) the working class experience of unions in Britain is pretty straightforward. 
  They almost always oppose any strike until they realise they can stop it or 
  it's been balloted to death. The anti-strike (so-called &quot;anti-union&quot;) 
  legislation passed under the Thatcher governments has made them sabotage workers' 
  struggles even more blatantly than they used to. In short, The NUM is not the 
  T&amp;G. It is a radical, left wing union. The main reason for this is simple 
  - the existence of a militant rank and file. An area official in the NUM who 
  tried to behave like his counterpart in NUPE or NALGO would simply lose control. 
  This doesn't in any way alter the fundamental nature of the NUM.</p>
<p align="left">The militancy of the miners has been a real obstruction to capital 
  accumulation - a blockage which could only be removed by closing the pits. Miners' 
  militancy goes back a long way. In the 1930's the number of days &quot;lost&quot; 
  (to the bosses) in strikes by miners equalled the number lost in the whole of 
  the rest of British industry. After nationalisation in 1947 they were still 
  accounting for a third of the days lost. It has not been an unbroken tradition 
  though. Throughout the sixties hundreds of pits were closed and many miners 
  left the industry. In other words, full employment&nbsp; at first&nbsp; enabled 
  the economy to be peacefully restructured; mining was no exception, by 1970 
  the workforce was 47% of what it was in 1960. But full employment and the central 
  importance of coal mining in providing energy for a still-expanding economy 
  created the conditions for a massive upswing in militancy in the '60's and early 
  '70's. The example of the miners undoubtedly inspired many millions of workers 
  to confront the bosses. </p>
<p align="left">Since its formation on January 1 1945 the NUM (just like its predecessor 
  the Miners' Federation) has always played an indispensable role in managing 
  capitalist exploitation. After nationalisation in 1947 the National Executive 
  of the NUM pledged itself to &quot;do everything possible to promote and maintain 
  a spirit of self-discipline ... and a readiness to carry out all reasonable 
  orders given by management&quot;. In this period there were numerous wildcat 
  strikes opposed by the NUM. When, seven months after nationalisation, a strike 
  which began at Grimethorpe spread to 38 pits the Yorkshire Area General Secretary 
  said that the men must choose &quot;between industrial democracy and anarchy&quot;. 
  Another union bureaucrat, Will Lawther, said that the NCB should prosecute the 
  strikers &quot;even if there are 50,000 or 100,000 of them&quot;. </p>
<p align="left">A major factor in miners' militancy is that mining is about the 
  only industry left (just about) where workers still live in a community which 
  exists almost entirely to serve that industry. This means that links of solidarity 
  are forged not just at work but in the street and the Miners' Welfare Club as 
  well. The involvement of the union in the community&nbsp; means that it is much 
  more a part of daily life than elsewhere. This makes it much harder for miners 
  to even think about acting independently of the union. Contrast this with the 
  situation for most workers, where &quot;the union&quot; consists of a membership 
  card, cheap insurance deals and a group of hacks who attend an inquorate branch 
  meeting every month.</p>
<p align="left">This makes it easier for the NUM leaders to put across the classic 
  lie that &quot;we can't fight without our union&quot;. That this is a lie is 
  shown by the history of workers' struggles. As we've seen, many of the important 
  strikes in the coal industry have been unofficial, or at least started off that 
  way. An even better example is the dockers in Britain before &quot;decasualisation&quot; 
  (casual labourers being given permanent jobs) in 1967 who were a notoriously 
  stroppy group of workers. After World War II the T&amp;G (the main union on 
  the docks) didn't make any strike official until 1961 despite over a dozen major 
  stoppages. In the mid-60's a third of Liverpool dockers weren't even in unions 
  despite the high level of union control over hiring. From around the world we 
  can think of far more dramatic examples: of mass strikes which have had nothing 
  to do with union organisation at all - from the 10 million workers who went 
  on strike in May '68 in France completely against the wishes of the 'Communist' 
  Party controlled unions (to which most of them belonged) to the Iranian oil 
  workers on strike in 1979 who stayed out despite being offered pay rises of 
  hundreds of percent (they wanted to bring down the Shah's regime not just win 
  a pay rise!). </p>
<p  class="subtitle">BUT WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE ...?</p>
<p align="left">This is the question lefties and trade unionist always ask of 
  us weirdoes who are for workers' struggles but against the unions. The short 
  answer is: we're not proposing an &quot;alternative to the unions&quot;. If 
  you want to negotiate the rate of exploitation and reinforce working class corporatism 
  the unions are an excellent way of doing it. Just like the cops, union hacks 
  are doing a difficult job and doing it very well under the circumstances. That's 
  why we hate them. </p>
<p align="left">A more relevant question is: &quot;How should we organise in work-places 
  to fight for our immediate needs and undermine capitalism?&quot;. The short 
  answer to this is: the same way we organise anywhere else. We are not interested 
  in representing anybody but in building up groups and networks of activists 
  who want to escalate the class war by whatever means are necessary. The links 
  we develop between class struggle militants now will be useful when mass struggles 
  do break out, in terms of spreading and coordinating struggles, circulating 
  information, seizing resources and so on. It should be clear from what we've 
  said so far that this process can only take place outside and&nbsp; against 
  the unions. How many more times do union officials have to promise to grass 
  up workers involved in sabotage to the police before this becomes obvious to 
  every class struggle militant? </p>
