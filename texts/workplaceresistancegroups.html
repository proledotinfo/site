<p align="center" class="title">WORKPLACE RESISTANCE GROUPS</p>
<p align="center" class="author"> by the Anarchist Federation (UK)</p>
<p align="justify"> Whether unionized or non-unionized, the idea of resistance 
  groups in your workplace may seem a long way from reality (especially in the 
  current social climate), but this is a goal we need to be moving towards. Obviously, 
  if such a thing is unrealistic where you work and would only quickly get you 
  sacked then it would be silly to advocate it (unless you don&#8217;t mind getting 
  sacked). For others though, it might seem a plausible possibility, especially 
  if you have been involved in some ongoing dispute or there is a degree of anger 
  and discontent.</p>
<p align="justify">Such groups must not seek to be alternative unions; they must 
  be anti-capitalist, anti-company and act outside of the union&#8217;s structures 
  and all political parties. They should advocate class war and practice direct 
  action to achieve their objectives and have no respect for legality. Such groups 
  have a propaganda function (pushing resistance and rebellion, slagging management, 
  attacking union bureaucrats, advocating go-slows, non-cooperation, sabotage, 
  unofficial action, mass sick days, etc.) and an active function (i.e. actually 
  doing or trying to organize for what they advocate). They would have to be semi-secret 
  (for obvious reasons).</p>
<p align="justify">Obviously, they shouldn&#8217;t be limited to revolutionaries 
  or anarchists only; they are intended for angry people who basically want to 
  fight management and the bosses by the most effective means. People don&#8217;t 
  have to call themselves revolutionaries to be good class fighters and potential 
  revolutionaries. The important thing is that such groups have no official dealings 
  with the union (even though members might be in the union) and have no pretensions 
  of becoming an alternative union. Their aims should be to hammer the company 
  as effectively as possible (a bit like a &#8220;hit squad&#8221;) and link up 
  with other similar groups (if or where they exist).</p>
<p align="justify">Such resistance groups may operate in a particular workplace 
  or may be a national grouping of revolutionaries and rebels based around a particular 
  industry or line of work.</p>
