<p class="title">Take Over the City</p>
<p class="author">from Lotta Continua<br>
  Translated and edited by Ernest Dowson. Taken From Radical America, vol. 7,

<p class="subtitle">Translator&#8217;s Preface</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Community struggle in Italy has gone beyond the trade- union tradition which 
    limits the class struggle to the fight for higher wages. The Italian working 
    class has recognized that their needs for a freer and happier life cannot 
    be realized by increasing the spending power of individual groups of workers. 
    Any gains made inside the factories have been countered by the bosses&#8217; 
    use of inflation and property speculation. Social services (housing, hospitals, 
    schools, and so on) are determined solely by the needs of the large firms. 
    In this situation the struggle in the community becomes crucial and working&#8212;class 
    people are forced to discover new forms of self-organization, tactics, and 
    demands.</p>
  <p>The rent strikes have developed not as symbolic acts of protest against government 
    policies, but as a direct response to the tyranny of rent. Thousands of families, 
    finding that they can&#8217;t afford the rent or not being able to see why 
    they should pay it when they are living in run-down tenements or in projects 
    where there are no amenities, fall into arrears and are threatened with eviction. 
    The rent strike binds them together and makes an active weapon out of a series 
    of isolated protests.</p>
  <p>The strikes are organized block by block, staircase by staircase, with regular 
    meetings, newsletters, wall newspapers, leaflets, and demonstrations. In the 
    course of the struggle people begin to take control of their project or building, 
    asking themselves why they should pay rent, how much they should pay, if any, 
    and what it should be used for. At the same time they make sure that the rent 
    collector and the police can&#8217;t carry out their jobs. Anti-eviction squads 
    are set up, and contacts are established with workers in nearby factories 
    who can be brought out immediately. Women play an essential role in the organization 
    of the rent strike. During the day, along with their kids, they guard the 
    project against the police.</p>
  <p>Occupations in Italy have been mass collective actions involving hundreds 
    of people. There has never been any question of legal rights, and there have 
    been many violent clashes with the police, with people defending themselves 
    from behind barricades. The buildings taken over have often been modern blocks 
    of apartments left empty by speculators. In some cases the workers building 
    the apartments have joined in the occupation. Control of the apartments and 
    decisions about how the struggle should be fought are in the hands of general 
    meetings. In the course of the struggle new, collective ways of living have 
    developed; daycare centers, communal kitchens, and people&#8217;s health centers 
    are developed. In this way people begin to live in the buildings in a way 
    which is totally opposed to the idea of isolated, private units for which 
    the architects designed them.</p>
  <p>In Italy people have recognized that rent strikes and occupations are part 
    of the same struggle. &#8220;A house is a right, don&#8217;t pay rent!&#8221; 
    has been a common slogan for both; and in a number of instances, for example 
    in Milan, the same organizations have been used to build rent strikes and 
    to prepare for occupations. This unified struggle around housing has been 
    the pre-condition of the extension of the fight into other areas, such as 
    transportation, health, and prices. All these struggles have relied on direct 
    action: &#8220;Legal&#8221; channels for registering protest or demanding 
    reforms are seen for what they are: delaying tactics used by the ruling class 
    to divide people and buy off their leaders. Appeals to politicians, petitions 
    to Parliament, and the like have been rejected as irrelevant if people are 
    prepared to fight to take now the things that they need. In the modern city 
    the traditional working-class way of life has been increasingly destroyed 
    and replaced by the anonymity of life in the housing project. In the course 
    of their struggles the Italian working class has begun to create for themselves 
    a new identity, a way of life which is more and more outside the control of 
    the bosses. In defining and fighting for their own interests as a class working 
    people have begun to take back everything that has been stolen from them, 
    taking control of their own lives and taking over their cities.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="subtitle">MILAN</p>
<p>Milan is Italy&#8217;s largest industrial city. In addition to large numbers 
  of medium-size factories, there are several huge industrial plants; OM (trucks), 
  Pirelli (tires), Sit Siemens (electrical goods), Alfa-Romeo (cars). Together 
  with Turin it &#8220;attracts&#8221; 2,000 workers a month from the South. During 
  the &#8220;Hot Autumn&#8221; struggles of 1969, these migrant workers were very 
  militant. The most important aspect of these struggles was the lesson they gave 
  people in how to organize on their own behalf and in their own way. At Pirelli, 
  for instance, the fight was organized through the United Base Committee, set 
  up with the support of students. It was this kind of experience which was the 
  pre-condition of the more general struggles which were to develop outside the 
  factories.<br>
  Milan can be divided into four areas:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(a) The City Center: banks, businesses, shops, hotels, and luxury apartments.</p>
  <p>(b) Old working-class areas: from which the workers are being pushed out. 
    These areas are lived in by the traditional Milanese working class, pensioners, 
    small shopkeepers and post-war migrants from the South. Most of these people 
    are eligible for the municipal-housing waiting list. The housing in these 
    areas is a mixture of early, pre-war municipal housing, and very old privately-owned 
    houses which have no amenities. Private owners, the biggest is Ceschini, collect 
    millions in rent. These old working-class neighborhoods have traditions, history, 
    and local community life which make them very different places to live in 
    from the new working-class neighborhoods. In the older neighborhoods, the 
    struggle over housing has developed around making the old apartments livable, 
    rent reduction, and the fight against eviction of tenants, which landlords 
    are keen to attempt in order to be able to renovate the apartments and sell 
    them off to someone with cash. In other cases landlords take in rents and 
    service charges for years without doing any repairs. They let apartments become 
    so run down that they can get permission to knock them down and build luxury 
    apartments in their place.</p>
  <p>(c) Areas of municipal housing where the working classes expelled from the 
    inner-urban area are being re-housed; Quarto Oggiaro, Galaratese, Rodzano, 
    and so on. Also living in these projects are migrant workers with children 
    born in Milan, and a group of scabs, petty-bourgeois, police, civil servants, 
    city guards put there to spy on militant tenants and break down tenants&#8217; 
    solidarity. Municipal housing areas are the heart of housing struggles in 
    Milan.</p>
  <p>(d) Outlying areas: these are places like Bollage, Novate, Desio, Sesto, 
    and Cinisella which have grown up around factories such as Snia, Autobianci, 
    Alfa, and Innocenti. They exist only to provide a place for factory workers 
    to sleep. Even here rents are high ($12.50 a week for a one bedroom apartment, 
    $15.50 a week for a two bedroom apartment), and there are no schools, hospitals, 
    shops, or public transport. The housing here is either co-operatively owned 
    apartments or shanty-town huts which are usually the only accommodation for 
    recently-arrived Southerners.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Housing struggles in Milan have centered on municipal housing. To get a municipal 
  apartment you have to show that you have a steady job, and the waiting period 
  is at least five years. A year&#8217;s residence in Milan is also required before 
  you can get on the waiting list. This immediately excludes recently-arrived 
  Southerners, workers whose work is seasonal (for example, construction workers), 
  the under-employed, the unemployed, and the thousands who don&#8217;t know how 
  to fill in the forms.</p>
<p>In 1964, 5% of the families in municipal housing were in rent arrears. By 1971 
  this had risen to 18%. During this period the housing authorities lost $8,750,000. 
  Ten thousand families received warnings, and there were 750 evictions. At the 
  height of the struggle, 25% of the families in Galaratese were in rent arrears, 
  45% of those in Quarto Oggiaro, and 50% of those in Rodzano.</p>
<p>The struggle began in 1968. In Quarto Oggiaro, when 30,000 families in municipal 
  housing were faced with a 30% rent increase, a Tenants&#8217; Union was created. 
  In that year it made door to door contacts and organized public meetings. By 
  June 1968, 700 families were on total rent strike. The Tenants&#8217; Union 
  spread the struggle with the demand that rent be no more than 10% of wages. 
  In September 1968 four people were arrested during eviction. Kids attacked police 
  cars, and women blocked steps leading to apartments. The Union expanded, and 
  the brutality of the police made people angrier. In April 1970, 500 police were 
  needed to evict one family.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Rent Strike</p>
<p>On May Day 1970 about 2,000 people demonstrated in the streets of Quarto Oggiaro. 
  This was a positive break with the tradition of &#8220;public processions&#8221; 
  organized by the political parties and the trade unions. People were coming 
  onto the streets of their own community. The march was an occasion for people 
  to realize their growing strength and unity and to further develop their struggle. 
  It culminated in a mass meeting held in a square in the center of the district, 
  where a large number of people spoke about their experiences:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>An elderly woman from the area: &#8220;We tenants began our struggle in January 
    1968. I was one of the first women to stop paying rent. Despite the many difficulties, 
    our struggle has developed. The young people of the area have had a lot of 
    trouble, day and night. But our minds are made up. If anyone goes on rent 
    strike, nobody&#8217;s going to be able to evict them. Every time the police 
    come we&#8217;ll be there, all together, in front of the door, to stop them 
    from getting in. Not long ago 500 police were sent down from the Viale Romagna, 
    500 police to throw the family of one poor worker out onto the street. How 
    come, when hundreds of evictions used to be carried out with only one officer 
    there, it now takes a whole army? It&#8217;s because here in Quarto Oggiaro 
    people have got together to fight because here in Quarto Oggiaro there&#8217;s 
    the Tenants&#8217; Union. We&#8217;re using a new type of weapon to fight 
    against the rising cost of living, against the bosses&#8217; exploitation 
    of us in our homes. It&#8217;s something really effective, a rent strike. 
    I&#8217;m not speaking now to the young people, to those youths in the area 
    who have been in the forefront of our struggle. I want to say something to 
    the women who live here. Many of them still aren&#8217;t involved and haven&#8217;t 
    realized the importance of this strike. In the two years and five months that 
    I&#8217;ve been on strike, I&#8217;ve saved a lot of money. I feel healthier. 
    I&#8217;ve had more money to give to the children, to the ones who really 
    need it. I&#8217;ve had some money to give to a few old-age pensioners. I&#8217;m 
    not saying all this to give you big ideas about myself. But just think for 
    a minute. Rather than give your money to the bosses, keep it for yourself. 
    Give it to the children. Give it to the workers who are struggling in the 
    factories and who are exploited, year in and year out. People talk about the 
    Hot Autumn factory contracts. What did the workers gain? Nothing, absolutely 
    nothing I know what my family&#8217;s finances are like. If you do the shopping, 
    you see prices rising every day. I&#8217;d say we&#8217;ve lost out badly. 
    They can laugh, the clever ones, the reformists, all those male politicians. 
    But we&#8217;re getting near election time, and we&#8217;ll give our vote 
    to those who deserve it, and that&#8217;s none of them. Eat sirloin steaks... 
    don&#8217;t go handing your hard-earned money over to the thieves in the Viale 
    Romagna After those 500 police came to Quarto Oggiaro our struggle expanded 
    a hundred times, even the very next day. Anybody who&#8217;s still paying 
    rent just remember this: You won&#8217;t get a penny of it back from the authorities. 
    Follow the example of the young people, even if you don&#8217;t give them 
    responsibilities a lot of the time, seeing as they&#8217;re so young. They&#8217;re 
    much tougher and braver than we are, because after 50 years of struggle we 
    can&#8217;t get the same results we used to. Personally, I can say this. Since 
    the time I first went on rent strike things have gone better for me. Long 
    live the working class! And long live the struggle of the tenants!&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A woman worker from Fiar said, &#8220;After four months of strikes in the factories 
  I was in trouble trying to live on a wage that just wasn&#8217;t enough. I have 
  three children, all of them very young and dear to me. And I just couldn&#8217;t 
  afford the rent I was paying to this private landlord. So they had me evicted. 
  I didn&#8217;t get help from anyone. Then I heard there was a flat empty in 
  Quarto Oggiaro, and I decided to squat in it. Now the authorities have told 
  me I&#8217;ll have to get out in ten days&#8217; time. Well, the authorities 
  had better learn this: I love my kids and I&#8217;m going to make sure that 
  they&#8217;ve got somewhere to live. And I can show them a thing or two. A home 
  is a right, and in the name of that right I&#8217;ve taken one!&#8221; </p>
<p>A worker from Quarto Oggiaro said, &#8220;Comrades, the woman from Fiar who&#8217;s 
  just spoken. . . I think the gist of what she said is quite clear. Here in Quarto 
  Oggiaro, there are dozens of families, apart from those on rent strike, who 
  were in need of a home and have started squatting, without crying or begging 
  for it. Now, the Council, those public-spirited men, have summoned the families 
  to the Town Hall to tell them they&#8217;ve got to get out in the next 10 days. 
  We haven&#8217;t come here just to have a march to celebrate May Day. The sister 
  who&#8217;s just spoken mustn&#8217;t be driven from her home because if we 
  can come here today in such numbers, then the next time there&#8217;ll be more 
  of us. And we&#8217;ll place ourselves in front of this house. The police won&#8217;t 
  kick them out because they won&#8217;t have the strength to do it. Today, May 
  1st, has been decreed by the middle-class politicians as a day to be celebrated. 
  But for us there&#8217;s no cause for celebration, because we&#8217;re still 
  exploited, because they still kick us out of our homes, and because we want 
  a festival that&#8217;s really ours. All the people here know what I&#8217;m 
  trying to say, what festival I&#8217;m talking about. We&#8217;re the ones who 
  build the houses. We&#8217;re the ones who work in the factories. Without the 
  working class there&#8217;d be nothing. Who is it who makes the goods? Who is 
  it who does all the work? Who is it who makes it possible for everyone to benefit? 
  Us! Houses are ours because we build them and need them, and for that reason 
  we&#8217;re going to have them!&#8221;</p>
<p>A speaker from the Tenants&#8217; Union said, &#8220;In June there will be 
  the elections. Before long all the parliamentary vermin will be putting a show 
  on, even in this area. You&#8217;ll see them come making a heap of promises, 
  trying to buy our votes! Even though during ordinary times they treat us as 
  second- class citizens and call the police in on us, when our vote is worth 
  as much as Big Boss Pirelli&#8217;s and they need it to boost their power, what 
  a surprise, they arrive here in person. What a nerve these gentlemen have to 
  come here looking for votes! Look them straight in the face and you&#8217;ll 
  see that they&#8217;re the same ones who order the evictions and who pretend 
  to be indignant when the evictions actually happen. In our area there are hundreds 
  of people who have had rent reductions only because they&#8217;ve jumped on 
  the band wagon of this or that political party. Do we have to do the same? No! 
  We say that housing is a right, built with our money and sweat. So we&#8217;re 
  going to continue the rent strike until we&#8217;ve beaten the bosses and the 
  false friends who try to wreck our struggle. The bosses are doing everything 
  in their power to break our will to fight; intimidation, attempted corruption, 
  violence, etc. There&#8217;s nothing they won&#8217;t stoop to, to try and regain 
  control. They&#8217;ve even given reductions in rent and rent rebates on houses 
  built after 1963. But not one of these maneuvers has worked. Our struggle is 
  still going strong. What the Tenants&#8217; Union is aiming at is to link the 
  struggles in the local factories with those in the community. But, though a 
  link-up of this sort would make us unbeatable, it&#8217;s being obstructed right 
  down the line by the unions because they&#8217;re afraid of losing control over 
  the people, afraid that they won&#8217;t be able to check the thrust of the 
  exploited to develop their own power. To make this clearer, let&#8217;s look 
  at one very concrete example. In February the Office of the Judiciary, together 
  with the police, took advantage of the absence of one tenant to load his furniture 
  out onto the street. Some local women told several comrades, who then began 
  to mobilize. They went and told the workers in a nearby factory, who immediately 
  downed tools and left the factory to protect this man&#8217;s right to a house. 
  In the space of an hour, all the worker&#8217;s furniture was put back in place, 
  the door was closed again, and a new padlock was put on, right before the officer&#8217;s 
  eyes. So far, with the exception of the last time, when there were 500 police 
  on the spot, not one eviction has succeeded because the people here are mobilized 
  and united. In the morning, when the man from the Office of the Judiciary comes 
  around and most of the workers are at work, the chief role is played by the 
  women and children. Once they slashed the tires of a police car, and the cops 
  had to go home on foot! Comrades let&#8217;s carry the message of the rent strike 
  into the factories; let&#8217;s bring together the struggle in the factory and 
  the struggle in the community. In that way we&#8217;ll be able to realize our 
  strength and our power, people&#8217;s power!&#8221;</p>
<p class="subtitle">Occupations</p>
<p>It now became necessary to see the struggle in Quarto Oggiaro as part of the 
  total working&#8212;class struggle, and to extend it to all other aspects of 
  social oppression; prices, health, education, transportation. This led to the 
  picketing of local supermarkets (the UPIM) and the strike of secondary-school 
  kids over the price of books. The people of Quarto Oggiaro have refused to allow 
  their struggle to be diverted or taken over by political parties or other so-called 
  &#8220;representatives&#8221; of the working class. The Tenants&#8217; Union 
  is a mass organization independent of any party or trade union. The CP which 
  wanted to send a petition to Parliament was seen as a joke. What&#8217;s more, 
  people have recognized that the housing struggle cannot be limited to the struggle 
  of tenants and the rent issue. Relying on their own initiatives, they have brought 
  together people on rent strike, people facing eviction, squatters and homeless 
  families. After a number of isolated squats in Quarto Oggiaro and nearby Galaratese, 
  where 10 families occupied a building in September 1970, people began to prepare, 
  through the Tenants&#8217; Union, for the mass occupations which emerged at 
  the beginning of 1971.</p>
<p>On Friday, January 22, 1971, 25 families occupied a modern block of apartments 
  owned and left empty by IACP in via Mac Mahon. All victims of previous evictions, 
  they had been living in special centers set up for &#8220;Homeless Families&#8221;. 
  At the centers anywhere from 5 to 11 people live, sleep, and cook in one or 
  two rooms. Lavatories consist of cramped cupboards, too small even to stand 
  up in. Vermin and disease are rife. Because local bosses regard people housed 
  at the centers as &#8220;unreliable&#8221;, the rate of unemployment is very 
  high. Those who do have work have to travel miles to get it. The apartments 
  that the families moved into were supposedly built for working-class people. 
  They cost 14,000,000 lira ($23,330) in cash, or 22,000,000 lira ($36,660) in 
  installments ($5800 down and just under $120 monthly), obviously way beyond 
  the means of any worker, employed or not. Once inside the apartments the families 
  began to build barricades, hang out red flags, and string up banners. Across 
  the end of the Street was a banner reading &#8220;All Power to the People&#8221;. 
  It wasn&#8217;t long before groups of journalists arrived on the scene, and 
  long arguments started between them and the squatters. The next morning more 
  families arrived. Collections to buy essentials were organized. Other people 
  set out to gain support in the area, touring it with loudspeaker vans and stopping 
  to hold street corner meetings.</p>
<p>At 2:30 the police arrived, about 2,000 of them, armed to the teeth. They immediately 
  surrounded the building and began to attack it from the rear, so as not to be 
  seen from the street. They were very vicious. Canisters of tear gas were fired 
  directly at the people squatting. (This is common police practice nowadays.) 
  About 65 people were eventually taken in for questioning, and 25 of them were 
  arrested. Those who remained were offered transportation back to the &#8220;Homeless 
  Families&#8221; center. This they scornfully refused: &#8220;I came on foot 
  and I&#8217;ll leave on foot.&#8221; Outside a big crowd began to gather. People 
  were forming up to march in protest when the police charged again, using still 
  more tear gas. In spite of this, the march managed to form up, and people set 
  off through the neighborhood to the local market. Here the families decided 
  to occupy the Social Center in Quarto Oggiaro rather than go back to the &#8220;Homeless 
  Families&#8221; center. &#8220;Let the bosses go and live in the center; we&#8217;re 
  not going back.&#8221; Over the next few weeks the Council offered the families 
  a few houses right away and the rest as soon as possible. The families rejected 
  this offer and stuck together until they were all re-housed. When the people 
  arrested during the eviction came to trial, the courtroom was packed and the 
  &#8220;case&#8221; against them was laughed out of court.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Via Tibaldi</p>
<p>The occupation at Via Tibaldi was a great step forward. A whole neighborhood 
  was involved in it : factories, schools, housing projects took part in the organizing 
  of the struggle. There was a victory at Via Tibaldi because everyone there was 
  fully aware of the issue: There were 70 immigrant families who had been promised 
  a place by the Council and had to be re-housed.</p>
<p>When the confrontation came, it was clear who was on which side: It was homeless 
  families, workers, and students against the bosses, the unions, the housing 
  officials, and the police. In the six days of violence the people occupied everything; 
  houses, the streets, the town hall, police wagons, and the Architecture Faculty 
  at the University. Thousands of police were mobilized against those involved 
  in the occupations. In one day there were two attempts to evict everyone. The 
  forces of repression attacked with tear gas, clubbing everyone who got in their 
  way. Twice they were beaten back and after the third attempt to shift them, 
  the occupiers agreed to be re-housed temporarily by a charity. This was a tactical 
  retreat. The mayor and his mob were forced to give in. Houses were allocated 
  to the families who had squatted and to 140 other families who had been evicted 
  and were &#8220;living&#8221; in hostels waiting to be re-housed. The alliance 
  of workers, students, and tenants forged before and during &#8220;the taking 
  of Via Tibaldi&#8221; shows how strong the working class is when it fights together. 
  With this alliance the working class went on the offensive and won a famous 
  victory in June of 1971.</p>
<p>The occupation begins on Tuesday morning squatters are nearly all Southerners, 
  workers at Pirelli and other smaller factories, building workers, and unemployed 
  people. Some of the people have been involved in other struggles: Before this 
  occupation the families from Crescenzago were on rent strike. The occupation 
  is strengthened by a continual coming and going of workers (many of them from 
  OM, a large factory only 150 yards away), students, and local people who support 
  the action. They offer help, bring useful materials, and work alongside the 
  squatters. The workers engaged in building this block of apartments also are 
  sympathetic. The firm they work for is about to close down. Because of the two 
  months of organization which had led up to the occupation the whole of Milan 
  knows about it. Aniasi, the mayor, and the officials of the IACP (the State 
  building authority) know about it too. Almost at the same time they both start 
  denying responsibility. Barricades are built in the streets, particularly by 
  the women and children.</p>
<p>Wednesday: A demonstration is organized to go to Porta Ticinese. It&#8217;s 
  the Festival of the Navigilo, and people figure Aniasi will be there. The families 
  want to have a few words with him and let him know that they&#8217;re ready 
  for anything. The march is headed by a banner that reads &#8220;Homes Occupied 
  &#8220;. There are dozens of red flags. The marchers move off shouting &#8220;We 
  want houses NOW&#8220;, &#8220;Free houses for workers!&#8221;, and &#8220;Long 
  live Communism!&#8221; When they reach Porta Ticinese they find that Aniasi 
  has left. So everyone climbs up onto the rostrum and occupies it for a while. 
  Then, with more and more people joining in, they set off back to the apartment 
  building.</p>
<p>Thursday: The families decide that the struggle must become more militant. 
  Twenty or so people go to the Marino Palace, to a meeting of the Council. Once 
  again they refuse to listen. A room in the Town Hall is occupied from 5 pm till 
  midnight. When they get back to the Via Tibaldi there&#8217;s a meeting of heads 
  of families which decides that the struggle must continue to the bitter end. 
  Nobody so much as mentions the idea of abandoning the building. By now the whole 
  of Milan knows that we are in the Via Tibaldi, and new families continue to 
  arrive. The people who occupied and won the apartments in Mac Mahon come to 
  give us support. There&#8217;s also a lot of discussion about new forms of struggle. 
  Over the next few days a huge demonstration is organized to show that we have 
  no intention of giving in.</p>
<p>Friday: after Catalano arrives, sent by the Town Hall and IACP. This official 
  has a reputation for cramming workers into shanty towns after having promised 
  them homes. Catalano wants a list of the families involved. He gets it, but 
  he&#8217;s also tried by a genuine People&#8217;s Tribunal. People tell him 
  what they think of him, that he&#8217;s nothing but a lackey of the bosses, 
  a rat and an exploiter. A crowd of workers surround him, shouting: &#8220;We&#8217;re 
  going to have the apartments, and you can get stuffed for the rents!&#8221; 
  He was really swaggering when he arrived; but by the time he leaves, several 
  hours later, he&#8217;s pale and trembling. And he&#8217;s had to give the squatters 
  some solid commitments.</p>
<p>Saturday: The mobilization continues. In the afternoon another barricade is 
  built in the streets.</p>
<p>Sunday morning: Two thousand cops arrive to clear out the Via Tibaldi. The 
  Town Hall and the bosses have decided that they have to put down these people 
  who, in six days of struggle, have become a reference point and an organization 
  center for the whole working class of Milan. All the squatters know that they 
  had a right to defend what they had taken and what was rightfully theirs. But 
  it&#8217;s more a question of building our strength and using it at the right 
  time. On Sunday morning we are still too weak. After long arguments with the 
  police the squatters decide to leave the building and move to the Architecture 
  Faculty of the University, at the invitation of the students.</p>
<p>Sunday evening: 3,000 police arrive to throw everyone out of the Architecture 
  Faculty. They think it will be as easy as it was in the morning. They couldn&#8217;t 
  be more mistaken. While the police squads take up their positions, a meeting 
  of all the families decides that this time they have to defend themselves, and 
  that they&#8217;re strong enough to do it and the cops are going to pay for 
  the eviction from Via Tibaldi. Once again all the organization comes from the 
  squatting families; women and children on the upper floors, all the men down 
  below behind the gates, facing the riot squad. At 11 pm the cops charge. But 
  they get their fingers burned. They hadn&#8217;t expected the fierce and powerful 
  reaction from the people inside the building, or the attack from behind by people 
  who haven&#8217;t managed to get inside. When they eventually manage to force 
  their way into the building, the police find no one there. Everyone has managed 
  to get out and is regrouping in the streets, ready to carry on the fight. Having 
  run out of tear gas, the riot squad retreats, completely disoriented, and charged 
  by the squatters. We lose count of the jeeps demolished by stones. The whole 
  thing lasts until two in the morning.</p>
<p>Monday morning: Members of all the families meet up on the university campus. 
  They are all there; people decide to go along to a meeting of the architecture 
  students. Here, in the afternoon, some of the squatters are chosen to explain 
  the struggle In Via Tibaldi. A proposal is made that closer links be created 
  between the students&#8217; struggle and that of the homeless. On the basis 
  of this proposal the meeting decides that the families should occupy the Architecture 
  Faculty again later that day. As for the Faculty Board, they decide to initiate 
  a permanent seminar on the housing problem with the people from Via Tibaldi 
  who are &#8220;experts&#8221; on the subject.<br>
  At the Architecture Faculty, as always, decisions about how to carry on the 
  struggle are made solely by the assembly of families, which meets twice a day. 
  During one of these meetings a huge demonstration is suggested for the following 
  Saturday. This will help to bring home the meaning of the struggle to those 
  who aren&#8217;t directly involved. This demonstration is to mobilize 30,000 
  people!</p>
<p>Wednesday: Five o&#8217;clock in the morning the police surround the whole 
  university precinct in three huge circles. Traffic is at a complete standstill. 
  It&#8217;s a trial of strength. 250 students are arrested plus a dozen lecturers 
  and even the Dean of the Faculty! The families are carried off once more in 
  police vans. A few hours later, a general assembly held at the Polytechnic also 
  is broken up by the police. Vittoria, the Chief of Police, De Peppo, the General 
  Procurator of the Republic, and Aniasi, the Mayor, think they have finally beaten 
  what was originally no more than a few dozen families, but what became the symbol 
  of Milan&#8217;s working class. They couldn&#8217;t have been more mistaken!</p>
<p>Wednesday dinnertime: All the families eat at the canteen of the ACLI (Action 
  Group of Italian Catholic Workers), where they have been given shelter. From 
  now on no one can avoid the struggle in Via Tibaldi. The ruling class are caught 
  in enormous contradictions trying to reconcile the demands which are coming 
  from every direction from a section of the PSI and local councilors; from the 
  CP and the ACLI, which they&#8217;d always thought were under their thumb; from 
  the FIM (one of the metal workers&#8217; unions whose members are particularly 
  militant). Some orders are coming from Rome and others from local employers. 
  The greatest danger is that the struggle will spread. This is what is giving 
  them nightmares. And the families do everything in their power to make it happen 
  by organizing Saturday&#8217;s demonstration, by going to the factory gates 
  with placards and leaflets, by sending a delegation to the congress of the ACLI 
  and to the general assembly of the student movement, where they are given a 
  tumultuous reception. And before every action is taken, the assembly of families 
  decides what should be said, what line to take, and what proposals to put forward.</p>
<p>As for Aniasi and Company, their goose is cooked. Catalano, the same messenger 
  boy who&#8217;d come so arrogantly to the Via Tibaldi, now hurries to the ACLI 
  with an offer. &#8220;Too vague&#8221;, say the families. &#8220;Your words 
  and promises won&#8217;t be enough to solve the housing problem now. We want 
  an agreement written and signed by Aniasi and the Council.&#8221; Two hours 
  later the agreement is there.</p>
<p>Before July 31, the Council will allocate 200 apartments, not only to the families 
  from the Via Tibaldi, but also to 140 others in a similar situation. Each family 
  will receive 100,000 lira ($1,665) compensation, plus 15,000 lira ($250) for 
  each member of the family. There&#8217;s no stipulation of three months&#8217; 
  deposit before moving into the apartments. All evictions and all rent arrears 
  are frozen by the Council. During this fortnight of struggle none of the squatters 
  has ever imagined that the workers&#8217; fight about housing would end at Via 
  Tibaldi, or that the only problem is how to get a new home. This struggle is 
  only a beginning. Now the families want to help organize the struggle against 
  rents, fares, and prices. A lot of work needs to be done circulating information 
  around local factories. For this reason the assembly of families from Via Tibaldi 
  has become permanent, involving people from every district in Milan. </p>
<p class="subtitle">ROME</p>
<p>Rome is one of the first stops on the route which takes people forced off the 
  land in the South on to the Industrial cities of the North. Between 1951 and 
  1969 the population of the city grew by an average of 60,000 a year. There are 
  few regular jobs for these migrants, since apart from service industries and 
  construction most of the work there is clerical and is handed out as a &#8220;favor&#8221; 
  on the say-so of local politicians. There are 40,000 people unemployed, many 
  of them young people. Since it is ruling class policy to make workers move to 
  the industrial jobs In the North, hardly any low-rent municipal housing is built 
  in Rome. There are 100,000 families living in the outlying slums. Construction 
  workers, newly arrived immigrants, unemployed workers, pensioners; they live 
  either in shanty towns or in apartments shared by several families. Another 
  62,000 families live in private accommodations, paying rents of between 40,000 
  and 80,000 lira ($650 to $1300 a month). he struggle for cheaper housing began 
  in 1969 when people started to occupy luxury apartments in the city center left 
  empty by speculators (Tufello: 125 families Celio: 225 families; Via Pigafetta 
  155 families; Via Prati: 290 families). The struggle soon spread to families 
  living in tenements, who went on rent strikes and developed collective ways 
  of fighting evictions. Since the people from the shanty towns have nothing to 
  lose, their struggles have often been direct and violent. Before leaving their 
  huts they have often burned them to the ground, determined never to return. 
  In recent struggles construction workers have played an important role. At Via 
  Albocciorle construction workers joined 205 families to occupy the houses they 
  had just built.</p>
<p class="subtitle">The Peoples&#8217; Clinic: June 1971</p>
<p>In San Basilio, one of Rome&#8217;s outlying ghetto areas, a movement has been 
  developing of people fighting against their lousy, inhuman living conditions. 
  There are 40,000 people trapped in this slum district. In the past few months 
  about 100 families have been on rent strike. This started as a spontaneous protest, 
  and now it&#8217;s becoming more organized. A real confrontation is building 
  up with the IACP over exorbitant rents, arrears, and threats of eviction. The 
  rent strike is becoming a major issue for the whole community, with mass meetings, 
  protest marches, and demonstrations. Last weekend there was a meeting to integrate 
  the results of a large number of staircase meetings. About 800 families have 
  been involved in these meetings, which were organized by the San Basillo Collective, 
  a group of women and workers from the area, along with a number of students.</p>
<p>At this central meeting there was a discussion of new plans of action and ideas 
  which had been put forward by local people. There was very heavy criticism of 
  the lack of medical facilities in the area; no first-aid station and no clinic, 
  with the nearest medical center being the clinic at the hospital in Rome. It 
  was decided to start a fight to set up a clinic and a decent medical center 
  in the area.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, after a deputation had gone to the Council for the nth time and 
  still had not been received, a decision was made to occupy the neighborhood 
  Ises Center. The occupation took place after a meeting and demonstration which 
  had gone right around the neighborhood. The involvement of women, workers, and 
  young people and the support expressed by local residents prevented any action 
  or attempts at intimidation by the police.</p>
<p>The people who took over the Center formed themselves into a permanent assembly 
  which stayed there all night. They sent out an appeal to all Left-wing doctors 
  to get in touch with them. Meanwhile people talked about the inhuman conditions 
  under which they live, which are the cause of many of their illnesses. They 
  realized that if you&#8217;re going to get rid of sickness you have to do away 
  with exploitation in the factories where people breathe in smog and break their 
  backs on the production lines, and at the construction sites, where people work 
  in rain, dust, and mud. For years now people have been lining up at the health-insurance 
  clinics only to be given the usual pill and then told not to be a pest. They&#8217;re 
  fed up with taking pills and drugs which do nothing but make drug manufacturers 
  rich. They&#8217;re tired of doctors and others who live off their illnesses. 
  They&#8217;re sick and tired of being patched up so that they can carry on working 
  and producing for the boss, then falling ill again and having to go back for 
  further repairs.</p>
<p>People also want decent places to live where typhus and hepatitis aren&#8217;t 
  rampant because of bad drainage and sewers. And they want enough money to buy 
  decent food. There aren&#8217;t enough green spaces in the area, and as someone 
  said: &#8220;These apartments were built for getting sick in, not for living 
  in.&#8221; San Basillo wasn&#8217;t built to cater to people&#8217;s needs; 
  it was built to satisfy the plans of the bosses. &#8220;San Basilio is like 
  FIAT&#8217;S shanty towns in Turin&#8221;, said one construction worker. &#8220;At 
  least it has the same function, to keep the workers out of the way.&#8221;</p>
<p>On Sunday there was a huge meeting of all the people in San Basilio, and a 
  festival to inaugurate the &#8220;People&#8217;s Clinic&#8221;, which is by 
  now fully operational. Eighty workers, women, and young people met with the 
  doctors in the main hall of the center. A long banner was hung up with the slogan 
  which sums up the way people feel: &#8220;The only way to get anything is through 
  struggle.&#8221;</p>
<p>At this meeting the role of the clinic was defined. As one woman said, &#8220;This 
  clinic is more than something which responds to the real needs of the people 
  here. It is a first step toward ending our exploitation.&#8221;</p>
<p>The People&#8217;s Clinic is run by doctors who lend their services to everyone 
  free of charge, giving out free medicine and medical attention, particularly 
  to the kids who are forced to play in the streets, which are full of broken 
  glass and rubbish. The clinic is also a center for political discussion and 
  for organizing other struggles which are being waged in the area, whether to 
  the fight against the fascists and the police, or the running of the rent strike 
  and the squatting. The task of the doctors is not just limited to lending their 
  &#8220;services&#8221;, in fact, but extends to participating in all the struggles 
  in the area and to passing on their specialized knowledge so the people can 
  start to control their own health.</p>
<p class="subtitle">San Basilio</p>
<p>San Basilio is a small working-class city outside Rome. A wave of housing struggles 
  began here in April 1971. The local politicians attempted to contain the struggle 
  by channeling it back into safe ways: upcoming elections. On Tuesday, May 6, 
  the first clash between squatting tenants and politicians erupted. From 9 pm 
  to midnight the local population of San Basilio was mobilized against an election 
  meeting held by the Christian Democrat mayor, Darida. The meeting had been called 
  unexpectedly, without even so much as a poster on the wall. Obviously the idea 
  was to wrap everything up in the space of half an hour. Just a visit, an appearance, 
  and then a quick getaway from this area which could certainly not be expected 
  to be friendly to a unionist who, only a few days before, had shaken hands with 
  the leader of the Fascists, Almirante. At the time fixed for the meeting there 
  were already 100 to 150 people in the market place. The enormous number of police 
  standing around was a sure sign that the Christian Democrats who were coming 
  to speak were hostile.</p>
<p>So, this is what happened: Under the rostrum, an immense and pompous affair, 
  there were roughly 15 electoral agents. Just behind was everyone else, all the 
  working-class people, women, and young people of the area, as well as a few 
  people from the CP. Groups formed, and people started to talk about the past 
  20 years of promises&#8230;the promises of all the mayors&#8230; the promises 
  of this mayor. People decided to interrupt the speech and get a woman and a 
  worker from the area to speak. At last it got under way. But the Mayor hadn&#8217;t 
  had the nerve to come. Instead it was Medi, the professor, the one who&#8217;s 
  been so active in the anti-divorce campaign, the guy that the whole of Italy 
  have had the chance to &#8220;admire&#8221; on their TV screens as a brilliant 
  commentator on the, space exploits of the Americans.</p>
<p>Right from the start he began spouting a load of bullshit: &#8220;How fortunate 
  you are to be living outside the city, in an unpolluted atmosphere.&#8221; There 
  was an immediate barrage of catcalls and slogans shouted at the top of people&#8217;s 
  voices. Medi reacted stupidly in front of this group of workers: &#8220;You&#8217;re 
  all barbarians, and the city of Rome will wipe you out. . . . You&#8217;ve got 
  no brains and can&#8217;t understand what I&#8217;m trying to tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>It went on like this for an hour, until 10 pm, with women pressing against 
  the rostrum and the police, in confusion, not knowing how to control dozens 
  of kids who were going round and round the orator in a line, howling into jam 
  jars and making one hell of a dinner, and the professor? He was still at it, 
  shouting insults: &#8220;You&#8217;re like donkeys . . . it&#8217;s easy to 
  see that you&#8217;ve never been to school.&#8221; This remark was followed 
  by a volley of eggs. Medi turned to the police and demanded that they take control 
  of the situation. The cops put on their gas masks. People retreated. The police 
  threw the first tear gas. The meeting ended. &#8220;Rome will sort your lot 
  out, you barbarians; we&#8217;ll win, don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>
<p>People came down from the blocks of flats. By now there were more than a thousand 
  people. The police had remained grouped in the market place and continued to 
  hurl tear gas at the windows and at women. One moment people saw a cop setting 
  off on a bike; the next the reinforcements had arrived, about 40 lorryloads, 
  more than 700 police in riot gear. Provenza, the Vice Commissioner of Police, 
  also arrived, to take command of the operation. The area was besieged. The police, 
  foolishly, decided to go into a block of flats and start beating people up. 
  They were met by a continuous and very violent volley of plates, bottles, and 
  anything else that people could lay their hands on.</p>
<p>The police withdrew, and finally left the area. It was a little after midnight. 
  In the market place, people set fire to the rostrum. Groups formed. People worked 
  out who had been arrested and who had been injured. People tried to find out 
  news about those who had been arrested.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Don&#8217;t Vote, Occupy!</p>
<p>By June 1971, with regional elections only a few days away, all the political 
  parties talked about was &#8220;law and order&#8221;. The CP was making vague 
  promises about housing reforms: something people were very preoccupied with. 
  After an assembly in San Basilio, 20 families decided to occupy a block of flats 
  on Saturday, the 5th. The occupation was a failure, since the flats are privately 
  owned and impossible to defend. The families decided to turn back and wait a 
  few days.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the 9th, there were occupations at Centrocelle and Pietralate. 
  At Centocelle, the police responded immediately: they tried to arrest an isolated 
  comrade. The squatters reacted immediately, and managed to free him. A police 
  car was smashed up, and another six or seven showed up with their sirens wailing. 
  We woke up the neighborhood with megaphones, denouncing the police&#8217;s attack. 
  People came out of their houses shouting to the police &#8220;This is our area; 
  get the hell out of it, the police were forced to leave.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at Pietralate, the occupation had gone off successfully, so we decided 
  to go there and have one large squat. At the beginning there were 70 families. 
  During the night 30 more arrived. The occupation got more organized. Doctors 
  were found. Staircase assemblies were arranged and people were appointed to 
  take charge of each staircase. During the night our assembly decided that if 
  the police came to evict us, we would all stick together and regroup somewhere 
  else to continue the struggle.</p>
<p>Early in the morning of the 10th the CP officials arrived. At first they tried 
  to persuade us to go back home. (Where to?) Then they turned to insulting us 
  by saying we were gypsies and thieves. In the meantime the police had arrived 
  and surrounded the block. When they entered the courtyard we all came down, 
  trying to stay together. But 12 of us were separated off and threatened with 
  arrest. At this point the women attacked furiously. They started pushing against 
  the police cordons and demanded the immediate release of everyone. It was a 
  great moment. The police didn&#8217;t know how to react; they were being attacked 
  by women and kids. At first they tried to push them away violently, but in the 
  end they were forced to release everyone. We all shouted and cheered loudly.</p>
<p>At an assembly in the afternoon, people had a go at the CP and all other reformists. 
  We decided to occupy again so that the struggle wouldn&#8217;t lose its momentum. 
  That evening we occupied in the Magliana district, 70 families and their friends. 
  A police car that got in the way was smashed; the police fired in the air; a 
  police car that came toward us was stoned. At three in the morning the whole 
  area was surrounded by riot police. We held an assembly in the courtyard and 
  decided to march from the houses toward the police lines. This decision was 
  not unanimous. Some of us wanted to stay and defend the flats. In the end we 
  all marched out shouting slogans. People came to the windows. When we got to 
  Via Magliana the police charged. Fighting was violent. There were 60 arrests. 
  Many of us were kept in jail for hours. After this eviction, we decided to hold 
  meetings in different neighborhoods of the city. Many people decided not to 
  take part in the elections and to make sure the struggle goes on.</p>
<p class="subtitle">THE SOUTH</p>
<p>Since its beginning, Italy&#8217;s economic development has been uneven, the 
  North growing faster than the South. High unemployment and low wages have forced 
  millions to migrate. During the boom years, 1959 to 1963, almost a million people 
  traveled north. This process has been accelerated by the mechanization of agriculture. 
  Between 1951 and 1970 the number of people working the land fell from 7,200,000 
  to 3,800,000 out of a labor force holding nearly constant around 20,000,000. 
  As in other Common Market countries, only the larger farmers prospered.</p>
<p>To stop this migration, the Government set up the Cassa del Mezzogiorno (Bank 
  of the South). Initially its function was to provide subsidies to agriculture 
  and help create social infrastructures (houses, roads, schools, hospitals). 
  Its failure to make any significant change led to its roles becoming more and 
  more to provide investment for factories. The factories that were built were 
  all state-owned:</p>
<p>Alfa Romeo in Naples, Italsider (steel) in Taranto and Naples, chemical plants 
  in Ban and Porto Torres on Sardinia. The building of these factories provided 
  the first job for many of the workers coming off the land. But since it takes 
  far fewer workers to run these ultra-modern factories than to build them, unemployment 
  in these Southern cities has risen quickly in recent years and will remain high, 
  since no other Industries can develop to complement the few existing factories.</p>
<p>Very little has been done to build enough schools, houses, and hospitals to 
  cope with the growing population of these cities. The working class is controlled 
  by a mixture of overt repression and political corruption, and the only hope 
  of a place to live lies in becoming a member of a political organization. Frustration 
  erupts in angry, violent outbursts, for instance in Battipaglia, where days 
  of rioting followed the closure of a local factory. Over the past few years 
  there have been a growing number of housing occupations (Salerno: 80 families; 
  Torre del Greco; Messina: 328 families; Carbonia: 130 families). In Syracuse, 
  where houses are usually allocated to the &#8220;clients of local political 
  bosses, people&#8217;s anger became so great that new tenants had to take possession 
  of their apartments under heavy police protection. Other projects which had 
  been walled up before they were finished had their entrances smashed open by 
  violent demonstrators.</p>
<p class="subtitle">TARANTO<br>
  Occupation of GESCAL apartments</p>
<p>In December 1970, 200 families occupied apartments belonging to GESCAL (the 
  State housing authority) in the working-class district of Tamburi. They had 
  been living in the slum tenements in Via Lisippo. Police threats and vague promises 
  from the Council had no effect on them. People had gotten it into their heads 
  to take direct action. They took the initiative themselves, going around from 
  tenement to tenement, organizing and bringing people together.</p>
<p>One of the activists said: &#8220;We have abandoned all faith in politicians, 
  people who come round every five years asking us to vote for them. They say 
  they&#8217;ll give us work and homes, but every time they just leave us where 
  we are, in the cold and damp. We hate them all, because they live off our slavery. 
  And they do everything in their power to make sure people don&#8217;t rebel 
  and take what is rightfully theirs. Because we&#8217;ve behaved ourselves, because 
  we&#8217;ve listened to their promises, dozens of children have died in the 
  slums where we live. We have all had illnesses, and we have all suffered. We 
  shall bear these marks within us for ever. The people who have our suffering 
  on their consciences will be made to pay dearly, pay the whole price. We organized 
  the occupation the evening of December 2. Within a few hours the slums were 
  empty, but the GESCAL apartments were full. Now the apartments are OURS. We 
  haven&#8217;t got water or electricity yet, but we&#8217;re already getting 
  water from down in the courtyard, and we&#8217;re trying to organize the provision 
  of supplies for every apartment. And as far as the electricity is concerned, 
  we&#8217;ll see about that too. Meanwhile we&#8217;ve begun cleaning the place 
  up. It&#8217;s never very nice wearing yourself out with this sort of work, 
  but at least it&#8217;s a bit more satisfying than sweeping out the rat holes 
  we were living in before. We&#8217;re happy. We&#8217;re confident in ourselves 
  and our own strength. We&#8217;ve organized in each building and made links 
  between buildings. We intend to keep these apartments, and we need to organize 
  to keep the police out. We&#8217;ve had a couple of meetings everyday to talk 
  over any problems, to clarify our ideas, and to decide what has to be done. 
  We&#8217;re keeping in contact with other people in the area, and trying to 
  spread the word to people in the factories. On Sunday, December 6, we had our 
  first general meeting. This was important because it meant that we could all 
  get together, and we could also talk to workers, women and children, and unemployed 
  people from different parts of the city. It wasn&#8217;t just the people from 
  the slums who organized this occupation. The initiative came from there, but 
  it quickly spread to other parts of the city. The people in the old part of 
  the city, the street cleaners, the fishermen, and the unemployed were particularly 
  quick to act. Today there&#8217;s not one apartment left empty in all these 
  buildings. But we know that there are many other buildings empty around here 
  and in other parts of the city. We&#8217;ve got to find out where they are, 
  because the whole city is in ferment, and all the working-class people want 
  to occupy houses.&#8221;</p>
 <p class="subtitle">PALERMO<br>
  Red Flags over the IACP&#8212;April 1971</p>
<p>The NEZ (Northern Expansion Zone) is an IACP estate about 10 miles outside 
  Palermo. About a thousand families live there, mostly unemployed building workers, 
  clerical workers who occasionally work on the land, and fishermen. These families 
  are mostly earthquake victims from the Western Sicily earthquake disaster of 
  June 1968. They took possession of the houses after they had been requisitioned 
  by the Prefect. Many people simply squatted in them. Of course the IACP regards 
  this occupation as &#8220;illegal&#8221; and it has started sending out injunctions 
  for the payment of arrears: 30,000 lira ($500) per flat. On Thursday, March 
  27, there was an occupation of a block of flats that were still being built. 
  The police came to evict people, but the houses were occupied again, and this 
  time the people stayed there.</p>
<p>Since the building was still not finished, the squatters themselves organized 
  to get the drains working and set up electrical supplies and so on. On Sunday 
  there was a mass meeting to discuss the problem of the injunction. There were 
  300 people there, mostly women, who are the most active and determined people 
  in this fight. A strike of the whole area was scheduled to begin the next day, 
  and a platform was approved including flats to be provided officially for everyone; 
  cancellation of all arrears of rents; building of roads, schools, and all the 
  amenities which are totally lacking in the area; and self-determination of contributions. 
  The people of the NEZ area don&#8217;t want to talk in terms of rent, because 
  they don&#8217;t agree with the idea of paying rent. But they are prepared to 
  provide a small contribution, according to what they can afford, for the building 
  of new homes.<br>
  The next day (Monday), beginning at 4:30 in the morning, the whole area was 
  at a standstill. There were pickets on the street corners, as well as a large 
  contingent of police. People gathered in the Central Square, and at 8:30 am 
  a march set off in the direction of Palermo. Women and children rode in cars 
  and trucks, and men walked. Throughout the march the police continually provoked 
  people. The marchers arrived at the IACP offices in Palermo. The police set 
  up a cordon across the road, but the marchers broke through the lines and about 
  50 demonstrators managed to get into the building. Others got in over the balconies 
  and through windows. Inside the IACP there was a huge commotion: For once the 
  tables were turned on the people who govern our lives. When the women came into 
  the building all the officials beat a hasty retreat. The President of the IACP 
  appeared, pale and trembling, and agreed to speak to some sort of &#8220;delegation&#8221;. 
  He tried to evade their questions and give nothing away. But the demonstrators 
  decided to occupy the Institute. Meanwhile the people who had stayed outside 
  began to mobilize other people in Palermo. The Base Committee from the shipyards 
  arrived, and also a number of working people from other parts of town. This 
  struggle became a reference point for everyone. For the bosses and bureaucrats 
  things were getting too hot, Two hours later the President returned and announced 
  that he was going to withdraw the injunctions for rent arrears. For the time 
  being people decided to leave the Institute (by then it was 6 pm), but the struggle 
  for these objectives was to go on. The most active of all the people were the 
  women, the true militants of this day of struggle and clashes with the police. 
  Among other things, they succeeded in freeing a comrade who had been arrested 
  by the police.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Palermo, 1973</p>
<p>Early this year building workers took over a block of luxury flats they have 
  just finished building. They moved in with their families and other working 
  class people. Police were called by the local CP administration, but could not 
  gain access to the barricaded block of flats.</p>
<p class="subtitle">NAPLES</p>
<p>The local capitalists have hardly invested in industry, finding it more profitable 
  to make money in real estate and tourism, as well as through Mafia-run industries 
  like prostitution and smuggling. The main sources of employment are various 
  forms of hustling. Children, who are particularly successful at this, play an 
  important role within the economy of the family. Unlike other cities, in which 
  schools are places where kids are accustomed to the discipline of work, in Naples 
  working-class children are systematically discouraged from attending school. 
  In this situation, the struggle to keep a school open takes on a wholly-different 
  dimension: parents are refusing t0 allow the system to put their children on 
  the streets.</p>
<p>February 1970. Secondigilo is an Ina Casa housing development on the outskirts 
  of Naples. It&#8217;s one of the many dormitory suburbs into which the bosses 
  shove all the people they don&#8217;t want around the city center. Go back 10 
  years, and it wasn&#8217;t so bad, at least on the map. But it wasn&#8217;t 
  long before it became clear that the map was only for show. No one had any intention 
  of making it a reality by making the area a pleasure for people to live in. 
  A dump of a flat was enough; there were no decent streets, no services, no schools, 
  no parks.... (These things aren&#8217;t profitable for the investors). There 
  are about 14,000 people there. About 2,000 of them are people who, having waited 
  10, 20, or even 30 years in hovels, have now been re-housed in apartments without 
  adequate windows, without water, without drains, without furniture, without 
  light.</p>
<p>The first struggle in Secondiglio was for a primary school. People wanted a 
  prefabricated building to hold a thousand children, and the promise of a proper 
  building before too long. About 40% of the children attending school are at 
  least a year behind the normal. Another 30% are two years behind the normal. 
  About three months after the beginning of the school year at least a year, many 
  kids get demoralized and stop coming. And then came the &#8220;motherly&#8221; 
  advice of the schoolmistress: &#8220;School&#8217;s not for you. Why don&#8217;t 
  you get a job?&#8221; The worst crime of all is the way kids are made to believe 
  that school only runs up to the 6th grade (primary) level. Local industry couldn&#8217;t 
  supply itself with cheap labor otherwise. As a result, 90% of the &#8220;educated&#8221; 
  have only a primary school certificate, and 30% are illiterate. What&#8217;s 
  more, the children are highly vulnerable to all kinds of illnesses. Large numbers 
  of kids have rheumatic fever, heart conditions, bronchial pneumonia, and so 
  on. School is a place to catch diseases, just one more reason for not going. 
  The kids spend the whole day hanging around the area in a freaked-out state. 
  But they&#8217;re still not too young to learn how to hustle . . . so many families 
  have someone in Poggiorale prison or Filangeri juvenile prison.</p>
<p>After nine years of demands, a miniature school was opened. From the outside 
  it looked beautiful, but inside there was no electricity or heating, and the 
  children shivered with cold. They had to go to school wearing hats and scarves. 
  After two weeks the new school was closed, and the kids went back to their old 
  shanty hut of a school. But now there were too many of them, so the school had 
  to be run in two shifts. The results are exactly the same as before. Few kids 
  go to school, there&#8217;s a high turnover of teachers, and no one studies. 
  No one does anything. It wasn&#8217;t long before people had had enough. So 
  they began to organize and prepare for a fight. They held a meeting and organized 
  marches in the neighborhood. The kids came out on strike. They felt that they 
  had to carry the struggle beyond the area. So groups of parents went to the 
  center of Naples, to the Department of Education and to the Town Hall. They 
  shook up the bureaucracy: &#8220;We&#8217;ve had enough of rubber stamps and 
  promises. We want the school reopened immediately, with the electricity turned 
  on.&#8221;</p>
<p>The various officials responsible were really scared but it still wasn&#8217;t 
  enough to get them off their backsides and make them finish the building. People 
  realized that they were in for another swindle, and immediately began organizing 
  again.</p>
<p>They cordoned off the school with chains, and a large number of people went 
  to the Town Hall to put pressure on the officials. They forced the authorities 
  to come to the area the next day so they could see for themselves what things 
  were like. The headmaster and the teachers joined in what was going on, though 
  they&#8217;d accepted shoddy treatment for years. From now on the school will 
  be run on different lines, because the community is taking direct control over 
  every aspect of its running. </p>
