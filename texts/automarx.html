<p>The Italian 'Hot Autumn' of 1969 was one of the high points of late 20th century 
  revolutionary struggle, and is associated with <I><I>operaismo</I></I> ('workerism'), 
  a Marxian approach that focused on rank-and-file struggles in contrast to what 
  was seen as the politics and opportunism of the dominant (Stalinist) left. The 
  wave of social struggles of that year was echoed, although with important differences, 
  in the tumultuous 'Movement of 1977'. Under the banner of <I>autonomia</I>, 
  the workerists' analysis of class struggle was extended through the actions 
  of groups outside the workplace. Intense street-fighting, self-reduction or 
  outright refusal of bills and fares, the explicit raising of radical demands 
  such as the abolition of wage-labour: all this hinted at a movement for which 
  what counts as 'political' had been seriously questioned by struggles around 
  wider desires and needs. Readers will be aware of workerism and <I>autonomia</I> 
  today through the works of its most well-known theorists, such as Negri, through 
  the US journal <I>Midnight Notes</I>, and perhaps through the aut-op-sy website 
  and discussion list.<A NAME="[1]" HREF="#[1]B">[1]</A> For many of those dissatisfied 
  with the versions of Marxism and anarchism available to them in the UK, the 
  notions of 'autonomy' and 'autonomist' have positive associations. For example, 
  the recent 'anti-capitalist' mobilizations of J18 and Seattle both drew on themes 
  and language associated with <I>autonomia</I>, such as autonomous struggles 
  and diversity.<A NAME="[2]" HREF="#[2]B">[2]</A> However, the history and theory 
  surrounding workerism and <I>autonomia</I> are not always well known. The recent 
  publication of two books on <I><I>operaismo</I></I> and <I>autonomia</I> and 
  their theoretical heritage testify to the continued interest in this current. 
  Harry Cleaver's <I>Reading 'Capital' Politically</I> was originally published 
  in 1979, and has now been republished, with a new preface. Cleaver's Introduction, 
  in particular, has been a point of reference to many in grasping the significance 
  of post-war developments, including struggles that don't necessarily express 
  themselves in traditional forms. Steve Wright's <I><I>Storming heaven</I></I> 
  presents a critical history of the Italian movement's political and theoretical 
  development in relation to the struggles of the 1950s, '60s and '70s - a history 
  which, we argue, now supersedes the Cleaver presentation.</P>
<P>The publication of these two books gives us the opportunity for a critical 
  reappraisal of the contributions of <I><I>operaismo</I></I> and <I>autonomia</I>, 
  and Cleaver's attempt to keep them alive. In particular, we will examine five 
  issues. First, there is the question of whether the concept of 'autonomy' is 
  adequate as a basis for a class analysis. Second, we argue that the workerists 
  and hence those who have followed them suffered from a lack of an adequate critique 
  of leftism and nationalism. Third, there is the issue of the ambiguity of those 
  influenced by workerism in their account of the status of the 'law of value'. 
  Fourth, the failure of workerism and of <I>autonomia</I> to theorize retreat 
  in the class struggle can be linked to an implicit (or even explicit) satisfaction 
  among some theorists in this tradition with the current limits of the class 
  struggle. Finally, there is the question of whether the political reading of 
  Marx's <I>Capital</I> offered by Cleaver actually works. We conclude that the 
  defeat of the movements that sustained the development of workerism has led 
  both to the abandonment of the project of world revolution and the ideologization 
  of theory among theorists in this tradition.<BR>
<p class=subtitle>1. Promise and limits of an 'autonomist' class analysis</P>

<P>To understand the workerist and the subsequent 'autonomist Marxist' take on class we need to go back to the emergence of the current's key theoretical concepts.<P>

<P><B>1.1 Classical Workerism</B><BR>
  The origins of <I>operaismo</I> lie in research carried out on workers' behaviour 
  in the 1950s. The concern of the research was with workers' own needs and perceptions: 
  their definitions of their problems on the shopfloor, and the nature of their 
  struggles. Wright (p. 63) cites the following as the core features of the workerist 
  perspective emerging from this research: the identification of the working class 
  with the labour subsumed to the immediate process of production; an emphasis 
  on the wage struggle as a key terrain of political conflict; and the insistence 
  that the working class was the driving force within capitalist society.<A NAME="[3]" HREF="#[3]B">[3]</A> 
  All these features were a reaction against, and the basis for a developed alternative 
  to, the productivist reformism and (bourgeois) politics of the traditional (Stalinist) 
  left, i.e. the PCI (the Italian Communist Party, by far the largest Communist 
  Party in Western Europe). For the PCI, 'politics' was conducted primarily through 
  parliament (and the union bureaucracy). By contrast, in stressing the significance 
  of workers' own struggles within industries, the workerists rejected the classical 
  Leninist distinction between 'political' and 'economic' struggles.
<P>Through relating workerist theory to the context of the struggles through which 
  it emerged, <I>Storming Heaven</I> examines workerism's most well-known category 
  - that of <I>class composition</I>, which Wright (p. 49) defines as the various 
  behaviours which arise when particular forms of labour-power are inserted in 
  specific processes of production. <I>operaismo</I> also introduced the concept 
  of the <I>mass worker</I>, which describes the subject identified through the 
  research on the FIAT and Olivetti factories. What characterizes the mass worker 
  is its relatively simple labour; its place at heart of immediate process of 
  production; and its lack of the bonds which had tied skilled workers to production 
  (Wright, p. 107).
<P><B>1.2. Workerism beyond workers</B><BR>
  As Cleaver points out, the traditional Marxian analysis, and political practice, 
  understands production and work itself as neutral. The aim is to take over the 
  means of production, and run them 'in the interests of the workers', to the 
  ends of a fairer distribution. However, the research on FIAT and Olivetti had 
  shown that the division of labour, and the definition of skills, operated as 
  a process of domination rather than being a technical matter. The workerists 
  therefore proposed concepts intended to grasp this non-neutrality of factory 
  organization and machinery. Particularly important here is the work of Panzieri, 
  who had argued that, unlike the reformist Stalinists, the working class recognized 
  the unity of the 'technical' and 'despotic' moments of the organization of production.<A NAME="[4]" HREF="#[4]B">[4]</A> 
  Such concepts pointed to the limitations of workers' self-management which could 
  be seen to be merely the self-management of one's own domination.
<P>Tronti developed this line of analysis with the notion of the <I>social factory</I>. 
  The idea of the factory as locus of power was extended to the wider society 
  as a whole which was seen to be organized around the same principles of domination 
  and value (re)production.<A NAME="[5]" HREF="#[5]B">[5]</A> The implication 
  of this was that, since social organization in society is not neutral, then 
  resistance outside the factory could be a valid moment of the class struggle.
<P>Yet the emphasis on those (factory) workers in the immediate process of production 
  meant that <I>operaismo</I> was caught in a tension if not a contradiction. 
  Tronti and others were unable to reconcile their notion of the social factory 
  with the emphasis they wanted to place on what happened in large factories: 
  even as they pointed beyond the mass worker, workerists continued to privilege 
  the role of the factory proletariat.
<P><I>Autonomia</I> (the 'area of autonomy'), a loose network of groupings including 
  and influenced by radical workerists, emerged in the 1970s, following the collapse 
  of some of the workerist groups. This new movement also saw the influx of a 
  lot of younger people; they were often university educated or working in small 
  manufacturing or the service sector. They characteristically emphasized the 
  localized and personal over class-wide struggle, need over duty, and difference 
  over homogeneity (Wright, p. 197). They thus sought to stretch the concept of 
  class composition beyond the immediate labour-process in the factories. They 
  were also less committed to totalizing concepts of class and to their workplace 
  identities; and they had less time for the PCI and the unions. Some of these 
  tendencies found theoretical expression in Bologna's seminal 'The Tribe of Moles'.<A NAME="[6]" HREF="#[6]B">[6]</A>
<P>The most controversial theoretical development in this period was Toni Negri's 
  argument that the mass worker had been replaced by what he called the <I>socialized 
  worker</I> (<I>operaio sociale</I>). Negri's thesis was that capital, while 
  maintaining the firm as the heart of its valorization process, drives toward 
  a greater socialization of labour, going beyond the simple extension of the 
  immediate process of production towards a complete redefinition of the category 
  of productive labour. The extent of this category, according to Negri, was now 
  "relative to the level of the advancement of the process of subsumption of labour 
  to capital… [W]e can now say that the concept of wage labourer and the concept 
  of productive labourer tend towards homogeneity", with the resulting constitution 
  of "the new social figure of a unified proletariat".<A NAME="[7]" HREF="#[7]B">[7]</A> 
  In short, all moments of the circulation process, and even reproduction, were 
  seen to be productive of value; the distinction between productive and non-productive 
  labour was obliterated. While <I>Capital</I>, volume 1, assumes the reproduction 
  of labour-power in the form of the family and education, Negri's theoretical 
  innovation was to focus on this as a locus of struggle. Negri suggested that, 
  historically, there had been a shift in emphasis after the end of the 1960s 
  whereby capital adopted a strategy to avoid exclusive dependence on the traditional 
  working class and to rely more heavily on the labour-power of social groups 
  who were, at that time, marginal and less organized.<A NAME="[8]" HREF="#[8]B">[8]</A> 
  Thus he and his followers looked to the organized unemployed, the women's movement, 
  the practice of self-reduction and the increasing instances of organized looting 
  that characterised the Movement of 1977 as valid moments of anti-capitalist 
  practice; the revolutionary process was understood as a pluralism of organs 
  of proletarian self-rule (Wright, p. 173). As Wright discusses, Negri's account 
  was criticized as ultimately too abstract because it identified power as the 
  dimension linking all the social groups and practices referred to as constituting 
  the socialized worker; this emphasis had the effect of flattening out differences 
  between the different groups and practices. The redefinition of the category 
  of productive labour is problematic for the same reason. Moreover, it led Negri 
  to draw over-optimistic conclusions as to the class composition resulting from 
  the real subsumption of labour to capital. The 'socialized worker' also seemed 
  to change over time. At first, the socialized worker characteristically referred 
  to precarious workers; later, as Negri's perspective wavered with his disconnection 
  from the movement, it was embodied in the 'immaterial worker', as exemplified 
  by the computer programmer.<A NAME="[9]" HREF="#[9]B">[9]</A>
<P>The area of autonomy reached its zenith with the Movement of 1977. However, 
  it wasn't just the well-documented massive state repression, in the form of 
  violence and imprisonment, that led to the breaking of <I>autonomia</I> and 
  the collapse of workerism. The development of <I>autonomia</I> and the emphasis 
  on extra-workplace struggles went hand in hand with the isolation of the radical 
  workerists from the wider working class. It was this isolation and hence pessimism 
  in the possibility of a wider movement that led many ultimately to end up back 
  in the PCI - or to join the armed groups.
<P><B>1.3 Cleaver's account of the working class</B><BR>
  One problem often raised against the communist project is that of the supposed 
  disappearance of its agent - the working class. Marx's conception of revolution 
  is said to be linked with a class structure that was disappearing. This was 
  a particularly pressing issue at the time Cleaver originally wrote <I>Reading 
  'Capital' Politically</I>, with Gorz's <I>Farewell to the Working Class</I> 
  and similar sociological analyses becoming fashionable. Cleaver offers a response 
  to this by suggesting that the working class is just changing shape and is in 
  fact everywhere.<A NAME="[10]" HREF="#[10]B">[10]</A> For many of us, the most 
  influential aspect of Harry Cleaver's <I>Reading 'Capital' Politically</I> is 
  less his 'political' account of the relation between value and struggles (which 
  we discuss below) than his Introduction, in which a history of movements and 
  ideas is used to develop an 'autonomist' conceptualization of the working class 
  in opposition to that of traditional Marxism as well as to those who wanted 
  to argue that the working class was disappearing. (In fact, while Cleaver's 
  book was photocopied and passed around by loads of people, most people we know 
  only read the Introduction!)
<P>Cleaver's class analysis can be seen to follow on from Tronti's concept of 
  the social factory and Bologna's 'The Tribe of Moles'. Thus, in his account 
  of developments in Italy, he suggests that the struggles of non-factory workers 
  - predominantly women in this case - both embodied and clarified the new class 
  composition (p. 71). 'Community' struggles around the self-reduction of rents 
  and food and utility prices, he suggests, enabled these women participants to 
  become more conscious of their own role in value-production. Hence their own 
  autonomous activity could be grasped as an essential part of the class struggle, 
  rather than being limited to the auxiliary role of supporting the wage-based 
  struggles of their menfolk. Cleaver takes the Wages for Housework campaign as 
  the highest expression of this development.
<P>In the new preface to <I>Reading 'Capital' Politically</I>, Cleaver (pp. 16-17) 
  elaborates on this account of the nature of class. Descriptively, an essential 
  point here is the extension of the category of the working class to cover not 
  only the waged but also the unwaged. Cleaver claims that this expanded definition 
  is justified by historical research (e.g. Linebaugh's <I>The London Hanged</I><A NAME="[11]" HREF="#[11]B">[11]</A>) 
  which, it is suggested, shows in the political culture of artisans and others 
  that the working class predates the predominance of the wage. Conceptually, 
  the crux of Cleaver's argument is in terms of a social group's exploitation 
  by, and hence struggles against, capital. Moreover, the struggles of the social 
  group as such, rather than their subsumption within a general working class 
  struggle, are taken to be significant for their self-transformative potential. 
  For Cleaver, the ability of such social groups to re-create themselves in struggle 
  points to a problem with traditional (narrow) definitions of the working class, 
  which said nothing about this self-re-creation.<A NAME="[12]" HREF="#[12]B">[12]</A> 
  In line with the tradition of <I>autonomia</I>, Cleaver's account recognizes 
  resistance to capital as an inherent feature of the majority of humanity, rather 
  than - as in sociological and some Marxist accounts of Western class structure 
  - limited to the industrial proletariat.
<P>Cleaver's account of an 'autonomist' tradition of struggles and theories was 
  important for us, as for many people seeking an adequate account of class struggle 
  in the 1980s and '90s. But, re-reading Cleaver's definition of the working class 
  now, and in particular the social groups he seeks to include (as social groups) 
  within this definition, leads us to argue that his account is not sufficient 
  as a class analysis. The question is whether exploitation is a feature of the 
  social group he refers to as such, and therefore whether resistance is inherent 
  for the group as such. Our argument is that there are differences and distinctions 
  that matter within and between the social categories that Cleaver identifies 
  as part of the working class. Wright argues that <I>operaismo</I> and <I>autonomia</I> 
  employ concepts which serve to flatten out and lose important differences and 
  distinctions in class analysis. Our point is that Cleaver is heir to this tendency.
<P>To flesh this argument out, let us consider each of the social categories that 
  Cleaver wants to (re-)define as part of the working class.
<P>Before doing so, however, we need to stress here the inadequacy of playing the game of treating classes as categories into which we place people. For us, class is not a form of stratification but a <I>social relation</I>; rather than attempting to classify people we need to understand how class is formed, as a process, within a relationship of antagonism.<A NAME="[13]" HREF="#[13]B">[13]</A>  It is true that individuals are situated differently with regards the fundamental social relation of how labour is pumped out of the direct producers (and that identities and perceptions of interests linked with these identities can form around these situations). But our argument with Cleaver's (re)classifications is inadequate in its own right, and needs to be read within a broader argument about class as a relation not (just) a stratum.<P>

Cleaver states (p. 73): 

<BLOCKQUOTE>The identification of the leading role of the unwaged in the struggles of the 1960s in Italy, and the extension of the concept [of working class political recomposition] to the peasantry, provided a theoretical framework within which the struggles of American and European students and housewives, the unemployed, ethnic and racial minorities, and Third World [sic] peasants could all be grasped as moments of an international cycle of working class struggle. </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><I><strong>The unemployed</strong></I><BR>
  Organized unemployed struggles played a significant role in the Italian experience 
  of the '70s - the Neapolitan movement for example was able to mobilize thousands 
  of unemployed workers, becoming the region's central reference point for militant 
  activity (Wright, p. 165). In these pages and in other publications, we have 
  given much attention to such struggles, which for us are often over benefits, 
  for the very simple reason that benefits are the other side of the coin of the 
  working wage<A NAME="[14]" HREF="#[14]B">[14]</A> (and because we ourselves 
  have relied on benefits so much!). The unemployed are the lowest stratum of 
  the proletariat - the most dispossessed - and are likely to have a background 
  in the working class as such. In <I>Capital</I>, volume 1, Marx demonstrates 
  that the unemployed are necessary to value-production. Since they are defined 
  as a category by their relationship to the wage, the unemployed are obviously 
  part of the working class. But Marx also makes clear how the unemployed function 
  to instil discipline in those in work and hence put "a curb on their pretensions".<A NAME="[15]" HREF="#[15]B">[15]</A> 
  For traditional Marxism, the unemployed as such cannot play the same role as 
  the industrial working class; they lack both the leverage and the potential 
  for revolutionary class consciousness of those in work. In this perspective, 
  unemployed struggles must necessarily be reduced to the role of tail-ending 
  workers' strikes; any unemployed 'autonomy' could too easily take the form of 
  scabbing.<A NAME="[16]" HREF="#[16]B">[16]</A>
<P> However, the functions of a social stratum for capital do not necessarily 
  define the limits of the subjectivity associated with it. Historically, it has 
  often been the least self-organized, or the least autonomous, among the unemployed 
  who have scabbed. The unemployed are, among those Cleaver cites, the social 
  group which can least controversially be defined as part of the working class.
<P><I><strong>'Race'</strong></I><BR>
  In the case of 'race' and ethnicity, what is being referred to here by Cleaver 
  is the construction by capital of divisions within the working class in order 
  to create and justify competition amongst workers. To the extent that 'racial' 
  and ethnic identities are constructed, working class organization itself is 
  'racialized' or 'ethnicized'. In other words, it is because racialization and 
  ethnicity is part of way that class division is constructed and the working 
  class decomposed that people might use 'racial' and ethnic identities as a basis 
  for organizing against capital. Blacks and those other ethnic minorities who 
  organize and resist autonomously do so because they, as a social stratum, experience 
  class more harshly, and are more often located at the proletarian pole of the 
  class relation; and this is because of the way 'blackness' and 'whiteness' have 
  been socially constructed (in the USA). Those ethnic minorities which do not 
  engage in such autonomous action tend to be those that are more socially mobile; 
  i.e. in US terms they become 'white'.
<P>Particularly in the USA,<A NAME="[17]" HREF="#[17]B">[17]</A> blacks are atypical 
  of ethnic and 'racial' groups: always at the bottom of the pile, even in relation 
  to other ethnic minorities. Blacks are the prototype of the working class; and 
  the black middle class is the exception that proves the rule.
<P><I><strong>Women</strong></I><BR>
  The emergence of women as collective subjects of social change contributed to 
  a reassessment of <I>operaismo</I>'s class analysis (Wright, p. 133). In particular, 
  women's demands for a universal social wage were seen to point to a solution 
  to the limits of the over-emphasis on the working wage (Wright, pp. 123, 135). 
  Some in <I>autonomia</I>, such as the Rosso group, began to talk of the emergence 
  of a 'new female proletariat'; for them, along with the unemployed, feminists 
  were seen as integral components of the new social subject - the 'socialized 
  worker'.
<P>Likewise, for Cleaver, women are a key example of a social category that, through 
  their struggles, should be grasped as part of the working class - in particular 
  'housewives' demanding wages for their work of reproducing labour-power.<A NAME="[18]" HREF="#[18]B">[18]</A> 
  From our perspective, it is clear that it is working class women - defined here 
  in terms of the class position of their family - who are more likely to be involved 
  in such struggles. Better-off women are less likely to need and want the 'transitional 
  demand' of a wage, and can achieve 'autonomy' individually (through pursuing 
  a career) rather than needing to organize collectively. Moreover, the form through 
  which women have challenged exploitative gender relations has varied historically. 
  The identification and questioning of women's roles that emerged in the 1960s 
  was part of a theorization and challenge to the reproduction of capitalist society 
  more broadly, and hence tended to be expressed as a movement of social change. 
  But, particularly since the retreat of the wider class struggle, feminism has 
  instead tended to be an ideology justifying either a reduction of the political 
  to the personal (with no link to social transformation) or a vehicle for middle 
  class women's careerism. Without being grounded in - rather than trying to form 
  the basis of - a class analysis, the emphasis of the struggles of women as women 
  inevitably risks this dead-end.
<P><I><strong>Peasants</strong></I><BR>
  Cleaver's inclusion of peasant struggles as part of the working class differentiates 
  him from statements in classical workerism. Although the early workerists recognised 
  that peasant struggles could contribute to working class internationalism, they 
  also suggested that the two should not be confused, and that the 'salvation' 
  of peasants ultimately lay with their counterparts in the more developed parts 
  of the world (Wright, p. 66).
<P>To state that peasant struggles are in effect working class struggles at least 
  serves to convey something about the social location of the peasant in a capitalist 
  world and the consequences of their actions for the broader class struggle. 
  Despite not depending exclusively upon a wage, peasants' work is often commodified; 
  the way they produce goods is subject to the demands of the world market. Hence 
  some peasants' attempts in some sense to act like 'the working class' - i.e., 
  collectively to resist capital's requirements.
<P>But Cleaver's redefinition of 'peasants' as part of the wider working class 
  glosses significant differences within this heterogeneous social category. The 
  term 'peasant' covers a multitude of economic positions: there are varying degrees 
  of communal relations, varying degrees of production for the market (versus 
  for subsistence), varying extents to which some are moving towards the capitalist 
  class, and varying degrees to which peasants engage in wage labour. It is for 
  this reason that 'peasants' as such do not act like and therefore cannot simply 
  be lumped in with a broad working class.
<P> Even if we take it that Cleaver simply means the majority of peasants who 
  have no chance of becoming capitalist farmers, there is nevertheless a logic 
  to their struggles which characteristically prevents them from constituting 
  themselves as the negation of capital. The peasant is defined by a relationship 
  to the land, and land is characteristically the issue over which peasants struggle. 
  Given this, the successes of peasant struggles are also their limits. In the 
  case of the wage, a quantitative success (more money) preserves the qualitative 
  relationship of alienation but can point to its supersession: victory is still 
  unsatisfactory but any setback for the capitalist class may suggest the vulnerability 
  of the capital relation itself. But a victory in a struggle over land is an 
  end in itself which thereby impels no higher level of struggle. There is no 
  essential imperative in land struggles to abolish land ownership itself. As 
  we argued in a previous issue of <I>Aufheben</I>, while we might acknowledge 
  the revolutionary subjectivity of peasant-based struggles such as that of the 
  Chiapas Indians, the peasant condition entails a conservative stability in social 
  relations. Peasant resistance tends to reflect external threat rather than internal 
  class antagonism. Consequently, the form of that resistance may often entail 
  alliances between small private farmers and those who depend on communal landholdings 
  - or even between a peasant mass and a leftist-nationalist and urban-based leadership.<A NAME="[19]" HREF="#[19]B">[19]</A> 
  Thus, we do not see the resolution of 'the agrarian (i.e., peasant) problem' 
  simply in 'autonomous' peasant struggles, nor, obviously, in the proletarianization 
  of the peasantry; rather, with Marx<A NAME="[20]" HREF="#[20]B">[20]</A> (and 
  Camatte),<A NAME="[21]" HREF="#[21]B">[21]</A> we might look to a revolution 
  in which peasant communal possibilities are aided by a wider proletarian uprising 
  at the heart of capitalist power.
<P><I><strong>Students</strong></I><BR>
  For workerist groups such as <I>Potere Operaio</I> (Workers' Power), student 
  struggles had to be subordinated to those of factory workers. But student movements 
  were a part of both the Hot Autumn of 1969 and the Movement of 1977, and were 
  important for workerism's attempt to theorize the proletarianization of intellectual 
  labour.<A NAME="[22]" HREF="#[22]B">[22]</A> One of the interesting developments 
  of the Hot Autumn was the appropriation of a faculty building at the Turin Medical 
  College for the purpose of a permanent general assembly.<A NAME="[23]" HREF="#[23]B">[23]</A> 
  The 1977 Movement involved practical attempts to link workers and students both 
  organizationally and in terms of demands such as the generalized wage, which 
  was seen as a way of enabling more working class young people access to university.
<P>Cleaver's categorization of students as part of the working class might be 
  seen as somewhat prescient since the gulf between university students and others 
  in the labour market has narrowed in recent years. As more students gain degrees, 
  so the value of the degree decreases and the jobs that graduates go into may 
  often be no more privileged or well-paid than those of their more basically-educated 
  counterparts. Graduate unemployment is higher now than ever.
<P> However, these are only tendencies. Students are overwhelmingly middle class 
  in terms of their family background (income, values and expectations) and their 
  destinations. In line with the notion of the social factory, Cleaver deals with 
  such considerations by defining students' education as work to reproduce the 
  commodity of labour-power.<A NAME="[24]" HREF="#[24]B">[24]</A> But their work 
  as students is more than, and different from, the simple reproduction of just 
  any labour-power. In the first place, the end product of the work of the university 
  student isn't necessarily skills at all but rather a qualification, the point 
  of which is just to provide access to more privileged occupations. What is being 
  reproduced, therefore, is hierarchy within the workforce - a division of labour 
  to enhance competition. This process is also ideological to the extent that 
  its beneficiaries internalize and identify with the resultant hierarchical division 
  - believing that they deserve their privilege, and that only a talented and 
  hard-working minority can achieve their kind of status. Second, the 'skills' 
  that are reproduced through university education are not only those of supervision 
  and management, but also (for those graduating in the humanities and social 
  sciences) those of classifying, bullshitting and playing a role - all of which 
  don't make sense outside of alienated social relations.
<P>In focusing on autonomy and its possible consequences for capital, Cleaver's 
  redefinition of student struggles as working class therefore loses some important 
  features of this social category.<A NAME="[25]" HREF="#[25]B">[25]</A> It is 
  an overly cynical point of view, perhaps, to state that 'student radicals' mostly 
  end up pursuing the same well-paid establishment careers as their parents; but 
  the moment of truth in such a claim lies in the fact that there is no equivalent 
  expectation for young working class radicals mostly to end up becoming managers! 
  Unlike students, the young working class (in working class jobs) don't usually 
  have the same choice.
<P><I><strong>Whatever happened to the middle class?</strong></I><BR>
  The 'middle class' is a label largely absent from <I>Reading 'Capital' Politically</I>, 
  which is because for Cleaver it largely doesn't exist, except perhaps sociologically. 
  The 'autonomist Marxist' argument seems to be that, in conditions of the 'social 
  factory', the middle classes are just a sector of the working class.
<P> On the one hand, Cleaver's analysis again reflects real tendencies. In a number 
  of domains, middle class work has been de-skilled and proletarianized. Casualization, 
  once limited only to working class jobs, has now come to many in the middle 
  classes. Moreover, many salaries, particularly in the public sector, have increasingly 
  lost value over the past 20 years or so. At the same time, the salaries of those 
  at the top end of the middle classes, and particularly in the private sector 
  (e.g., accountants, lawyers and the various types of 'consultant'), have continued 
  to rise. Hence, as a shared identity assumed by people whose conditions vary 
  widely - from white-collar workers in insecure jobs with salaries lower than 
  their blue-collar counterparts, to executives and senior managers - the 'middle 
  class' as a whole is to say the least a problematic category if not a mystification. 
  In the USA, Cleaver's home country, the term is even more problematic due to 
  the (self)description of large sections of the (white) working class as 'middle 
  class'.
<P> On the other hand, to take these disjunctions, anomalies and tendencies to 
  mean that the category 'middle class' can be dispensed with is one-sided. The 
  analytic subsumption of most of the middle classes within the working class 
  is one-sided because it loses the explanatory power of the middle class as a 
  category.
<P>Here again, we would argue, Cleaver's analysis reflects the limits of the approach 
  he is heir to. As Wright argues, for all its vital contributions to our understanding 
  of struggle, one of the problems with <I>autonomia</I> and <I>operaismo</I> 
  more broadly is the way it misrepresents one tendency as standing for the totality. 
  In the same way, Cleaver misrepresents a particular tendency as a characteristic 
  of the class situation as a whole.
<P> While tendencies to proletarianization might push many of the middle classes 
  toward throwing in their lot with the working class, there are other features 
  of the middle class condition as such which operate in the other direction. 
  What is absent from Cleaver's class analysis is an acknowledgement of the ties 
  that bind the middle class individual to his role or class position and hence 
  to the alienated world that gives rise to that role and class position.
<P> One feature which distinguishes the middle class from the working class, and 
  which has consequences for the possibility of revolutionary practice and subjectivity, 
  is the presence or absence of a career structure. While wages in working class 
  occupations typically rise to a relatively early peak and then plateau off, 
  middle class salaries more typically develop in continual increments within 
  which the middle class individual can foresee a future of continually rising 
  income and enhanced status. In effect, the longer she carries on and sticks 
  to the job, the relatively less interest the middle class individual has in 
  escaping since the greater comfort the job provides him or her. Because the 
  working class job typically provides no such prospect, the imperative to escape 
  remains a lifespan constant.
<P> Second, while pride in one's role can arise in many types of occupation, middle 
  class jobs often engender an identification of a type which is characteristically 
  absent in the case of working class jobs. Such middle class identification has 
  consequences for the form taken by resistance - and for whether resistance takes 
  place at all. The academic, social worker, lawyer etc. may wish to attack capital 
  but they characteristically do so by premising their resistance on the continued 
  existence of their own role in a way unthinkable to the working class individual. 
  Thus there are radical psychologists, radical philosophers, radical lawyers 
  and so on,<A NAME="[26]" HREF="#[26]B">[26]</A> but not radical bricklayers 
  or radical roadsweepers! The latter are simply radical <I>people</I> who wish 
  to escape their condition. By contrast, the former wish to engage in the struggle 
  while at the same time retaining their middle class identities, including their 
  specialized skills and roles. As such, their participation presupposes rather 
  than fundamentally challenges the institutions and social relations that provide 
  the basis of these identities.<A NAME="[27]" HREF="#[27]B">[27]</A> It is no 
  coincidence, it seems to us, that the leading figures of a post-<I>autonomia</I> 
  scene which rejects (or at least neglects) the situationists' critique of roles 
  and academia, and which redefines all areas of life - including academia - as 
  working class, are themselves academics.<A NAME="[28]" HREF="#[28]B">[28]</A>
<P> Some groups, such as the professionals - doctors, lawyers, academics - who 
  retain control of entry into their profession, should obviously be defined as 
  middle class. But there are other groups for which the situation is less clear-cut. 
  For the most part dealing with the thorny issue of class, and in particular 
  the status of the middle classes, is inevitable messy. This is because class 
  is a <I>process</I> not a box into which we can simply categorize people, as 
  in sociology.<A NAME="[29]" HREF="#[29]B">[29]</A> In Argentina, for example, 
  we are seeing a process where middle class identity breaks down; but to understand 
  this it is necessary to recognise that such an identity exists and has a material 
  basis. As we see it, the problem with the way Cleaver flattens out everything 
  into the working class is precisely the absence of class composition and decomposition 
  as a process. Class (composition) involves a constant dynamic of proletarianization 
  and 'embourgeoisment'. But if these poles are not recognized - and if the middle 
  classes are understood as already working class - class composition appears 
  only as a static given.
<P><B>1.4 Autonomy as basis or function of working class composition?</B><BR>
  As we have seen, Cleaver's fundamental point is that the unwaged, and hence 
  the other social categories he refers to, are part of the working class only 
  insofar as capital has sought to exploit and alienate their unwaged labour or 
  particular condition, and since these unwaged and other categories are now fighting 
  back against capital. It is their <I>struggle</I> not their social category 
  membership as such that makes them part of the working class. Thus the key for 
  Cleaver is autonomous action against capital.
<P>As such, Cleaver is again consistent with the tradition that has come out of 
  workerism, which sought to distinguish itself and go beyond the poverty of traditional 
  Marxism through focusing on precisely the independent or autonomous activity 
  of workers in struggle; their collective activity and organization of resistance 
  was shown to occur without the mediation of the party or union - or even in 
  opposition to them. Antagonism itself, in the form of autonomy, was thus the 
  basis of class analysis.
<P>In the sixties, the workerists subsumed the specificity of different working 
  class locations and experiences to those of the mass worker. In the seventies, 
  Negri's work threatened to dissolve even this partially concrete understanding 
  of class into a generic proletariat, the 'socialized worker'. Bologna in 'The 
  tribe of moles' identified new subjective determinations of class: "Classes 
  have tended to lose their 'objective' characteristics and become defined in 
  terms of political subjectivity".<A NAME="[30]" HREF="#[30]B">[30]</A> For Bologna, 
  questions of social and cultural identity, of acceptance or refusal to accept 
  the norms of social behaviour required by the state, now played a role in the 
  reproduction of classes. These new determinants were said to be evidenced in 
  "the continuous reproduction and invention of systems of counter-culture and 
  struggle in the sphere of everyday living, which has become ever more illegal".
<P>In fact, Negri and others abandoned the central investigative approach of the 
  workerists - that of examining the relationship between 'material conditions 
  of exploitation' and 'political behaviours'. As Wright discusses, the radical 
  workerists overemphasized the subjective, the "will of destruction" (<I>Potere 
  Operaio</I>, 1972, cited in Wright, p. 138), as judged, post festum, from an 
  analysis of the struggle rather than location in the labour process. The abandonment 
  of the material determinants of class composition leaves unresolved the question 
  of how the different subjects, or strata of the class, recognize themselves 
  and each other as proletariat, the universal revolutionary class.
<P>For us, the reason why different groups organize autonomously against capital is because they are already proletarian (or, at least, being proletarianized). Antagonism arises because of class. It is implicit in our arguments above in relation to the different social categories referred to by Cleaver that the possibility of 'autonomy' may be necessary but it is not sufficient for a class analysis. 'Autonomy' requires, and therefore cannot be the basis of, a proper class analysis: the subjective requires the objective.
<P class=subtitle>2. Beyond leftism?<A NAME="[31]" HREF="#[31]B">[31]</A></P>

<P>It was a vital insight of workerism to see workers' refusal to participate 
  in union-sponsored token strikes not as the absence of class conflict but as 
  evidence of their autonomy. In debates today about the state of the class struggle, 
  the danger is to take such 'passivity' as just a refusal of representation when 
  it might in fact be doubled-edged: at the same time as being an expression of 
  hostility to capital it might also entail a paralysing fatalism. However, a 
  weakness of workerism was not an exaggerated sense of the significance of workers' 
  autonomous antagonism not only to capital but to the institutional left; rather 
  it was an unwillingness or inability to reconcile their insights with their 
  conceptions of organization. Time and again, the same theorists who provided 
  us with the theoretical tools for a new approach caution us to be modest in 
  our understandings of workers' struggles. For example, Panzieri stressed that 
  sabotage merely expressed workers' political defeat (Wright, p. 61); and <I>Classe 
  Operaia</I> ('Working Class') suggested that spontaneous struggles were not 
  enough (Wright, p. 69). While we agree that different particular struggles need 
  to be linked up if they are to go beyond themselves, there is a crucial question 
  of the nature of this organization and how it may arise. For the most part, 
  the workerists tended to fetishize formal organizational structure in a way 
  which reflected their Leninist origins.
<P>In the first place, there was for a long time an unwillingness to cut the ties 
  to the PCI. Thus, Tronti continued to argue for the necessity of working within 
  the PCI in order to 'save' it from reformism. Tronti was not typical and ultimately 
  abandoned workerism; but <I>Potere Operaio</I> too maintained links with the 
  PCI until the events of France 1968, and even then still saw itself as Leninist. 
  And Negri, despite having written about the contradiction within <I>autonomia</I> 
  between those who privileged 'the movement' and the champions of a 'Leninist' 
  conception of organization, affirmed his commitment to the necessity of the 
  Leninist Party even during the events of 1977 (Wright, p. 214).
<P>In part, <I>autonomia</I> emerged as a grouping of militants who felt the need 
  to criticize Leninist forms of organization and practice (including the formal 
  party structure), placing emphasis instead on class needs: "To articulate such 
  needs, organization was to be rooted directly in factories and neighbourhoods, 
  in bodies capable both of promoting struggles managed directly by the class 
  itself, and of restoring to the latter that 'awareness of proletarian power 
  which the traditional organisations have destroyed'" (<I>Comitati Autonomi Operai</I>, 
  1976, cited in Wright p. 153). Ultimately, however, as Bologna argued, <I>autonomia</I> 
  failed in this regard, reverting to a vanguardism which forgot that "organisation 
  is obliged to measure itself day by day against the new composition of the class; 
  and must find its political programme only in the behaviour of the class and 
  not in some set of statutes."<A NAME="[32]" HREF="#[32]B">[32]</A>
<P>Despite their attempt to escape the 'political', the workerists themselves 
  were in fact caught up in a politicism, in that they both constantly tried to 
  express the social movement's needs in terms of unifying <I>political</I> demands 
  and were forever trying to reinvent the party. Although they innovated in some 
  ways, with ideas like the armed party, their conception of organization remained 
  Leninist in its fetishism of formal organizational structure, and showed little 
  sense of Marx's quite different conception of the (historical) party.<A NAME="[33]" HREF="#[33]B">[33]</A> 
  As such, a proper critique of the left and of leftism was still not developed. 
  This problem is reproduced in current versions of the workerist approach.
<P>Our argument is that, if the concept of autonomy is insufficient for a class analysis, it is also inadequate - in the sense of being too open or ambiguous - for a critique of leftism. Whose 'autonomous struggle' is it? The emphasis on autonomy itself, and the consequent absence of an adequate critique of the left, has meant that some of the inheritors of the tradition are uncritical of nationalism.<A NAME="[34]" HREF="#[34]B">[34]</A>  <P>

<P>Cleaver (p. 25) states "The [Vietnam] antiwar movement joined many of these 
  diverse struggles, and its linkage with the peasants of Southeast Asia became 
  complete with the slogan of 'Victory to the NLF [National Liberation Front]' 
  and with the flying of Vietcong flags from occupied campus buildings." In relation 
  to this, the idea of 'circulation of struggles', which refers to how struggle 
  in one area inspires that in another, certainly described something of the social 
  movements of the '60s and '70s (though we'd also have to acknowledge the reverse 
  process whereby defeat of one section after another discouraged the rest). But 
  such a concept is inadequate in itself if it means, for example, that the struggles 
  of the Vietnamese peasants are considered without referring to the nationalist 
  and Stalinist frame in which they took place, and if it means treating uncritically 
  the way that an anti-imperialist ideology dominated the minds of the students 
  (i.e. they tended to see the western proletariat as irretrievably 'bought off' 
  and themselves as a front for the 'Third World').<A NAME="[35]" HREF="#[35]B">[35]</A> 
  Harry Cleaver's 'autonomist Marxist' treatment of leftists and nationalists 
  is reflected currently in his uncritical attitude to the Zapatistas.<A NAME="[36]" HREF="#[36]B">[36]</A> 
  In Cleaver's texts there isn't a proper critique of the role of leftism and 
  nationalism in struggles because such expressions are considered - equally with 
  the struggles of 'housewives', students, the unemployed and the industrial proletariat 
  - moments of autonomy to the extent that they appear to challenge the capitalist 
  strategy of imposing work within particular national and international frameworks. 
  Any criticism of nationalism in struggles, as in the case of Zapatistas, is 
  dismissed by him as ideological or dogmatic.
<P>Given their necessary antipathy to the project of the negation of capital, 
  the 'autonomy' of leftist and nationalist tendencies must mean their subsumption 
  and indeed crushing of proletarian autonomy! This analytic gap, through which 
  the forces inherently opposed to working class self-organization can emerge 
  as <I>equivalents</I> to that working class self-organization, appears to be 
  a function of the failure of the <I>autonomia</I> tendency to make quite the 
  radical break from Leninism which is sometimes claimed for it, and which Cleaver 
  has inherited (despite the fact that, unlike Negri, he has never endorsed any 
  party). At its worst, far from being an alternative to a leftism in which political 
  representation and nationalism are supported as vehicles of 'revolution', 'autonomist 
  Marxism' can end up being just another variety of such uncritical leftism. While 
  they may reject the idea of the formal party, the 'autonomists' still seek to 
  formulate political demands for autonomous struggles in a similar way to the 
  leftists.<BR>
<p class=subtitle>3. Negotiating the 'law of value'</P>

<P>A further workerist tension reproduced in Cleaver's book is that surrounding 
  the status of the 'law of value'. On the one hand, the very emphasis on workers 
  at the sharp end of the immediate process of production appears to speak of 
  a commitment to the centrality of value-production in the explanation of the 
  dynamic of class struggle. On the other hand, the seeds of a revisionist approach 
  were sewn as early as 1970, when <I>Potere Operaio</I> argued that class struggle 
  had broken free of the bounds of accumulation; the mass worker was said to have 
  disrupted the functioning of the law of value, forcing capital to rely more 
  and more on the state (p. 137). <I>Potere Operaio</I> cited the Hot Autumn as 
  the turning point, but their analysis was prompted by a revolt in the second 
  half of 1970 among the population of Reggio Calabria against proposed changes 
  to the city's regional status which seemed to speak of a widespread violent 
  rejection of the institutions. This line of reasoning was developed by Negri, 
  who was led by his understanding of the crisis as a product of class antagonism 
  to argue that the law of value was being superseded by relations of direct political 
  confrontation between classes,<A NAME="[37]" HREF="#[37]B">[37]</A> and that 
  money now needed to be understood in terms of its function as 'command'.<A NAME="[38]" HREF="#[38]B">[38]</A> 
  Subsequent to this, a distinctive feature of those influenced by the <I>autonomia</I> 
  tradition is the stress on the class struggle as a struggle not in relation 
  to value but for control over work: imposing it or resisting it.
<P>A major thrust of the whole American 'autonomist' scene has been to argue not 
  to follow Negri too far. But it seems to us that Cleaver's attempt to both embrace 
  certain post-<I>autonomia</I> and 'heretical' ideas that go 'beyond Marx' while 
  at the same time claiming fidelity to <I>Capital</I> gives rise to ambiguities 
  in relation to this question of value.
<P>Thus, on the one hand, <I>Reading 'Capital' Politically</I> suggests, at least in a footnote, that control is always tied to value; and in the second edition of the book, against those ('autonomists') who forget, Cleaver re-iterates that the labour theory of value is the "indispensible core" of Marx's theory (p. 11). On the other hand, throughout <I>Reading 'Capital' Politically</I>, food and energy (Cleaver's main examples) appear essentially as means to struggle for control itself rather than value-producing sectors; and work appears as a means of control in its own right: 

<BLOCKQUOTE>the ultimate use-value of the work, which is the use-value of labour-power, is its role as the fundamental means of capitalist social control. For the capitalist to be able to impose work is to retain social control. But the use-value of labour-power for capital is also its ability to produce value and surplus-value. (p. 100) </BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The use of the word 'also' seems indicative of the relative weighting given 
  to control over value as an explanation for the dynamics of class struggle.
<P>We accept that, although capital essentially treats all use-values as arbitrary 
  sources for valorization, capital cannot be unconcerned with the particularities 
  of use-values. Thus Cleaver is right, for example, to point back to the moment 
  of primitive accumulation where capital creates the working class by driving 
  peasants off the land and thus their source of food. Moreover, with contemporary 
  features like the Common Agricultural Policy and similar measures in other countries, 
  it is true that the special use-value of food (and the political significance 
  of classes engaged in food production) has led to it being perhaps more subject 
  to strategic planning measures by capital-in-general in the form of the state 
  and supranational bodies.
<P>Retrospectively, however, it now appears to us that the politicization of the 
  prices of food and energy - their appearance as manipulated instruments of struggle 
  between self-conscious capitalist and working class subjects - was a particular 
  feature of the crisis conditions of the 1970s (e.g. the energy crisis and the 
  focus on inflation state intervention in bargaining between the working class 
  and capital). Cleaver, like others in the post-<I>autonomia</I> tradition, uses 
  these historically specific moments in the class struggle to make generic points. 
  In the present period, there has been a 'depoliticization' of these price issues 
  in conditions of low inflation; and the ideological model has been that 'there 
  is no alternative' to the 'globalized' market.
<P>As we have argued in these pages before, there is a problem with the abandonment 
  of the law of value by theorists identifying with <I>autonomia</I>.<A NAME="[39]" HREF="#[39]B">[39]</A> 
  On our reading of Marx, and our understanding of capital, capital as a whole 
  comes to constitute itself as such out of disparate and indeed conflicting elements. 
  The conceptualization of capital as a subject in conflict with the working class 
  subject, each with their distinctive strategies ('imposition of work' versus 
  'refusal of work'), which Cleaver ultimately shares with Negri,<A NAME="[40]" HREF="#[40]B">[40]</A> 
  if taken as more than a shorthand or metaphor, suggests an already-unified capital. 
  Capital as a subject can have a <I>strategy</I> only to the extent that there 
  is a (price-fixing) conspiracy among the different capitals or that one particular 
  capital (who? US capital? The World Bank?) agrees to act as capital-in-general 
  in the same way that a national government acts for the national capitalist 
  interest. Capital as a totality of course has its <I>interests</I>; but these 
  - all founded on the need to exploit the working class as hard as possible - 
  arise from and operate precisely through its conflicting elements: the competition 
  between individual capitals. Capital may attain more consciousness at times 
  of heightened class conflict, and this consciousness may become institutionalized. 
  But capital is not essentially a conscious subject.<BR>
<p class=subtitle>4. Grasping retreat</P>

<P>Tronti famously argued that each successful capitalist attack upon labour only 
  displaces class antagonism to a higher, more socialized level (Wright, p. 37). 
  Following this, Negri, Cleaver and others in and influenced by the <I>autonomia</I> 
  current stress the role of working class struggle in driving capital forward. 
  Working class activity is seen not (just) as a response to the initiatives of 
  capital but as the very motor of capitalist development - the prime mover.<A NAME="[41]" HREF="#[41]B">[41]</A> 
  In this account, capitalist crisis - the shutting down of industries, mass unemployment 
  and austerity - means that working class struggle simply changes form rather 
  than retreats. Class struggle is argued to be ubiquitous and manifold in form.
<P>	This perspective therefore offers a valuable corrective to traditional Marxism's objectivist account of the workings of capital. Traditional Marxism's frozen and fetishized conceptions of class struggle could lead one to wonder where resistance has gone and whether it will ever reappear. By contrast, 'autonomist Marxism' finds it everywhere. 
<P> However, we would suggest that workerism in general and Cleaver in particular 
  perhaps bend the stick too far the other way. In arguing that class struggle 
  is 'everywhere' and 'always', there is the explanatory problem of the evidence 
  of historical retreats in class struggle, as well as the 'political' problem 
  of responding to this retreat in practice. These problems are linked. 
<P><B>4.1 Confronting the evidence of decomposition</B><BR>
  In positing the 'unity of abstract labour' as the basis for the recomposition 
  of the class, Negri almost welcomed the 'disappearance' of the mass worker and 
  believed the defining moment of confrontation was approaching: "At the very 
  moment when 'the old contradiction' seemed to have subsided, and living labour 
  subsumed to capital, the entire force of insubordination coagulates in that 
  final front which is the antagonistic and general permanence of social labour".<A NAME="[42]" HREF="#[42]B">[42]</A> 
  At a time which could arguably be characterized as the beginning of capital's 
  counter-offensive of restructuring which resulted in a decomposition of the 
  class, he gave an account of a massive process of recomposition - a qualitative 
  leap in class unity. Wright (p. 167) concludes that this account did not match 
  up to Italian experience of the time. There appears little evidence of the concrete 
  unification between sectors upon which Negri's whole argument rested; the fierce 
  industrial struggles in the small factories of the North were cut off from other 
  sectors of the class. Wright suggests that, in 1975-6, it was proletarian youth 
  circles rather than the factory struggles that were making links across the 
  wider working class. The workers of the large factories were in a state of 'productive 
  truce' at best, rampant defeat at worst - and subordinate to the official labour 
  movement, which had regained control in the factories after the explosion of 
  autonomous struggles in 1969 and the years after. The unions' commitment to 
  tailor labour's demands to the requirements of accumulation was mirrored in 
  the political sphere by the PCI's 'historic compromise' with the ruling Christian 
  Democrats. The historic left, PCI and CGIL were committed to the 'management' 
  of the nation's economic difficulties.
<P> Bologna (1976, cited in Wright, pp. 170-1) accused Negri and <I>autonomia</I> 
  of "washing their hands of the mass worker's recent difficulties". He argued 
  that there had been a "reassertion of reformist hegemony over the factories, 
  one that is brutal and relentless in its efforts to dismember the class left". 
  Negri had failed to come to terms with the disarray and defeat of the mass worker 
  and preferred instead to "ply the traditional trade of the theorist in possession 
  of some grand synthesis". The <I>Comitati Autonomi Operai</I>, the Roman wing 
  of <I>autonomia</I>, also rejected Negri's optimistic vision, and criticized 
  his lack of an empirical basis for his abstractions, something which had been 
  so important to the earlier workerists.<A NAME="[43]" HREF="#[43]B">[43]</A>
<P>In the intervening quarter of a century, little has happened, it seems to us, 
  to bear out Negri's optimistic prognosis. The mass worker has been decomposed 
  through the flexibilization of labour, territorial disarticulation of production, 
  capital mobility in the world market, the rationalization of production, decentralization; 
  but the 'socialized worker' that has supposedly emerged from the ashes of the 
  mass worker has not been visible as a new universal proletariat capable of fundamentally 
  challenging the capital relation. Decomposition just is decomposition sometimes, 
  rather than necessarily being itself a recomposition.
<P>The 'autonomist Marxism' of Cleaver and those close to his perspective argues 
  that we need to acknowledge the validity of diverse and 'hidden' struggles (absenteeism, 
  theft at work, various forms of work to rule etc.) which are alive and well, 
  despite the decline of the older forms of overt collective resistance.<A NAME="[44]" HREF="#[44]B">[44]</A> 
  There is, of course, always resistance to the specific way in which surplus-labour 
  is pumped out of the direct producers. However, the fact that the working class 
  currently tends to resist in a mostly fragmented and individualized form - the 
  fact that resistance <I>is</I> so fragmented or hidden - reflects the historic 
  weakness of the class as a whole. The significance of this is that it is not 
  clear how such hidden and individualized forms of resistance can in themselves 
  necessarily take us to the point of no return. Unless they become overtly collective, 
  they operate merely as a form of antagonism that capital can cope with if not 
  recuperate. This is the moment of truth in Tronti and Panzieri's warnings about 
  the limits of autonomous struggle.
<P><B>4.2 Escaping the harness?</B><BR>
  Linked to this issue of retreat is the question of whether the working class 
  will be driving capital forward forever. Do the 'autonomists' argue too successfully 
  that class struggle is the motor? If working class struggle is always harnessed 
  by capital, how does it escape the harness?
<P>The argument that class struggle is alive and well in manifold forms is empowering; 
  but it risks ending up as a satisfaction with the current limits of the class 
  struggle. The focus on the validity and importance of the (plurality of) autonomous 
  struggles themselves can mean the abandonment of revolution as a totality. And 
  as the possibility and necessity of total revolution fades, so reformist campaigns, 
  premised upon the continued existence of the capital relation, become the focus. 
  A symptom of this worst side of post-<I>autonomia</I> is illustrated in demands 
  for a guaranteed income, which have allowed those influenced by <I>autonomia</I> 
  to link up with other reformists in campaigns which have dovetailed with capital's 
  current needs for welfare restructuring.<A NAME="[45]" HREF="#[45]B">[45]</A> 
  Although not all the major figures of <I>autonomia</I> or the 'autonomist Marxist' 
  scene would endorse this ultimately conservative view of the adequacy of fragmentation, 
  it is not inconsistent with an understanding of class struggle based around 
  the concept of autonomy. <BR>
<p class=subtitle>5. A political reading of <I>Capital</I>:<BR>
  From 20 yards of linen to the self-reduction of prices in one easy step</B>
<P>

<P>In his attempt to render a political reading of Marx's critique of political 
  economy, Harry Cleaver is again following in the workerist tradition: Negri's 
  'Marx on cycle and crisis', which was written in 1968, is an earlier example 
  of the attempt to connect Marx's categories with notions of strategy and struggle. 
  However, a sub-text of Cleaver's book is his defence of the importance of <I>Capital</I> 
  against the arguments made by (the later) Negri that, for the revolutionary 
  project of our time, <I>Capital</I> is superseded by the <I>Grundrisse</I>. 
  In <I>Marx beyond Marx</I>,<A NAME="[46]" HREF="#[46]B">[46]</A> Negri argues 
  that <I>Capital</I> has served to reduce critique to economic theory, that the 
  objectification of the categories in <I>Capital</I> functions to block action 
  by revolutionary subjectivity and to subject the subversive capacity of the 
  proletariat to the reorganizing and repressive intelligence of capitalist power. 
  The point of Marx's critique as whole is not 'intellectual' but revolutionary; 
  hence the <I>Grundrisse</I>, which is traversed throughout by an absolutely 
  insurmountable antagonism, is, according to Negri, the key text and can even 
  serve as a critique of the limits of <I>Capital</I>.
<P>Cleaver's <I>Reading 'Capital' Politically</I> argues that the right way to 
  read <I>Capital</I> and its fundamental categories such as value is 'strategically', 
  from the perspective of the working class. Cleaver therefore contends that any 
  'blockage' is due only to the inadequate ways in which <I>Capital</I> has been 
  read, and that the solution is to read it politically.
<P>We can agree with Cleaver that, despite the power of the <I>Grundrisse</I> 
  and its crucial indications that Marx's theoretical project was wider than the 
  material which appears in <I>Capital</I>,<A NAME="[47]" HREF="#[47]B">[47]</A> 
  <I>Capital</I> is nevertheless the better presentation of the critique of political 
  economy (as Marx himself clearly thought). But this is not the same as arguing 
  that a 'political' reading of <I>Capital</I> is useful or even tenable. Our 
  argument is that Cleaver's 'political' reading ultimately fails.
<P><B>5.1 Aims of <I>Reading 'Capital' Politically</I></B><BR>
  The focus of <I>Reading 'Capital' Politically</I> is the first three parts of 
  Chapter 1 of <I>Capital</I>, volume 1. Here, Marx shows how the commodity has 
  two aspects - use-value (a product of the concrete useful labour that creates 
  that particular commodity) and value (a representation of that labour considered 
  as general abstract labour); he shows how value must take different forms; and 
  from this he derives the logical necessity of money as the universal equivalent 
  form of value. Along with the chapter on money, these are undeniably some of 
  the most difficult parts of <I>Capital</I>. While a lot of the rest of the book 
  is fairly straightforward, this beginning is often enough to make the reader 
  turn away in frustration. Thus it is worth acknowledging the merit of Cleaver's 
  attempt at an accessible commentary.
<P>The central thesis of Cleaver's reading is that the category of value, in its 
  various forms (and aspects), needs to be related to class struggles around human 
  needs - to the subjective - rather than (simply) to the objective workings of 
  capital as a 'system'. In Cleaver's words, to read <I>Capital</I> politically 
  is "<I>to show how each category and relationship relates to and clarifies the 
  nature of the class struggle and to show what that means for the political strategy 
  of the working class</I>" (p. 76). Cleaver's attempt to render the subjective 
  in Marx's account of value operates by short-circuiting most of Marx's mediations, 
  leaping directly from the commodity-form to particular struggles. He relates 
  the material in <I>Capital</I>, Chapter 1, partly to later material in the same 
  volume over the struggle for the working day and primitive accumulation, but 
  most of all to more contemporary struggles - around energy and food prices - 
  in a way clearly distinct from Marx's own method.<A NAME="[48]" HREF="#[48]B">[48]</A> 
  He justifies this by saying "to the extent then that I bring to bear on the 
  interpretation of certain passages material from other parts of <I>Capital</I>, 
  or from other works, I do so with the aim of grasping Chapter One within the 
  larger analysis rather than reconstructing the evolution of what Marx wrote 
  and thought" (p. 94, second edition).
<P><B>5.2 Aims of <I>Capital</I></B><BR>
  A question Cleaver does not address is why is was that Marx said very little 
  about struggles in Volume 1, Chapter 1. If it is so necessary to read <I>Capital</I> 
  politically in the way that Cleaver does, then why didn't Marx save us the trouble 
  and simply write <I>Capital</I> politically? In promoting <I>Capital</I> as 
  a weapon for our struggles, Cleaver wants to stress the moments of de-reification 
  and de-fetishization in relation to Marx's categories. Indeed he claims that 
  this project of a political reading "is exactly the project called for in Marx's 
  discussion of fetishism" (p. 76). Thus for Cleaver there is no need for a "separate 
  analysis of Section 4 of Chapter One which deals with fetishism, simply because 
  … this whole essay involves going behind the appearances of the commodity-form 
  to get at the social relations" (p. 80). Cleaver is right that the section on 
  fetishism is crucial for "getting at the social relations"; but why did Marx 
  insist on the type of presentation he does despite the possible difficulty it 
  entailed for his intended audience, the working class? Moreover is Cleaver's 
  kind of political reading really the way to understand what Marx deals with 
  as commodity fetishism?
<P>An interesting comparison is Isaak Rubin's <I>Essays on Marx's Theory of Value</I>,<A NAME="[49]" HREF="#[49]B">[49]</A> 
  which Cleaver mentions only briefly and dismissively, in a footnote.<A NAME="[50]" HREF="#[50]B">[50]</A> 
  While Cleaver does not comment directly on the section in <I>Capital</I>, Chapter 
  1, on fetishism, the whole first part of Rubin's book is on this subject. Rubin's 
  book was seminal precisely for systematically grasping the inseparability of 
  commodity fetishism and Marx's theory of value: "The theory of fetishism is, 
  per se, the basis of Marx's entire economic system, and in particular of his 
  theory of value" (Rubin, 1973, p. 5). Thus the value categories are expressions 
  of a topsy-turvy world in which people's products dominate the producers, where 
  people are related through things, and where objects behave as subjects and 
  subjects as objects. Since Rubin's book became available in the English-speaking 
  world through Fredy Perlman's translation, a whole school of Marxism has developed, 
  insisting like Rubin does that Marx's is not a neo-Ricardian embodied labour 
  theory of value but an abstract social labour theory of value;<A NAME="[51]" HREF="#[51]B">[51]</A> 
  such an analysis brings fetishism to the fore and emphasises Marx's work as 
  a critique of political economy rather than Marxist political economy.
<P>Thus Rubin can be seen to make similar points to Cleaver but to do so by explaining and illustrating value-categories in terms of such basic mediations as social relations, labour and commodity fetishism, rather than through the directly political reading favoured by Cleaver. <P>
Moreover, the case of Rubin questions the schema Cleaver develops in his Introduction, summarized in the following table:<P>

<CENTER><B>Approaches to the reading of Marx</B> (Cleaver, p. 31)</CENTER>

<P>
<BR>
Cleaver (p. 30) defines the bottom right box of this table as:

<BLOCKQUOTE>that strategic reading of Marx which is done from the point of view of the working class. It is a reading that self-consciously and unilaterally structures its approach to determine the meaning and relevance of every concept to the immediate development of working-class struggle. It is a reading which eschews all detached interpretation and abstract theorising in favour of grasping concepts only within that concrete totality of struggle whose determinations they designate. This I would argue is the only kind of reading of Marx which can properly be said to be from a working-class perspective because it is the only one which speaks directly to the class's needs for clarifying the scope and structure of its own power and strategy. </BLOCKQUOTE>



<P>Though the Stalinist state recognized the political significance of Rubin's 
  'abstract reasoning',<A NAME="[52]" HREF="#[52]B">[52]</A> Rubin's book does 
  not meet Cleaver's 'political' criteria. But neither does Rubin's book seem 
  to be obviously a political economic or a philosophical reading. We'd contend 
  that one of the reasons that Rubin's is a seminal work is precisely because 
  it transcends such a distinction. Prompted by the revolutionary wave of the 
  1910s and 1920s, Rubin, like writers of the same period such as Lukács and Korsch, 
  was able to go beyond Second International Marxism and to understand Capital 
  as a critique of political economy - but without, like the Frankfurt School, 
  retreating into mere philosophy.
<P>The fourth part of <I>Capital</I>, Chapter 1, 'The Fetishism of the Commodity 
  and its Secret', is crucial because in it Marx shows how the forms of value 
  are an expression of reification, and hence fetishized in our experience. Rubin's 
  approach is key for drawing one's attention to the inseparability of fetishism 
  and the theory of value. By trying to short-circuit the process, by immediately 
  moving to the de-fetishising aspect of class struggle, Cleaver jumps levels 
  of abstraction. Our argument would be that, analytically, it is necessary to 
  explain reification before examining its reversal. In other words, in order 
  to relate value to the kind of struggles Cleaver refers to, a whole series of 
  mediations must be developed,<A NAME="[53]" HREF="#[53]B">[53]</A> not least 
  the categories of absolute and relative surplus-value, constant and variable 
  capital, and the relation between price and value (which Marx introduces later 
  in Volume 1), circulation (which Marx introduces in Volume 2) and the distributional 
  forms of surplus value - profit, rent and wages (which don't come until Volume 
  3). Volume 1 concerns capital-in-general, presented as particular examples of 
  capitalist enterprises as an analytic device to derive the later, more developed, 
  categories.
<P>For us it seems essential to grasp what Marx was trying to do in <I>Capital</I>. 
  If Marx's overall project was 'capitalism and its overthrow' it was nevertheless 
  necessary for him first to show what the capitalist mode of production was, 
  how it was possible; this led him methodologically to make a provisional closure 
  of class subjectivity in order to grasp the logic of capital as an objective 
  and positive system of economic 'laws' which is apparently independent of human 
  will and purpose.<A NAME="[54]" HREF="#[54]B">[54]</A> Objectivist Marxism takes 
  this provisional closure as complete. What Cleaver is doing could be seen to 
  be an attempt at opening up the provisional closure by bringing in the subjectivity 
  of class struggle; but because he does not properly explain the marginalization 
  of the class struggle in the pages of <I>Capital</I>, what he does comes across 
  as bald assertion at variance with the flow of Marx's argument.
<P>In short, in his understandable quest for the concrete and immediate, Cleaver abandons the analytic rigour needed to make the connections between <I>Capital</I> and the class struggle. While we may agree that Capital needs to be understood as a weapon in the class war, it does not need to be the crudely instrumental reading offered by Cleaver.
<P>&nbsp; 
<p class=subtitle>6. Whither <I>autonomia</I>?<P>

<P><B>6.1 Negri and the retreat from the universal revolutionary subject</B><BR>
  The continuing influence of <I>operaismo</I> and <I>autonomia</I> is evident 
  today in a number of recent movements, most notably perhaps Ya Basta! in Italy, 
  who draw upon some of the ideas of Negri. Negri himself has lately caused interest 
  in some circles. <I>Empire</I>, the book he has co-authored with Michael Hardt,<A NAME="[55]" HREF="#[55]B">[55]</A> 
  has struck a chord with the concerns of some 'anti-capitalist'/'globalization' 
  activists, academics and even a New Labour policy adviser.<A NAME="[56]" HREF="#[56]B">[56]</A> 
  While Negri's ideas were sometimes controversial when he was part of the area 
  of autonomy, after losing his connections to the movement he ceased to produce 
  worthwhile stuff, and instead slipped into an academic quagmire whose reformist 
  political implications are all too clear.<A NAME="[57]" HREF="#[57]B">[57]</A> 
  The disconnection of ideas from the movement, following the repression which 
  culminated in the mass arrests of 1979, has also meant that there has been to 
  some extent a battle for the heritage of the movement. Through journals like 
  <I>Zerowork</I> and <I>Midnight Notes</I>, Anglo-American theorists have kept 
  'autonomist Marxism' going. Through emphasizing the continuing importance of 
  value (albeit ambiguously, as we have seen), these and Harry Cleaver among others 
  have distinguished themselves from the late Negri with his embrace of both post-structuralism 
  and the ideas of the (pre-Hegelian) philosopher Spinoza.
<P>But - and despite his innumerable self-contradictions - a continuity can be 
  traced from the early Negri, through <I>autonomia</I> to the late Negri. For 
  example, his recent arguments, along with other reformists, for a guaranteed 
  income can be traced back to the demand for a 'political wage' made by the radical 
  Negri of <I>Potere Operaio</I>. It would seem to be significant that, despite 
  his earlier valuable insights, his relatively recent theoretical work can be 
  seen as at one with the arguments of Foucault, Deleuze and Guattari justifying 
  fragmented forms of resistance and denying the need to confront the state.
<P><I>Empire</I> contains any number of arguments we see as problematic if not 
  counter-revolutionary and recuperative, including the abandonment of value, 
  the centrality of immaterial labour, the call for 'real democracy' and political 
  proposals for 'global citizenship'. What stirred people's interest, it seemed, 
  was the thesis of 'empire' itself - that of the emergence of a single unified 
  global political-economic capitalist entity - which seemed to offer an alternative 
  to unsatisfactory orthodox theories of imperialism. With the US war on Afghanistan, 
  however, the notion of imperialism has returned to the forefront of political 
  discourse.<A NAME="[58]" HREF="#[58]B">[58]</A> What we are left with, then, 
  as Negri's take on <I>autonomia</I>, is a celebration of fragmentation. The 
  abandonment of the concept of the proletariat (now replaced by 'the multitude'), 
  the universal revolutionary subject, is the abandonment of world revolution. 
  Negri's work might therefore be said to express the profound sense of defeat 
  and disillusion that followed the failure of the Movement of 1977.
<P><B>6.2 History as ideology</B><BR>
  Two different ways of writing history are evident in the books by Steve Wright 
  and Harry Cleaver. Wright's is a history of the politics of a movement. But 
  it is also critical, from a communist perspective. We therefore thoroughly recommend 
  it as an invaluable resource in helping our understanding of the development, 
  contributions and tensions of workerism and autonomia in their historical context 
  of Italy in the 1950s, '60s and '70s.
<P>By contrast, for us, Cleaver's account of the tradition of <I>autonomia</I> 
  is far more tendentious. Rather than focusing, as Wright does, on what is clearly 
  a single historical episode, Cleaver selects a number of different movements 
  and theorists, going back as far as C.L.R. James and Raya Dunayevskaya, which 
  he then designates as representatives of what he calls "autonomist Marxism". 
  Again, here Cleaver is consistent with the tradition of workerist historiography 
  which, looking back, found the mass worker and hence a commonality with its 
  own perspective in earlier struggles, such as the Wobblies and the working class 
  movement in Germany in the 1920s.
<P>In one sense it might seem there's nothing wrong with Cleaver's attempt simply 
  to identify what he sees as the revolutionary use of Marx as a particular tradition. 
  And if we look at the groups and theorists that he refers to (both in <I>Reading 
  'Capital' Politically</I> and also in his university course on 'autonomist Marxism'<A NAME="[59]" HREF="#[59]B">[59]</A>) 
  a very great deal of it corresponds with our own assessment of the most valuable 
  contributions.
<P>However, there are two, related, problems. First, in grouping the various movements 
  and theorists together in the way that he does there is an element of the same 
  homogenizing or flattening out - a neglect of differences - that we saw in Cleaver's 
  'autonomist' class analysis, as well as in the workerist concepts of mass worker 
  and so on.
<P>Second, it is revealing to consider which tendencies are excluded from Cleaver's 
  canon, or at least addressed in only a cursory way. How might these neglected 
  tendencies be in tension with the rest of the material? What contradictions 
  might the formulation 'autonomist Marxism' suppress?
<P>For us, as an account of developments in theory over the past century, the 
  most notable absences from <I>Reading 'Capital' Politically</I> are the Situationist 
  International<A NAME="[60]" HREF="#[60]B">[60]</A> and the Italian left and 
  those influenced by it, such as Barrot/Dauvé and Camatte. We can go so far as 
  to say that the attempt to specify such a thing as 'autonomist Marxism' is ideological, 
  with its emphasis on 'similar' ideas and its concealments (the glossing of the 
  limits of the 'good' theorists and movements, the silence on those that don't 
  fit). This is not unusual or strange. The capitalist counter-offensive which 
  culminated in the defeat of the Movement of 1977 saw a disillusionment with 
  the possibility of mass revolutionary change that was expressed in the destinations 
  of those coming out of the area of autonomy: most went into the PCI or the armed 
  groups. Likewise, the turning of the general insights of the <I>operaismo</I> 
  and <I>autonomia</I> theorists into 'autonomist Marxism' can be seen as a reflection 
  of the retreat of the movement giving rise to the ideas. Ideology is the freezing 
  of theory; theory freezes when the practice on which it is based is halted. 
  'Autonomism' seems to be non-dogmatic and dynamic because of the emphasis on 
  particular needs and diverse struggles etc.; but the very principle of openness 
  to new struggles has itself become ideological as the wave of struggles has 
  ebbed.
<P>Thus the glossing of the limitations of those currents that Cleaver gives approval 
  to, and even cites as exemplifying autonomous struggle (e.g. Wages for Housework),<A NAME="[61]" HREF="#[61]B">[61]</A> 
  goes hand in hand with the exclusion of those that would contribute to the critique 
  of those same currents. Any radical current needs to critique itself in order 
  transcend itself, as in the proletariat's self-liberation through self-abolition. 
  Cleaver's identification of a thing with the label 'autonomist Marxism' is ideological 
  in that it is partial and attempts to close off rather than open up a pathway 
  to its own self-critique.
<P><B>6.3 Towards a critical appraisal and appropriation of the contributions 
  of the workerists</B><BR>
  While Cleaver's book, and particularly his Introduction, has been important 
  to many of us in the past, we would suggest now that Wright's book is more helpful 
  than <I>Reading 'Capital' Politically</I> in allowing us to appropriate the 
  best contributions of the workerist tradition. Wright ends his book with the 
  sentence "Having helped to force the lock … obstructing the understanding of 
  working-class behaviour in and against capital, only to disintegrate in the 
  process, the workerist tradition has bequeathed to others the task of making 
  sense of those treasures which lie within." In many ways Italian workerist analyses 
  of class struggle promised much, but delivered little. The whole tendency, increasingly 
  divided into separate camps, collapsed at the end of the '70s. Whereas one camp 
  favoured libertarian themes of autonomy, personal development and the subjective 
  determinations of class identity; the other instead turned to debates over the 
  'armed party' and the feasibility of civil war. Both camps abandoned the traditional 
  workerist focus on the relationship between technical and political class composition 
  - that is, between the class's material structure in the labour process and 
  its behaviour as a subject autonomous from dictates of both the labour movement 
  and capital.
<P>But what can we take from the whole experience? The "complex dialectic of decomposition 
  and recomposition" of class forces, first elaborated by Tronti and others, was 
  a significant departure from traditional leftist understanding of class struggle; 
  the right questions were being asked: what material determinants are there in 
  understanding the behaviour of the working class as (revolutionary) subject? 
  But if the right questions were being asked, the answers the workerists provided 
  were not always satisfactory; and tendency was often confused with totality. 
  The early workerists were rightly criticized for their unwillingness to theorise 
  moments of class struggle outside the large factories, and perhaps also for 
  seeing the wage as the privileged locus of struggle; however their <I>autonomia</I> 
  successors could be equally criticized for their problematic abandonment of 
  the 'mass worker'.
<P>Wright's book focuses on the concept of class composition, workerism's most 
  distinctive contribution. Class composition was important as an attempt to express 
  how the working class is an active subject, and thus takes us beyond the poverty 
  of objectivist Marxism which portrayed the working class as passive and dependent. 
  The concept grew from the experience of autonomous struggle when the working 
  class was on the offensive, but is has come to seem less adequate when relied 
  upon in periods of crisis and retreat. To what extent was there a political 
  recomposition of the class with the decline of the mass worker? Was the 'socialized 
  worker' made concrete by the self-reduction struggles of the 1970s and the student 
  and unemployed movements of 1977? Certainly a multiplicity of struggles erupted 
  on the social level. But did the struggles merge, did the new subjectivities 
  forged in struggle coalesce? Class recomposition would entail the formation 
  of an increasingly self-conscious proletarian movement. The dispersal of workers 
  (<I>operaio disseminato</I>), and the displacement of struggle to the wider 
  social terrain, because of the fluidity of situations and multiplicity of moments 
  of struggle, make it harder for a self-conscious movement to emerge. But some 
  in the area of autonomy point to the very same factors as having the potential 
  for rapid transmission of struggles to all sectors of the class. But, while 
  the refusal of work and the liberation of needs manifested themselves in many 
  different ways in the struggles of the '70s (proletarian youth circles, riots, 
  'free shopping' or reappropriations, squatting, organized 'self-reduction' of 
  rent, utility bills and transport fares etc.), they did not develop into the 
  political movement around the wage (redefined as a guaranteed social income) 
  that Negri theorized - let alone into any coherent class movement capable of 
  overturning capitalist social relations.
<P>If this review article has devoted so much space to the problems of workerism and <I>autonomia</I> it is only because of the historic importance of this current. Today, ideas such as the non-neutrality of machinery and factory organization, the focus on immediate struggles and needs (rather than a separate 'politics'), and the anti-capitalist nature of struggles outside (as well as within) the workplace are characteristic of many radical circles, not all of which would call themselves Marxist. The workerists were among the first to theorize these issues. The extent to which their arguments have been echoed by radicals down the years (as well as co-opted and distorted by recuperators) is an index of their articulation of the negation of the capital relation.

<P><A NAME="[12]B" HREF="#[12]">[12]</A>  Negri introduced the term 'self-valorization' for this process of autonomous self-development. See <I>Marx Beyond Marx: Lessons on the 'Grundrisse'</I> (New York/London: Autonomedia/Pluto, 1991). The attraction of the concept lies in its implication that the working class is an active subject, not just a function of capital's valorization needs, and whose strategy is to take what it needs. However, in Marx, the concept of 'valorization' refers to capital's own operation - specifically, its use of our activity to expand value, that is, our alienated labour. It therefore seems extremely odd to employ it to refer to our activity against capital - unless that activity too is itself alienated in some way. In the preface to the second edition of <I>Reading 'Capital' Politically</I>, Cleaver acknowledges that the concept is problematic (as he does in his interview with Massimo de Angelis in <I>Vis-à-Vis </I>, 1993). However, he still uses it to explain that, in being against capital, autonomous struggles are also for 'a diverse variety of new ways of being'.

It can be thought of in terms of those practices which echo some of the language of communism but which in fact represent the movement of the left-wing of capital. However, for us an important point is to get away from the picture in which there is a pure class struggle only interfered with and prevented from generating communism by the interference of an exterior force (from the bourgeoisie) of leftism. A question arises of why the class struggle allows itself to be so diverted. It is important to recognize that, though some leftists are clearly part of the bourgeoisie or at least of the state, the power of leftism/trade unionism etc. comes from the fact that the working class generates leftism from within itself as an expression of its own current limits. <P>

<P><A NAME="[48]B" HREF="#[48]">[48]</A> On the other hand, Cleaver also contends that what he is doing is not so different from Marx: "Marx illustrates these relations [of use-value and exchange-value] with a variety of apparently innocuous commodities: linen, iron, watches, and corn (wheat). I say apparently because most of these commodities played a key role in the period of capitalist development which Marx analysed: linen in the textile industry, iron in the production of machinery and cannon, watches in the timing of work, wheat as the basic means of subsistence of the working class. To be just as careful in this exposition, I suggest that we focus on the key commodities of the current period: labour power, food and energy". (p. 98). However, while Cleaver is probably right that Marx did not make an arbitrary choice of which commodities to mention in Chapter 1, their function in Marx's presentation is arbitrary. Unlike the political economists, Marx does give attention to the use-value side of the economy; but here in his opening chapter he makes no mention of the concreteness of these use-values in the class struggle. At this point of Marx's presentation of the capitalist mode of production, the precise use-values are irrelevant. Marx's reference to linen, corn etc. is a part of a logical presentation, not a reference to concrete struggles.<P>

<P><A NAME="[50]B" HREF="#[50]">[50]</A> Cleaver's claim (p. 138) that while Marxists have examined the question of the content of value at length almost no work has been done on the issue of the form of value (and hence the necessity for Cleaver's own analysis) includes reference to Rubin. But this in itself suggests that Cleaver hasn't understood (and perhaps hasn't even read) Rubin's book, the whole of which is concerned precisely with the social form of value.<PI>

<P><A NAME="[51]B" HREF="#[51]">[51]</A> Up until the 1970s, at least in the English 
  speaking world, Marx was seen as having simply developed and refined Ricardo's 
  labour theory of value. In this traditional interpretation, Marx, like Ricardo, 
  was seen to adhere to an embodied labour conception of value. What was common 
  to all commodities, and hence what it was that made them commensurate with each 
  other as manifestations of this common factor, was that they were all products 
  of the "expenditure of human brains, nerves and muscles", that is of human labour 
  in general. Consequently, the value of a commodity was seen to be determined 
  by the labour embodied in it during its production.
<P> With this physiological, or quasi-physicalist, conception of labour, the Ricardian 
  labour theory of value conceived value as merely a technical relation: the value 
  of a commodity was simply determined by the amount of labour-energy necessary 
  for its production. As such the Ricardian labour theory of value could in principle 
  be applied to any form of society.
<P> For Rubin, what was specific about the capitalist mode of production was that 
  producers did not produce products for their own immediate needs but rather 
  produced commodities for sale. The labour allocated to the production of any 
  particular commodity was not determined prior to production by custom or by 
  a social plan and therefore it was not immediately social labour. Labour only 
  became social labour, a recognised part of the social division of labour, through 
  sale of the commodity it produced. Furthermore, the exchange of commodities 
  was a process of real abstraction through which the various types of concrete 
  labour were reduced to a common substance - abstract social labour. This abstract 
  social labour was the <I>social</I> substance of value. Rubin's abstract social 
  labour theory of value necessarily entailed an account of commodity fetishism 
  since it was concerned with how labour as a social relation must manifest itself 
  in the form of value in a society in which relations between people manifest 
  themselves as relations between things.
<P>	In the mid-1970s the labour theory of value came under attack from the neo-Ricardian school which argued that it was both redundant and inconsistent. Rubin's abstract social labour theory of value was then rediscovered as a response to such criticisms in the late 1970s. Although Cleaver dismisses Rubin there have been attempts to address his abstract social labour theory of value from the tradition of <I>autonomia</I> - see for example the article by Massimo De Angelis in <I>Capital & Class</I>, 57 (Autumn 1995).<P>

<P><A NAME="[52]B" HREF="#[52]">[52]</A> "An official Soviet philosopher wrote that 'The followers of Rubin and the Menshevizing Idealists ... treated Marx's revolutionary method in the spirit of Hegelianism... The Communist Party has smashed these trends alien to Marxism.' ... Rubin was imprisoned, accused of belonging to an organization that never existed, forced to 'confess' to events that never took place, and finally removed from among the living."
