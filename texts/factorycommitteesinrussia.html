<p class="title">The Experience of the Factory Committees in the Russian Revolution</p>
<p class="author">by R.M. Jones</p>
<p class="subtitle">Introduction</p>
<p>&quot;For the Russian workman to live meant simply not to die.&quot; [1] Before 
  February 1917, Russian workers endured military discipline in the work-place 
  with compulsory overtime, a high death rate in industrial 'accidents' and hunger 
  once they got home. In 1905 they had taken on the Tsarist monarchy and created 
  something entirely new in that struggle -- the soviet (or council). Twelve years 
  later, after more than two years of war and on a growing wave of strikes, they 
  were ready to overthrow Tsarism. In doing so, they once again created their 
  own organizations -- soviets and factory committees. As they destroyed the old, 
  so they had to construct a new society. For the workers that meant changing 
  the conditions of their lives, especially in their work. ''For it is not machines 
  nor factories, but human interrelationships that make the essence of socialism.&quot; 
  [2]</p>
<p>Alongside the Russian workers' attempts to create socialism -- not as some 
  abstract far-off utopia in a political party program, but through confronting 
  and changing the concrete reality of their everyday life -- were the activities 
  of socialist parties, supposedly sympathetic to working class aspirations. This 
  pamphlet tells the story of the Russian workers' struggle, in particular the 
  efforts of the factory committees. The success of the Bolsheviks in defeating 
  the working class and crushing all hope of socialism is the other side of the 
  story. Today's supporters of Lenin and Trotsky still parade their writings and 
  their politics as relevant to the working class and to socialism. It is still 
  necessary then to expose how fundamentally capitalistic their political approach 
  was when faced with a working class taking power where it mattered -- in the 
  workplace, through the factory committees, and in the community, through the 
  local soviets. The negative side of this pamphlet is Bolshevism; the positive 
  side is what workers achieved, and tried to achieve, even in defeat.</p>
<p class="subtitle">
  The February Revolution</p>
<p>
  It was the working class women of Petrograd who sparked off the revolution in 
  February. After weeks of strikes with police attacks on factories, the most 
  oppressed part of the working class, the women textile workers, took the initiative. 
  Demands for bread and attacks on bakeries were superseded by a massive demonstration 
  of women workers on International Women's Day. The women had ignored a local 
  Bolshevik directive to wait until May Day! The early slogan of &quot;Bread!&quot; 
  was quickly followed by &quot;Down with the autocracy! Down with the war!&quot; 
  By February 24th, half of Petrograd was on strike. The workers did go to their 
  factories, not to work, but to hold meetings, pass resolutions and then go out 
  to demonstrate. The Vyborg committee of the Bolsheviks opposed the strikes: 
  &quot;(...) since the committee thought the time unripe for militant action 
  -- the party not strong enough and the workers having too few contacts with 
  the soldiers -- they decided not to call for strikes but to prepare for revolutionary 
  action at some indefinite time in the future.'' [3]</p>
<p>
  Unaware of how 'unripe' the time was, the workers pressed on with the strike 
  till 240,000 were out. Strikers and demonstrators clashed with armed police, 
  and approached soldiers for support, above all for weapons. The Bolshevik Central 
  Committee finally got round to calling for a general strike just as the already 
  existing strike was becoming an armed uprising. By the evening of February 24th 
  the Vyborg district of Petrograd was held by the revolutionaries: the police 
  stations were wrecked, and the police kicked out altogether; prisoners were 
  released, and contacts made with neighboring districts. The following evening 
  the 4th company of the Pavlovsky Regiment mutinied and opened fire on police. 
  On the 27th workers 'visited' all the jails in Petrograd and released political 
  prisoners. The soldiers had already come over to the revolution, when a single 
  Bolshevik organization produced an appeal to the army, which didn't even urge 
  the soldiers to support the workers.</p>
<p>
  The speed and success of this revolution from below took all the socialists 
  -- who had been propagandizing for a revolution for years by surprise. &quot;The 
  leaders were watching the movement from above; they hesitated, they lagged -- 
  in other words, they did not lead. They dragged after the movement. The nearer 
  one comes to the factories, the greater the decisiveness.&quot; [4] Instead 
  of talking and writing, the workers and soldiers just got on and did it. They 
  started to set up their own organizations to meet their needs. The socialists 
  now found the workers behaving in ways they hadn't expected. &quot;The leaders 
  of the Revolution also did not understand that, once they themselves had invited 
  the people to take over local affairs, the people, who had had enough of being 
  led and regimented, would eagerly respond to the idea of self-government through 
  soviets, of ending the fighting; they would dream of a new life.&quot; [5] The 
  workers would now only accept decisions from above if they agreed with them 
  anyway. Faced with the 'chaos' of workers acting for themselves, calls for 'discipline' 
  resounded from the Bolshevik Stalin, from the moderate socialist Gorky and from 
  the patriotic anarchist Prince Kropotkin. </p>
<p>
  Similarly, the socialists did not listen to the demands rising up from the workers 
  and peasants. The workers called for an eight hour day, an end to piecework, 
  equal pay, an end to child labor, improvements in safety at work and politeness 
  from management! These early demands were a reflection of the desire to humanize 
  work and to give workers some dignity. The women workers likewise demanded equal 
  wages and better conditions and hygiene at work. The new egalitarianism was 
  also expressed in another way by workers: only the present was of importance; 
  no one could claim any kind of superiority or priority by virtue of what they 
  had done in the past. The slate was to be wiped clean: when Khrustalev-Nosav 
  claimed a seat on the executive committee of the Petrograd Soviet on the basis 
  that he had been President of the Soviet in 1905, he was rejected with boos.</p>
<p class="subtitle">
  The Establishment Of The Factory Committees</p>
<p>
  An industrialist called Auerbach complained that &quot;the revolution was understood 
  by the lower orders as something in the nature of an Easter carnival: servants, 
  for example, disappeared for whole days, promenaded in red ribbons, took rides 
  in automobiles, came home in the morning only long enough to wash up and again 
  went out for fun.&quot; [6] While some set out to use the new freedom to see 
  how the old ruling class had whiled away its time, others aimed at constructive 
  tasks. Factory committees made their appearance: one of the first started on 
  March 2nd when the Petrograd 1st Electricity Works elected a 24 member council 
  (including 10 Bolsheviks). By the end of March, similar councils and committees 
  existed in nearly every plant in Petrograd and Moscow: they were especially 
  strong in the metal works.</p>
<p>
  The Petrograd Soviet, then controlled by moderate socialists hostile to workers' 
  control, set March 5th as the day for a return to work (always the most important 
  thing -- get the workers working), while trying straightaway to steer the new 
  factory committees into a 'helpful' role. On March 7th it stated: &quot;For 
  the control of factory and shop administration, for the proper organization 
  of work, factory and shop committees should be formed at once. They should see 
  to it that the forces of labor are not wasted and look after working conditions 
  in the plant.&quot; [7] The soviets did not fight for the eight hour day that 
  workers were demanding until workers in Moscow and Petrograd simply stopped 
  after eight hours and left the factories. On March 10th the Petrograd Owners 
  Association capitulated over the eight hour day, and in an agreement with the 
  Soviet, 'permitted' the formation of factory committees, while trying to limit 
  them in every way. Moscow saw a longer struggle: when the local Soviet called 
  for a return to work, the workers stayed out, forcing the Soviet to declare 
  the eight hour day to be in force from March 21st, at which point the employers 
  conceded. The Russian workers had won a first battle through their own efforts, 
  no thanks to the socialist-dominated soviets. They now had more time to meet, 
  discuss, read and -- importantly -- take rifle practice.</p>
<p>
  The factory committees themselves were able to cater for this newfound spare 
  time: armed workers' militias were established at factories, education classes 
  got under way. The committees took on all sorts of tasks without waiting for 
  any 'permission' from the soviets or the Provisional Government. Where no trade 
  unions existed, they entered into wage bargaining and opened the books of the 
  firm. The committees supervised the hiring and firing of workers. Given the 
  sabotage of employers, some of whom simply abandoned their enterprises, the 
  committees aimed at first to keep production going, getting the materials, maintaining 
  the machinery, fulfilling orders: in an atmosphere of growing economic collapse, 
  it was the committees who were playing a constructive role, even if it was as 
  yet a very partial form of workers' control. The distinction between control, 
  which implies supervision and inspection of other people's decisions, and management, 
  which implies decision-making, was not lost on the workers though. The factory 
  committee of the massive Putilov works in Petrograd, elected by 90% of the workforce, 
  stated in late April: &quot;While the workers of the particular enterprises 
  educate themselves in self-management, they prepare themselves for the moment 
  when private ownership of the factories will be abolished and the means of production 
  will be transferred into the hands of the working class. This great and important 
  goal for which the workers are striving must be kept steadfastly in mind, even 
  if we are carrying out only small details in the meantime.&quot; [8]</p>
<p>
  The factory committees recognized the need to co-ordinate their activities outside 
  the confines of individual plants. Moves to centralize started when representatives 
  from the committees of the twelve largest metal works met in Petrograd on March 
  13th, less than three weeks after the revolution. Although this meeting set 
  up no permanent organization, an early April conference of factory committees 
  in Moscow, and similar ones in some provinces, set up co-coordinating centers 
  to establish links between cities. A conference of workers in the factories 
  of the Artillery and Naval Department approved the committees' role in hiring 
  and firing, seeing the books and so on. Radical committees were ignoring the 
  law and going their own way as circumstances demanded. The conference, held 
  on April 15th, also planned a Chief Centre to co-ordinate the state sector factory 
  committees. At the end of April, the Putilov works committee called for a more 
  broadly-based conference. On May 29th a factory committee conference in Kharkov 
  passed a resolution that the committees should be &quot;organs of insurrection&quot; 
  and that they should seize the factories and manage production. Clearly some 
  workers were thinking ahead and had a clearer notion of what would be required 
  for their aspirations to be satisfied.</p>
<p>
  By May, the hopes of February were wearing thin: the new government was a failure 
  as far as workers were concerned, and strikes were being met by lay-offs. Workers 
  and factory committees found themselves forced to take over factories because 
  of the management's actions, rather than any commitment to socialism or self-management 
  as such. The 'First Conference of the Factory Committees of Petrograd and its 
  Environs', the one called for by the Putilov workers, met from May 30th-June 
  5th. It had delegates from 367 factory committees representing 337,464 workers 
  in Petrograd (out of a total of some 400,000). The main debate was over who 
  was to run industry: the moderate socialists wanted state control by the government; 
  the workers wanted workers' control, and in this they were supported by the 
  anarcho-syndicalists and the Bolsheviks, recent converts to the idea. But while 
  workers tended to imagine that 'workers' control' meant they would run things, 
  the Bolsheviks' conception was rather different. Lenin (no use asking which 
  factory committee he was on) spoke at the conference, and had this to say: &quot;(...) 
  a majority of workers should enter all responsible institutions and (...) the 
  administration should render an account of its actions to all the most authoritative 
  workers' organizations.&quot; [9] Clearly here there is an administration on 
  one side, and the workers on the other: the division as in any class society. 
  In the Bolshevik resolution that was passed, factory committees were to be &quot;allowed 
  to participate&quot; in control along with the soviets, the unions and representatives 
  of political parties!</p>
<p>
  A Central Council of Factory Committees for Petrograd was formed with 25 members. 
  Its jobs included getting fuel, materials and machinery, distributing information 
  and setting up a committee to organize aid for the peasants. It was able to 
  help the weaker committees in their struggles, and from then on it was in more 
  or less permanent session. The Petrograd Central Council also sent delegates 
  to other cities. By the end of June there were 25 similar Factory Committee 
  Centers in cities and districts; by October, 65 such centers existed and there 
  had been over a hundred conferences discussing the problems facing the factory 
  committees. The report of the Petrograd conference noted that &quot;(...) at 
  the moment, committees are forced to intervene in the economic functioning of 
  businesses, otherwise they would have stopped working.&quot; [10]</p>
<p>
  At the end of June the factory committee at the Brenner factory stated explicitly 
  &quot;In view of the management's refusal to go on with production, the workers' 
  committee has decided, in general assembly, to fulfill the orders and to carry 
  on working.&quot; [11] The extreme hostility of the employers to the committees 
  was encouraging an economic collapse, which could only be staved off by the 
  committees linking up locally, regionally and nationally. The Provisional Government, 
  the trade unions and the soviets (under the control of moderate socialists were 
  definitely not sympathetic to the factory committees. The workers had initially 
  identified with the Petrograd Soviet: its weakness and inability or refusal 
  to take up workers' demands strengthened the committees. As the committees co-coordinated 
  up to a national level, they came into conflict with the trade unions; as they 
  started to act politically, they came up against the 'socialist' soviets. The 
  committees had allies in the district committees, set up throughout Petrograd, 
  partly to defend the city. Their authority and effectiveness was such that people 
  turned to them to get things done. They set up canteens, cr&egrave;ches, cultural 
  centers; they tackled alcoholism and gambling; they took over empty houses, 
  and tried to organize food supply.</p>
<p>
  In the large factories the factory committee's were subdivided into commissions 
  for each part of the plant's productive activity. For example, the Mednoprokatny 
  metal works had nine such commissions, covering fuel purchase, orders, working 
  conditions, employment and dismissal, a library, demobilization (i.e., the change 
  from wartime to peacetime production), metal recovery, co-ordination, control. 
  Undoubtedly it was the skilled workers who tended to dominate in the committee 
  movement as a whole, and in the individual work-places. They knew how the plants 
  operated, they were more literate and used to organizing themselves through 
  the long years of Tsarist repression. However this is not to understate the 
  role of the less skilled. Petrograd's workforce had doubled during the war, 
  and the recent peasant intake was often more radical, being anti-Tsarist and 
  immediately anti-capitalist. It was these workers who pressed for wage equalization 
  -- and many skilled militants took up the call. </p>
<p>
  The committees leaned towards the Bolsheviks because they were a good deal more 
  radical than the moderate socialist Mensheviks, and because they 'supported' 
  the factory committees. In fact it was the factory committees, at the sharp 
  end of the struggle with the employers, which were the first workers' organizations 
  to 'go Bolshevik'. A Bolshevik resolution at the June conference won 335 out 
  of 421 votes. However, it was the workers and not the politicians who were left 
  to sort out the real, practical problems, such as, how to react to the employers' 
  increasing use of lockouts. One worker, fed up with the endless talking of the 
  political militants, addressed himself to the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks together 
  at a conference: &quot;I've had enough of all your talking. You never answer 
  our questions -- what are we to do if a boss threatens he'll close down? You're 
  always ready with proclamations and words, but no one will ever tell us what 
  to do in a real case (...) what do we do if the factory shuts down? We are here 
  to decide that, and we've been sent here for that, and if you don't tell us, 
  we'll go ahead on our own.&quot; [12]</p>
<p class="subtitle">
  Soviets, Parties &amp; Unions</p>
<p>
  The Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks were fighting for the leadership of the working 
  class, not to solve workers' problems. The workers themselves tended to pay 
  little attention to the differences between the various left-wing groups and 
  parties, differences which mattered a great deal to the socialists themselves. 
  Rank-and-file Bolsheviks and Mensheviks had often united in the early days after 
  the February Revolution anyway: as the moderate socialists discredited themselves, 
  the Bolsheviks were able to win more support as the uncompromising party. February 
  had given workers the freedom to combine, and they were able to force concessions 
  from employers and government on the eight hour day, better working conditions, 
  social insurance and so on. When, out of necessity, the move to self-management 
  started, it was not only something alien to the workers' original demands, but 
  also to every socialist organization, and to the trade unions. By May there 
  were some 2,000 unions with 1.5 million members; by October, two million members. 
  Some of the unions existed in name only, with paper membership; others did nothing. 
  The active trade unions wanted the factory committees to be local branches of 
  the unions and little else.</p>
<p>
  For their part, the committees, which had been far quicker to organize and take 
  up grievances, were in favor of co-operating with the unions, but certainly 
  not of being subordinate to them.</p>
<p>
  The unions were dominated politically by the Mensheviks. For them, the revolution 
  was a bourgeois-democratic one, ushering in a period of straightforward capitalism: 
  thus the task was to establish trade unions as in Western Europe to organize 
  and defend workers. They were for state control over the economy, in which there 
  was to be no room for factory committees or workers' control. As the Menshevik 
  Dalin put, it: &quot;The factory committees must see only that production continues 
  but they should not take production and the factories into their own hands (...) 
  If the owner discards the enterprise, it must pass not into the hands of the 
  workers but to the jurisdiction of the city or central government.&quot; [13] 
  Either the capitalists or the bourgeois state were to run industry, never the 
  workers.</p>
<p>
  A directly contrary view was taken by the anarcho-syndicalists, for whom the 
  factory committees were the beginnings of the future socialist society. Maksimov 
  and the 'Golos Truda' group called for &quot;total workers' control&quot; over 
  the process of production itself. Their critical attitude towards the unions 
  and solid support for the committees gave the anarcho-syndicalists some influence 
  on workers, particularly in Vyborg and Kronstadt. However their antipathy to 
  centralization left them vague about how the factory committees should link 
  up across the country.</p>
<p>
  The Bolsheviks occupied what appeared to be an ambiguous position, shifting 
  their emphasis from the committees to the unions, from workers' control to state 
  control. This was partly a reflection of the differences between the party leadership, 
  which (apart from Lenin) was unsure as to what it wanted at first, and the rank-and-file 
  members, who, many of them being workers, were active in the factory committees. 
  Lenin's April Theses set the tone for his line of thought: &quot;Not the 'introduction' 
  of socialism as our immediate task, but immediate transition merely to control 
  by the Soviet of Workers' Deputies over the social production and distribution 
  of products.&quot; In 'Pravda' on June 4th Lenin was to repeat that workers' 
  control would be carried out by the soviets: the factory committees didn't rate 
  a mention. For Lenin, workers' control was a form of accountancy, and socialism 
  merely state control of production. Many militants in the party thought a decisive 
  transformation of society was at stake. Navimov, a Bolshevik worker on the Central 
  Council of Factory Committees, said at the first conference of Petrograd factory 
  committees; &quot;Control must be created from below and not from above, created 
  democratically and not bureaucratically, and I call upon you to take this mission 
  upon yourselves. Only we workers can achieve what is necessary for our future 
  existence.&quot; [14]</p>
<p>
  The Bolsheviks had helped set up the Central Council of Factory Committees, 
  but were using the committees in the struggle to win control of the trade unions 
  from the Mensheviks. At the All-Russian Trade Union Conference in June, Milyutin, 
  the Bolshevik representative, said that the committees should be union cells, 
  and workers' control would be exercised by the unions and the soviets. It has 
  to be said that before February no Bolshevik had given any thought to workers' 
  control and the problems attached to it: however their basic political assumptions 
  were already starting to drive them against the real workers' movement. As the 
  committees themselves were not always united, and were unclear over their relationships 
  with other institutions and workers' organizations, the conflict did not assume 
  a concrete form until after October.</p>
<p>
  In 1905, the Soviet of Workers' Deputies had risen out of a general strike. 
  In 1917 this creation was resurrected, but with a difference: socialists set 
  up a Provisional Executive Committee of the Soviet both independently of and 
  in advance of the workers. A leadership established itself that had no workers 
  in it. These first Soviet leaders were moderate socialists, who hoped in fact 
  to phase out the soviets as the apparatus of a bourgeois-democratic republic 
  was created. Some minor soviet elections occurred as early as February 24th; 
  city-wide elections were held on the 28th in Petrograd, the day after the Provisional 
  Executive Committee was formed. These elections allowed for one deputy per thousand 
  voters, or one per small factory, with one per company of soldiers (usually 
  250 men). Thus the large factories containing some 87% of workers had 424 delegates, 
  the small factories with the remaining 13% had 422, and the soldiers had some 
  2,000, by mid-March. Not only did the soldiers have an excessive influence in 
  the Soviet, but also the workers' delegates were frequently not workers, but 
  middle class radicals of one sort or another.</p>
<p>
  The Petrograd Provisional Executive Committee started with 42 members: this 
  initially included seven workers and eight soldiers who were all soon ousted. 
  The Bolshevik Shlyapnikov had successfully proposed that each socialist party 
  should have two seats automatically on the Executive. In the event, all parties, 
  large trade unions and co-operatives were allowed to send two delegates. Thus 
  Stalin and Kamenev of the Bolsheviks, both well-known Petrograd workers, got 
  onto the committee unelected. At the first Congress of Soviets there were 57 
  executive officers, including just four workers, one sailor and one soldier. 
  No soldier or worker spoke throughout the whole proceedings: all speeches were 
  made by party members, not one of them working class.</p>
<p>
  The dominating role of the Mensheviks and the Social Revolutionaries, another 
  moderate socialist party, was reflected in the way that the Petrograd Soviet 
  urged a return to work in March before the Provisional Government conceded the 
  eight hour day, or made any move towards peace and a settlement of the land 
  question. It was mass action and the threat of a general strike that had gained 
  workers the shorter working day. The Soviet similarly tried to limit workers' 
  control by setting up 'Labor Mediation Boards' to settle disputes. It tried 
  to restrain anti-war demonstrations. The moderate socialists were after all 
  looking to the bourgeoisie to institute western-style capitalism, not to the 
  workers to create socialism. Despite that, the Provisional Executive Committee 
  found itself under intense pressure from the workers. It was forced to take 
  over the State Bank, the Treasury, Mint and Printing Office; post and telegraph 
  offices, railway stations and other printing works were also seized. As early 
  as March 6th, meetings of militant workers were demanding that the Soviet take 
  power. However these early demands for &quot;all power to the soviets'' were 
  opposed by many workers, most soldiers and overwhelmingly by the socialist leaders 
  of the Soviet itself. The Bolsheviks at this stage supported the idea of the 
  Soviet supporting the Provisional Government.</p>
<p>
  By June there were 519 soviets, 28 of which were working class alone, 101 were 
  workers' and soldiers', 305 were workers', soldiers' and peasants', the rest 
  being all-class. The majority of these soviets were run by non-working class 
  party activists. Once party militants got into these higher soviets, they controlled 
  the other posts. For instance, Anisimov, the chairman of the soviet of district 
  committees was not elected to any district committee at all -- he had been selected 
  by his Menshevik colleagues. In the view of these socialists, clearly some were 
  destined to rule, others to be ruled. The Bolsheviks too were happy to build 
  up majorities for themselves by similar methods. For workers though these city 
  soviets tended to be too slow to help tackle their pressing problems. The local 
  soviets and factory committees acted on their own account without approval from 
  above to get things done. Sometimes they merged at this local district level. 
  Here workers were able to conduct affairs, leaving the intellectuals to speech-making 
  in the city soviets. The local soviets took on economic, political and social 
  problems: food, housing, justice and culture all came within their orbit. They 
  guarded their local autonomy, but were prepared to unite -- from below -- and 
  an inter-district conference was held in Petrograd. This brought them into conflict 
  with the executive committee of the city Soviet. Similarly in Moscow, the local 
  soviets were much more radical than the Menshevik-run city Soviet.</p>
<p class="subtitle">
  The Peasants Take The Land</p>
<p>
  While the workers and soldiers were issuing demands for others to meet, and 
  slowly realizing that only they themselves could attain their ends, the peasants 
  were taking direct action. Peasant risings and land seizures were widespread. 
  The peasants carried out their own agrarian reform measures and ignored the 
  Provisional Government which was set against the seizure of land. Peasant committees 
  were formed at the village, volost, uezd (district) and guberniya (regional) 
  levels. Decisions tended to flow upwards: those coming down were only obeyed 
  if they were agreed with. The arguments within the Social Revolutionaries, the 
  peasant party, were no longer of real concern to the peasants. What mattered 
  to them was that the decisions they were taking and the regulations they were 
  adopting on the land issue should be irreversible.</p>
<p>
  The image of the peasants as a mass of ignorant anti-socialists, in a sea of 
  which Russia's workers would drown, is quite wrong. They set to running their 
  own affairs with enthusiasm: illiteracy was no bar to their abilities. The 45 
  elected members of the Peasant Committee of Novochastky uezd said they would 
  &quot;organize the new society&quot;. The Peasant Convention of Penza on May 
  15th was composed of illiterate peasants with a single literate teacher to take 
  down their resolutions. They called on owners &quot;to apply its decisions and 
  freely give their property to the (volost) land committee so as to avoid illegal 
  occupation by individual peasants' &quot; [15] The convention set out to control 
  rents, sort out the amounts of land each person or family unit could have, supervise 
  the harvests and ensure an efficient utilization of the land. The peasant assembly 
  of Samara showed the peasants' great impatience with the politicians over the 
  land question. A peasant shouted at a Menshevik &quot;We always have to wait, 
  you ass, don't play the fool with us.&quot; They paid scant regard to the 'legality' 
  of their actions -- &quot;That bunch of lawyers again,&quot; said one, &quot;saying 
  they're on our side, but we know different; they'll betray us.&quot; [16] Lenin's 
  Decree on Land could do no more than recognize a fait accompli: 65 out of 70 
  peasant soviets had already divided the land.</p>
<p>
  The peasants were quick to throw off the shackles of religion. A priest moaned: 
  &quot;My parishioners will nowadays only go to meetings of the soviet, and when 
  I remind them about the church, they tell me they have no time.&quot; [17] A 
  peasant told a priest straight to his face why: ''For centuries a few nobles 
  and landowners subjected millions of poor people, bled and sweated them -- and 
  you priests said it was right, chanting in chorus 'Long life to the Tsars and 
  our leaders&#8217;; yet, now that the people has power and is trying to establish 
  equality, you, the 'Holy men' will not recognize us.&quot; [18]</p>
<p>
  The workers knew the importance of the peasantry for the success of the revolution. 
  The Petrograd conference of factory committees debated the agrarian issue with 
  a view to sealing relations with the peasants. The Petrograd workers created 
  special commissions in the factories to gather scrap metals and damaged pieces 
  for a project they called 'Worker to Peasant', making agricultural tools for 
  the peasant committees. Delegates were sent into the countryside to negotiate 
  directly, worker to peasant, over grain deliveries. There is no reason to suppose 
  that workers and peasants could not have developed a workable relationship: 
  workers' self-management was no threat to the peasants.</p>

  The July Days</p>
<p>
  June saw strikes among the most exploited workers -- dyers, clerks, laundry 
  workers, and the unskilled. A combination of inflation, lock-outs and frustration 
  with the government and soviets was raising the temperature. A demonstration 
  on June 18th saw a striking slogan on a banner from one factory -- &quot;The 
  right to life is higher than the rights of Private Property&quot;. This stood 
  out amongst the morass of party slogans, which were basically 'Down with the 
  Government'. It was the workers who saw the issue in more fundamental terms. 
  With the Putilov works coming out on strike, the skilled metal workers were 
  now joining the movement. The Bolsheviks urged restraint. Lenin was moved to 
  say in 'Pravda' on June 21st: &quot;We understand your bitterness, we understand 
  the excitement of the Petersburg workers, but we say to them: Comrades, an immediate 
  attack would be inexpedient.&quot; Many rank-and-file worker Bolsheviks complained 
  at this, not liking having to play &quot;the part of the fire hose&quot;. At 
  a meeting at the Putilov works a Bolshevik said workers should wait for the 
  Party to state whether a demonstration was opportune or not, and got a sharp 
  reply: &quot;Again you want to postpone things. We can't live that way any longer 
  (...)&quot; [19] In weighing up the Bolshevik attitude, workers bore in mind 
  that the February strikes had been against the 'leaders' advice, and that action 
  from below had won the eight hour day.</p>
<p>
  In early July, the factories came out and the Red Guards were armed and ready. 
  On July 3rd, the Bolsheviks did all they could to hold back the machine-gun 
  regiments, and Tomsky complained at a Bolshevik conference &quot;The regiments 
  which have come out have acted in an uncomradely manner, not having invited 
  the Central Committee of our party to consider the question of a manifestation.&quot; 
  He urged the issue of an appeal to hold back 'the masses'. Lenin spoke to demonstrators 
  on the morning of the 4th, stressing the need for a peaceful march, to the amazement 
  of the armed sailors, who were looking for an endorsement of action. The march 
  was purely a working class affair, thousands pouring out of the poor districts 
  of Petrograd, with the demand &quot;All power to the soviets!&quot; But the 
  Soviet wasn't so keen: a worker had to shout at Chernov, one of the moderate 
  socialist leaders of the Soviet -- &quot;Take power, you stupid bastard, it's 
  being handed to you on a plate.&quot;</p>
<p>
  Instead of taking power, the Soviet leaders and their socialist allies in the 
  Provisional Government organized loyal troops to put down the advocates of such 
  a course! Some 400 workers and soldiers were killed to allow the moderate socialists 
  to appear respectable to the bourgeoisie. As the party untainted by this and 
  similar events, the Bolsheviks were bound to attract workers' support. Having 
  successfully reduced the July movement to a demonstration, the Bolsheviks got 
  on with 'organizing'. At the height of the July Days, Kamenev said &quot;Our 
  present task is to give the movement an organized character.&quot; Winning votes 
  and positions was the parallel of this approach. When the Bolsheviks won control 
  of the workers' section of the Petrograd Soviet, in Trotsky's estimation this 
  was on a par with achieving socialism itself: &quot;From the lips of the Bolshevik 
  orators the demonstrators learned of the victory just won in the workers' section, 
  and that fact gave them as palpable a satisfaction as would an entrance upon 
  the epoch of soviet power.&quot; [20]</p>
<p>
  Despite their restraining influence, the Bolsheviks found themselves subject 
  to repression at the hands of the socialists, who banned their papers and arrested 
  leading party militants where they could. The moderate socialists doubtless 
  believed their own propaganda, that it was 'agitators' that had stirred up trouble 
  in the workers. Their own failure to meet the people's demands was left out 
  of account. The theme of the repression was well expressed by the White General, 
  Kornilov, at the end of July: &quot;We need three armies -- in the trenches, 
  one in the factories or the rear, and one in the railways to link them (...) 
  all three must be as disciplined as the front-line one.&quot; Before long, Trotsky 
  would be saying the same thing. </p>
<p class="subtitle">
  Building Up To October</p>
<p>
  The repression after the abortive July Days was aimed primarily at the workers, 
  as capitalists and bourgeois politicians alike demanded an end to 'anarchy' 
  in the factories. There were attacks on the right of factory committees to meet 
  in working hours; the Committee of United Industrialists proposed that committee 
  members get no pay for time spent on committee business; some employers stopped 
  paying workers for the hours they were on militia duty; some refused to let 
  the factory committees meet on the firm's premises. Plants closed down, partly 
  because of the owners' deliberate policy, but also because of fuel and other 
  shortages as the country's railway system reached breaking-point. Orders were 
  turned down by bosses, lock-outs used, and some employers tried moving their 
  plant and machinery to less radical areas to start afresh. The Petrograd Manufacturers' 
  Association campaigned for piece-wages and 'open shops'. All this was part of 
  the attempt to suppress the committees and workers' control. The motto of the 
  bourgeois appeared to be: &quot;May the country perish if it no longer belongs 
  to me.&quot;</p>
<p>
  Some local soviets were forced to take over organizing the supply of goods and 
  essentials, as commerce collapsed. They did not find the socialists in the government 
  either helpful or sympathetic. Skobelev, the Menshevik Minister of Labor, who 
  had already put out a circular at the end of August that said that any meeting 
  in working hours was illegal, circulated a notice from industrialists in the 
  Urals which condemned &quot;any interference by the factory committees in the 
  management of an enterprise (...).&quot; In the face of the attacks made on 
  them, workers noted the ineffectiveness of the higher soviets and the trade 
  unions. Increasingly, they were having to look to themselves.</p>
<p>
  The most effective way to do this was through the factory committees. In August, 
  the second conference of the Factory Committees of Petrograd and its Environs 
  met. This did much to regularize the way the committees were organized. The 
  General Assembly of all the workers in a factory was the highest organ and the 
  backbone of the movement. From this was elected the factory committee. A General 
  Assembly could only be overruled by the Central Council of Factory Committees, 
  a body built up from all the factories. The General Assembly had the right to 
  recall and re-elect the committee at any time. For a factory committee to be 
  a valid one, 50% of the workforce had to vote. Sub-committees were to exist 
  for the different departments within a factory, or to carry out specific tasks. 
  &quot;The factory and shop committees are not created out of temporary meetings. 
  The masses elect to these committees those who at home in the everyday life 
  of the factory have demonstrated their firmness, their business-like character 
  and their devotion to the interests of the workers.'' [21] At this conference, 
  it was the Bolsheviks who again said that the job of the committees was to supervise, 
  not to initiate decisions; the anarchists defended the idea of self-management. 
  The Petrograd factory committees were faced with the problem of keeping production 
  going to stop the economy disintegrating: the owners' sabotage was forcing workers 
  to take over. Pressure was growing for seizing the factories, for enterprises 
  to be nationalized, for workers' control.</p>
<p>
  During August, workers responded with increasing effect to the bosses' July 
  offensive. As the vanguard of metal workers took a cautious attitude, new layers 
  of workers took up the battle. There was a one-day strike in Moscow on August 
  12th. An observer commented &quot;There were no lights, no tramcars; the factories 
  and shops were closed and the railroad yards and stations; even the waiters 
  in the restaurants had gone on strike.&quot; Some 400,000 were out. Other large 
  towns such as Kiev also had strikes. Moscow leather-workers also struck for 
  the right of their factory committees to hire and fire. In some places committees 
  took to arresting the managers. Although there was a revival of activity among 
  the soviets from the bottom up, the leading role of the committees was clear. 
  Even Lenin recognized that, briefly, in August: &quot;We must swing over the 
  centre of gravity to the factory and shop committees. (They) must become the 
  organs of insurrection.&quot; This rash of enthusiasm for the workers' organizations 
  did not last long. On August 31st, the Bolsheviks won a majority in the Petrograd 
  Soviet, and five days later took the Moscow Soviet. Now the call from Lenin 
  and Trotsky was &quot;All power to the Bolshevik soviets!&quot;</p>
<p>
  The Bolsheviks were also winning over some trade unions, who had always opposed 
  the factory committees. The centralized unions wanted the committees to supervise 
  affairs locally and nothing more; against this was the loose network of committees 
  who stood for collective management at the factory, city and national levels. 
  But the committees were getting organized nationally. On October 15th they published 
  their own journal 'Novy Put' ('New Path'). From the 17th-22nd October they held 
  the first All-Russian Conference of Factory Committees with 137 representatives 
  from 49 industrial centers, 66 of the delegates being Bolshevik. The conference 
  voted to set up an All-Russian Council, and discussed the problems of the Central 
  Council of Factory Committees. As local committees had kept their best activists, 
  the resulting vacancies were being filled by representatives from Soviets, trade 
  unions and political parties. The conference stated that &quot;The workers are 
  more interested than the owners in the correct and uninterrupted operation of 
  the plants.&quot; Workers' control was &quot;in the interest of the whole country 
  and ought to be supported by the revolutionary peasantry and the revolutionary 
  army.&quot; The Bolshevik Milyutin argued that a soviet take-over was needed 
  for workers' control. His comrade, Larin, touched on a theme that was to become 
  a favorite of Lenin&#8217;s: &quot;Germany has set up a national economic program, 
  but it has been conceived in the interests of the ruling class: we must do the 
  same, only in the workers' interest.&quot; An anarchist, Pistrkovsky, attacked 
  the unions : &quot;the unions are trying to throttle us (...) their members 
  are not actually in the factory (...) they are always ready to compromise (...) 
  the committees hold the key to the future.&quot;</p>
<p>
  The trade unions were in the main Menshevik controlled and against the October 
  Revolution. The factory committees on the other hand called for the soviets 
  to take power. During October, power was more and more shifting into the hands 
  of the workers, soldiers and peasants. Printing workers took action to stop 
  any counterrevolutionary propaganda; arsenal workers and clerical employees 
  controlled the release of arms and ammunition; the Petrograd lighting station 
  factory committee liaised with other committees to get coal and grease for turbines 
  to get round the employers' sabotage; a conference of artillery factory workers 
  called for a soviet government, and set up a group to study the transition to 
  peaceful production.</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, Lenin was writing on the evening of October 24th -- &quot;Who is 
  to seize the power? That is now of no importance. Let the Military Revolutionary 
  Committee take it, or 'some other institution', which will declare that it will 
  surrender the power only to the genuine representatives of the interests of 
  the people.'' [22] Not 'the people', not even 'representatives of the people', 
  but 'representatives of the interests of the people': that is, the Bolshevik 
  Party led by Lenin. Lenin's program for revolution adopted the demands of the 
  mass movement -- replace the existing government with a soviet system, end the 
  war, give the land to the peasants, establish workers' control -- only to dilute 
  the demands and hold back the movement. Workers' control, for instance, was 
  to be nothing more than &quot;a national, all-embracing, omnipresent, most exact 
  and most conscientious accounting of production and distribution of goods,&quot; 
  and the existing state machinery would be taken over for this. [23]</p>
<p class="subtitle">
  Soldiers, Militias &amp; Red Guards</p>
<p>
  When the soldiers heard the news of the February Revolution &quot;All the soldiers 
  said, 'Thank God! Maybe now we will have Peace'.&quot;, as a delegate to a conference 
  of soviets in March reported. As army discipline collapsed, the soldiers' demands 
  were for dignity and respect, to be treated as humans, not insulted by their 
  officers or addressed in the familiar form reserved for pets and children, not 
  to have to salute, and for the same political and civil rights as any private 
  citizen. Above all, they wanted an end to the war. They elected soldiers' committees 
  which controlled arms, and sent representatives to soviets. One million soldiers 
  simply deserted the front to get back home and take their share of the land. 
  After April, the soldiers started to back the workers; some took part in the 
  July Days. After that, attempts were made by the authorities to restore discipline 
  in the army. However, the soldiers' distrust of their officers had gone too 
  far by then. As the future creator of the Red Army -- and future employer of 
  Tsarist officers -- noted: &quot;The workers on the other hand, along with the 
  'dark' rank-and-file, saw every possible danger exactly in the ranks of those 
  brilliant officers.&quot; The soldiers' committees started to demand land for 
  the peasants, the abolition of private property, the setting up of workers' 
  militias, and workers' control. Bolshevik popularity increased amongst them 
  because the soldiers thought they too wanted peace.</p>
<p>
  In the early days of the revolution, in February and March, 30,000 revolvers 
  and 40,000 rifles disappeared from military stores, and many found their way 
  into the hands of workers. The first workers' militias were started by printers. 
  Usually set up by non-party workers in some secrecy, they were intended to defend 
  the factories. The Workers' Guards in the plants gave factory committees the 
  power to enforce their decisions on reluctant employers and managers. Red Guards 
  also acted to prevent sabotage by the bosses and their agents. When attempts 
  were made after the July Days to disarm workers, they surrendered useless rubbish 
  and kept the worthwhile weapons. After the abortive Kornilov coup, workers kept 
  rifles constantly by their side at work. Working women set up Red Cross divisions 
  in the plants and lectures were arranged on the care of the wounded. Factory 
  committees gradually got material together for makeshift hospitals and ambulances. 
  The Vyborg factory committees had their own military-revolutionary committee. 
  This set up patrols of the district, got keys for all the drawbridges' and studied 
  the weak points in the districts defense.</p>
<p>
  The arming of the workers was too extensive for the authorities to do anything 
  about it. At the time of Kornilov's attempted coup, they had to rely on the 
  workers. Railwaymen tore up tracks to stop Kornilov's men, and armed themselves; 
  postal clerks held up communications; soviets in large stations misdirected 
  trains and regiments. The pressure from below rebuilt local soviets to face 
  the reactionaries. The workers' militias and Red Guards were close to the factory 
  committees and local soviets. Service in them was worked out by lots, so that 
  all workers spent at least some time in them. Factories worked extra hours to 
  produce arms and ammunition. While those with arms drilled in the handling of 
  weapons, the unarmed learned other useful military skills such as building fortifications. 
  The 40,000 strong Red Guards kept order in the working class districts, stopping 
  theft, protecting strikers and demonstrators, supporting and defending the factory 
  committees physically.</p>
<p class="subtitle">
  October 1917</p>
<p>
  The insurrection that gave power to the Bolsheviks was strictly speaking the 
  work of the Military-Revolutionary Committee of the Petrograd Soviet. Although 
  only small numbers were actively involved initially, the total lack of opposition 
  to them, the absence of support for the Provisional Government meant they could 
  not be described as a minority. Support for the action came rushing in after 
  the event from the Soviet of Petrograd Trade Unions and the All-Russian Soviet 
  of Factory Committees amongst others. The factory committees rallied to the 
  Bolsheviks because the latter appeared to support the workers' aspirations. 
  The committees had been active in the July Days, had helped organize armed guards, 
  and were involved In the Military-Revolutionary Committee. Skrypnik, a Bolshevik 
  on the Central Council of Factory Committees had told the party's Central Committee 
  that the workers were ready for a revolution, and if there wasn't one soon, 
  the committees would swing to the anarcho-syndicalists. Mass meetings in Petrograd 
  called for the Second All-Russian Congress of Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies 
  to form a government. This was a clear ratification of the seizure of power. 
  If October was 'easy', it was because all the work had been done beforehand. 
  The Provisional Government was utterly discredited, and Bolshevism's reactionary 
  aspect had not been revealed.</p>
<p>
  Despite the mass of workers and soldiers thronging the Soviet Congress on October 
  25th, the presidium was elected on the basis of 14 Bolsheviks, 7 Social-Revolutionaries, 
  three Mensheviks and one Internationalist. The Bolsheviks then trooped out their 
  worker-candidates Lenin, Trotsky, Kamenev, Zinoviev and so on. When it came 
  to forming a government, Kamenev read out a Bolshevik Central Committee proposal 
  for a Soviet of People's Commissars, whereby &quot;control over the activities 
  of the government is vested in the Congress of Soviets and its Central Executive 
  Committee&quot;. Seven Bolsheviks from the party's central committee were nominated, 
  and thus Lenin and Trotsky came to sit at the top, never having done a day's 
  work in their lives. The &quot;workers' government&quot; was now composed of 
  middle-class professional revolutionaries.</p>
<p>
  The Bolshevik party leadership at that time was composed of well-educated militants, 
  generally in their mid-thirties on average. Most had some personal means, and 
  thus no need to work, either sustained by family wealth or party funds. Some 
  took jobs to 'get into industry' (an updating of the old Narodnik idea of going 
  to the people: this is still much copied by today's imitation Bolsheviks). In 
  their origins, the Bolsheviks ranged from the aristocratic, like Chicherin, 
  to the bureaucratic, like Lenin and Kollontai, via the landed bourgeois (Smilga), 
  the commercial bourgeois (Yoffe) and the higher industrial bourgeois (Pyatakov). 
  These were the sort of people used to being a ruling class.</p>
<p>
  It was the Red Guard who peremptorily closed clown the Constituent Assembly, 
  the Western-style parliament. While the Assembly members and the socialists 
  (including some Bolsheviks) were shocked, the population as a whole was completely 
  indifferent to the end of another talking-shop. The Red Guardist Trifonov had 
  wanted to turn the Red Guard into a militia under the control of the factory 
  committees that all workers would pass through. But after October the Bolsheviks 
  did not trust the Red Guard, as it was an armed force independent of the party, 
  and Lenin said that &quot;the place for the best workers is the factory.&quot; 
  The workers in general used the Bolshevik slogans, except the call for nationalization, 
  where workers were for control by the factory committees. Even at the moment 
  of revolution, when the Bolsheviks were able to ride the waves, the conflict 
  between them and the workers was there in potential. In some other ways the 
  workers went further than the Bolsheviks. It was workers who were insistent 
  on the closure of all bourgeois papers, and compulsory labor or expulsion for 
  the bourgeois. But the party won the day: in 1916 the constitution of the new 
  state was ratified with the words &quot;the party leads and dominates the entire 
  apparatus of state.&quot; The workers, for all their efforts, remained workers.</p>
<p class="subtitle">
  The Practical Manual &amp; The Counter-Manual</p>
<p>
  In his pamphlet 'State &amp; Revolution' written before October, but not published 
  till 1918, Lenin had called for 'every cook to govern', for workers to plan 
  the socialist society. The militant activists in the factory committees were 
  aware of the need to co-ordinate their activities and centralize. The very day 
  after the October Revolution, representatives from the Central Council of Factory 
  Committees met Lenin and some Trade Union leaders to propose a Provisional All-Russian 
  People's Economic Council. Here was a genuine plan from elements of the real 
  working class vanguard. They suggested that this Council should have as two-thirds 
  of its members, workers' representatives from the factory committees, trade 
  unions and the Soviet's Central Executive Committee, and one-third drawn from 
  the owners and technicians. The Council would have separate divisions corresponding 
  to different parts of the economy, each division to be overseen by control commissions 
  composed only of workers, these forming a control commission over the whole 
  Council. The Council would regulate industry, transport and agriculture, and 
  would be able to take over private firms. This constructive attempt to grapple 
  with the problems of the economy, thought out by those most affected, was turned 
  down flat by Lenin, who had his own &quot;workers' plan&quot; In the form of 
  a draft decree which accepted economic conditions and relations that the factory 
  committees were trying to go beyond. His decree in effect intended the committees 
  to be subordinate to the unions. Lenin also refused to let the committees borrow 
  money: the effect of this is looked at further on. On day one of Bolshevik rule, 
  the workers' own plan was rejected.</p>
<p>
  Undeterred, the Central Council tried another plan on November 3rd, this time 
  to set up an All-Russian Council for the Regulation of Industry. This plan differed 
  from the earlier one: it excluded the unions, whose leaders had stood with Lenin. 
  The Central Council's leaders saw that the unions were too remote from the workers, 
  that they were unable to counteract the employers' attempts to sabotage factories. 
  Similarly, the plan now left employers out of consideration and tried to ensure 
  that the factory committees could not be integrated into the state. The Central 
  Council was already drawing well away from Lenin's conceptions, and moving rapidly 
  to the realization that the workers alone had to run industry, Lenin's ideas 
  were standing still: &quot;It was assumed without question that the employers 
  and technical staffs would continue to operate their enterprises under the vigilant 
  eye of 'workers' control'.&quot; [24] In late October a Bolshevik trade union 
  spokesman, Lozovsky, said &quot;It is necessary to make an absolutely clear 
  and categorical reservation that the workers in each enterprise should not get 
  the impression that the enterprise belongs to them.&quot; [25] However for the 
  workers, the revolution meant that the productive forces of the country were 
  now theirs.</p>
<p>
  The draft decree on Workers' Control published in November set up an All-Russian 
  Soviet for Workers' Control. However this only had five representatives from 
  the factory committees, who thus became a tiny minority. Workers' control was 
  to be carried out by elected bodies, either factory committees alongside management 
  or general assemblies of all workers: these bodies would have access to the 
  firm's accounts and other information (which a lot of factory committees already 
  had), and their decisions would be binding. There were, though, two enormous 
  'buts' in the proposals. Firstly, the trade unions centrally could overrule 
  any factory committee decisions, and secondly, in any enterprise &quot;important 
  to the state&quot;, the committees were answerable to state bodies for keeping 
  order and doing as instructed. These two things negated any positive aspects 
  of the decree. More detailed instructions to supplement the decree were drawn 
  up by a small committee of three Bolsheviks and two left Social-Revolutionaries: 
  'every cook to govern' indeed! Eventually the new government produced its &quot;General 
  Instructions on Workers' Control&quot;, which came to be known as the &quot;Counter-Manual&quot;. 
  Its overall intention was to turn the factory committees into powerless local 
  union branches. Its standpoint is captured in Article 7: &quot;(...) the right 
  to issue orders relating to the management, running and functioning of enterprises 
  remains in the hands of the owners.&quot;</p>
<p>
  The Central Council of Factory Committees distributed a &quot;Practical Manual 
  for the Implementation of Workers' Control&quot; in late November 1917. This 
  advocated that each factory should have commissions to organize production, 
  to handle the conversion of production from war to peace, to get supplies of 
  fuel and raw materials and so on. Such commissions would in all probability 
  use the knowledge and abilities of technicians and specialists, but these would 
  have no power of decision at all; this was in marked contrast to Lenin's schema. 
  The factory committees should unite upwards: in local, regional and national 
  federations, thus posing a direct challenge to the Bolshevik state. Then the 
  Central Council drew up a Model Statute for factory committees as a direct response 
  to the Bolsheviks' &quot;Counter-Manual&quot; and draft instructions. This envisaged 
  that the committees would be integrated into an economic council system, with 
  People's Economic Councils in every district, city and region. These councils 
  would be elected at conferences of factory committees, and their members would 
  all have to be from a factory committee.</p>
<p>
  This plan was fully developed and drawn up in December. The local councils would 
  unite the factory committees, transport workers and those in commerce and agriculture. 
  The regional councils would each year elect a Supreme Economic Council. Each 
  People's Economic Council would deal with all the economic activity in its locality. 
  This flood of ideas and plans from the workers in the factories showed that 
  the workers knew that socialism would be empty and meaningless if it was anything 
  other than their own activity. They were trying concretely to tackle the massive 
  problems facing Russia; so too were the Bolsheviks, but from a different class 
  viewpoint. A much modified version of the Economic Councils idea was introduced 
  in such a way as to weaken the factory committees by gradually establishing 
  a centralized top-down control and strangling local initiative.</p>
<p>
  The majority of factory committees approved of the Central Council's proposals 
  and rejected the Bolshevik All-Russian Council of Workers' Control. Factory 
  committees in the metal industry complained that the 'Counter-Manual' &quot;shackled 
  the hands of the workers&quot; while the 'Practical Manual' &quot;allowed the 
  workers great room for self-activity and made them the practical rulers of the 
  factories.&quot; [26] In the period following the October Revolution, greatly 
  increased factory committee activity was necessary to face the employers' tactics 
  of sabotage, closures and refusal to pay wages. Hundreds of firms were taken 
  over by workers who had no alternative if they were to protect their livelihood. 
  The Bolshevik government and the trade unions were against such seizures by 
  workers: incredibly, the Supreme Economic Council threatened to cut off funds 
  to such firms. Many such workplaces were managed by collegial boards of workers, 
  technicians and administrators, all under the watchful eye of the factory committee. 
  By mid-1918, factory committees were involved In the management boards of some 
  three-fifths of all plants, and in areas such as the Urals and the Donetz basin 
  it was more.</p>
<p>
  The committees were facing enormous difficulties in a period of economic collapse 
  that was not of the workers' making. The committees made any number of constructive 
  efforts to overcome the chaos. The Central Council of Petrograd committees co-coordinated 
  work to organize deliveries of drugs, yarn, machine oil etc to the provinces 
  and Finland. Just before the October Revolution, the first All-Russian Conference 
  of Factory Committees had called for a plan to change wartime production over 
  to peacetime purposes: the Central Council set up demobilization commissions 
  to do this. Politically, the committees were clarifying their attitudes. A Bolshevik 
  worker, Matvei Zhivkov, who was chairman of the factory committee at the 1886 
  power station in Petrograd, said: &quot;(...) it is where we are, in the factory 
  committees, that instructions are elaborated which arise from below to envelop 
  all branches of industry; these are the instructions of the workplace, of life, 
  and hence are the only instructions which can have any value. They show what 
  the factory committees are capable of, and, therefore, they should dominate 
  everything which concerns workers' control.&quot; [27]</p>
<p class="subtitle">
  Disciplining The Workers</p>
<p>
  Trade union Bolsheviks begged to differ, and the verbal attacks on the workers 
  started. For Tomsky, &quot;productivity has fallen so low that workers are producing 
  less in value than they get as a wage.&quot; Gostiev referred to &quot;economic 
  sabotage, no longer solely by the bourgeoisie, (...) but by the whole nation, 
  the working class.&quot; [28] Shlyapnikov, the Commissar of Labor and future 
  leader of the so-called &quot;Workers' Opposition&quot;, complained about the 
  workers and the factory committees in March 1918: &quot;In a word, things are 
  in the hands of a crowd that, due to its ignorance and lack of interest in production, 
  is literally putting a brake on all work.&quot; [29]In the face of these sorts 
  of comments and the withholding of wages by banks and employers, it's no wonder 
  that many workers felt -- why work when the Bolsheviks keep the old owners in 
  place and defend the profit motive? Despite the accusations, productivity rose 
  steadily in fact from the low point of January 1918. The workers were still 
  aiming to build a new society, and a miserable diet wasn't going to stop them. 
  Given the chaos they operated in, it is hardly surprising if many factory committees 
  put their own interests first and concentrated on trying to resolve their particular 
  problems. Accusations were then made that the committees were 'parochial' and 
  'particularistic'. The accusers were themselves responsible for these tendencies, 
  as the government would not let the committees obtain credit early on: as a 
  result, committees often had to sell machinery and stock to pay workers and 
  to keep any production going at all.</p>
<p>
  The decree on nationalization made on December 14th 1917 was part of the move 
  against self-management. New boards were to take over firms, and the old management 
  and the factory committee would be represented on them. While workers who called 
  for nationalization, often expropriating the owners before getting 'official' 
  approval, thought they would run the firms, the Bolshevik conception was quite 
  different: indeed, the Bolsheviks were often reluctant nationalizes. Once nationalized 
  though &quot;(...) decisions concerning management and the activity of the industry 
  belong to management. The control commission (of the factory committee) will 
  not take any part in this management, and will not be responsible for its functioning, 
  which remains a managerial matter.&quot; [30] In the Urals most firms were taken 
  over by workers and nationalized. </p>
<p>
  A conference in Petrograd on January 7th 1918 of delegates from 300,000 workers 
  laid out a scheme for a nationalized mining industry. Every mine would elect 
  a managing council of 25-60 members, including representatives of technical 
  and administrative staff: this would set up an executive of 3-15. There would 
  be direct elections to regional bodies leading up to a Central Mining Council. 
  The right of recall by workers who elected a delegate to any council at whatever 
  level was spelt out clearly, and trade union and state bodies were excluded. 
  Again we can see the constructive attempts of workers to develop practical structures 
  that gave them control, as against the government's plans. In their attitude 
  to the technical staffs, workers were not usually hostile, even though the technicians 
  wanted a strong state control to guarantee their position and were against workers' 
  control. Many though were willing to work with the committees, who needed to 
  make use of their abilities.</p>
<p>
  The trade unions saw as their major task increasing production through more 
  organized and disciplined labor. They were eager to help set piece-rates, norms 
  and bonuses, to raise productivity and impose discipline. In this they were 
  supporting Lenin. In September 1917 he called for &quot;universal labor service&quot; 
  (presumably not so universal as to include himself and other top Bolsheviks); 
  in January 1918 in an unpublished article he wrote that &quot;workers who slack 
  at their work&quot; should be &quot;put in prison&quot;. For Lenin only &quot;the 
  declassed petty bourgeois intelligentsia (...) does not understand that the 
  chief difficulty for socialism consists in guaranteeing the discipline of labor 
  (...)&#8221;: socialism's 'chief difficulty' thus appears to be the same as 
  capitalism&#8217;s! Lenin's solution was the same as capitalism&#8217;s:</p>
<p>
  &quot;Piece-rates must be put on the agenda, applied in practice and tried out; 
  we must apply much that is scientific and progressive in the Taylor system (...)'' 
  [31] Lenin, not the workers, decides what is put 'on the agenda', but the workers, 
  not Lenin, will try out the piece-rates.</p>
<p>
  This attitude was reflected at the 1st All-Russian Trade Union Congress held 
  in January 1918. The factory committees were attacked for not being organized, 
  or disciplined or experienced enough. Members of the Central Council of Factory 
  Committees were not there to argue their case. The Bolshevik Gastev proposed 
  a resolution that was passed almost unanimously which argued for the industrial 
  reconstruction of Russia with foreign capital, for the implementation of Taylorism 
  (piece-rates, time and motion studies etc), for the raising of productivity 
  and discipline, for workers to be moved as required, and for private ownership 
  to remain. This approach was agreed in March at the 4th Conference of Trade 
  Unions.</p>
<p>
  The Bolsheviks proceeded to Bolshevize the non-Bolshevik trade unions by breaking 
  up meetings, setting up rival unions and appointing officials from above, so 
  that all unions would adopt Gastev's capitalist approach. Protests from workers 
  about the lack of independence from the state of the unions grew in the spring 
  of 1918. The factory committees still tried to be constructive. While answering 
  the slanderous attacks made on them by the unions, the committees proposed unity 
  with the trade unions, so as not to have two workers' organizations in conflict. 
  The proposal had conditions attached: there should be compulsory membership 
  so that all workers would be part of the decision-making process; the factory 
  committees would act as local branches; the summit of the union would be a conference 
  of factory committee delegates, which would then elect an executive to act like 
  the Central Council of Factory Committees.</p>
<p>
  The Petrograd factory committees had been far in advance of anyone else in thinking 
  of the centralized economy in August 19179 and had come up with plan after plan, 
  all of them practical propositions, for workers to run the economy and move 
  to socialism. Given the way Lenin ignored these attempts, it was a real nerve 
  of him to say to the 3rd Congress of Soviets in January 1918: &quot;In introducing 
  workers' control, we knew that it would take much time before it spread to the 
  whole of Russia, but we wanted to show that we recognize only one road -- changes 
  from below; we wanted the workers themselves, from below, to draw up the new 
  basic economic principles...&quot; In fact Lenin's state capitalism with a decorative 
  bit of workers' control added was behind the workers' struggle. Workers had 
  their own plans and a superior conception of socialism born of necessity: stripped 
  bare of rhetoric, all Lenin had was 'Power to the Party'.</p>
<p>
  It did not take long for Lenin to state clearly the capitalist content of his 
  socialism. In March 1918, he demanded 'one-man management' on the railways: 
  for him, collective self-management was rudimentary, and had to be superseded 
  by one-man management. In 'The Current Tasks of the Soviet Power', Lenin wrote 
  &quot;Any large-scale machine industry -- and this is precisely the material 
  productive source and basis of socialism -- calls for unconditional and strict 
  unity of the will which directs the simultaneous work of hundreds and thousands 
  and tens of thousands of people (...) Unqualified submission to a single will 
  is conditionally necessary for the success of the process of labor organized 
  on the pattern of large-scale machine industry.&quot; [32] Why workers should 
  bother to fight and die for this is not explained, </p>
<p>
  In 1915 the then Menshevik Larin wrote an article enthusing over the German 
  war-state: &quot;Contemporary Germany has given the world a pattern of the centralized 
  direction of the national economy as a single machine working according to plan.&quot; 
  Lenin took up this theme with his observation that socialism had been realized 
  politically in Russia and economically in Germany. By April 1918, Lenin exhorted 
  &quot;Yes, learn from the German! History proceeds by zigzags and crooked paths. 
  It happens that it is the German who now, side by side with bestial imperialism, 
  embodies the principles of discipline, of organization, of solid working together, 
  on the basis of the most modern machine industry, of strict accounting and control.&quot; 
  That all this labor discipline might have anything to do with the 'bestial imperialism' 
  did not enter Lenin's mind: for him, the only thing wrong with German state 
  capitalism was that it was a bourgeois-imperialist state; add a 'proletarian 
  state' and you have socialism. Capitalist methods of production can only create 
  capitalism, but Lenin thought they could support 'socialism' too. To make his 
  point firmly, Lenin referred admiringly to a Tsar. Russian socialists had to 
  &quot;study the state capitalism of the Germans, (...) adopt it with all possible 
  strength, not to spare dictatorial methods in order to hasten its adoption even 
  more than Peter hastened the adoption of Westernism by barbarous Russia, not 
  shrinking from barbarous weapons to fight barbarism.&quot; For the workers this 
  meant more work and harder work, and more organization (by others).</p>
<p>
  The 7th Party Congress in March 1918 demanded &quot;the most energetic, unsparingly 
  decisive, draconian measures to raise the self-discipline and discipline of 
  workers and peasants.&quot; Milyutin, in a session of Vesenkha (the Supreme 
  Council of National Economy), called for a 'labor service' not of course &quot;the 
  kind of labor service which has been applied in the west, not the kind of service 
  which is thought of here by the masses and which says that all must be put to 
  work, but labor service as a system of labor discipline and as a system of the 
  organization of labor in the interests of production.&quot; Not in the interests 
  of workers, evidently: this all required &quot;iron self-discipline&quot; on 
  the part of workers. Vesenkha had underneath it a network of glavki (chief committees) 
  and tsentry (centers). These were based on the Tsarist war committees for industry, 
  and operated with help from managements. Larin, the admirer of German capitalism, 
  and Milyutin were two of the leaders of Vesenkha, both of them enthusiastic 
  planners. At the end of April, a Vesenkha decree outlawed 'wildcat nationalizations', 
  but this, like an earlier decree in February was widely ignored. The factory 
  committees did not respond to Vesenkha's 'authority': for its part, the Central 
  Council of Factory Committees operated without any official sanction.</p>
<p class="subtitle">
  The Bolshevik Bosses</p>
<p>
  In May 1918, when the All-Russian Congress of Councils of National Economy met 
  in Moscow there were delegates from Vesenkha, its glavki and tsentry, and the 
  trade unions, but not the factory committees. The door was shutting firmly on 
  the workers, as the committees became mere local branches of a top-heavy union 
  bureaucracy. The unions were subordinate to the state, as agreed at the first 
  All-Russian Congress of Trade Unions. (One anarchist delegate described the 
  unions as &quot;living corpses&quot;; another said that the factory committees 
  were &quot;cells of the coming socialist social order, the order without political 
  power.&quot;) A decree on June 28th 1918 nationalized all major industry, making 
  the state the main employer in Russia; labor was to be a form of service to 
  society, and piece-rates were regarded as normal. [33] As the invasions by Allied 
  Powers and the civil war had only just started, none of what had happened thus 
  far can be blamed on those factors. The application of piece-rates and norms 
  of production meant that workers were driving themselves to ill-health to get 
  a survival wage. Yet at the end of the year, norms were raised throughout industry 
  because the state machine considered wages to be &quot;perniciously high&quot;. 
  In January 1919, the norms were raised by 150% in the metal industry.</p>
<p>
  These developments started to cause dissent within the Bolshevik party, even 
  amongst those who had never worked in their life. 'Kommunist' the journal of 
  the 'Left Communists' contained an attack on Lenin by Osinsky. Among other criticisms, 
  Osinsky argued that Lenin's 'discipline' was exactly like that of the capitalists; 
  that only the workers can emancipate themselves; that Lenin confused productivity 
  improvements with working harder and faster, &quot;Socialism and the socialist 
  organization of work will either be built by the proletariat itself, or it will 
  not be built at all; but then something else will be erected, namely state capitalism.&quot; 
  [34] Lenin replied, as he always did when lost for an answer, with a tirade 
  of abuse and nonsense: for instance, statements that the introduction of capitalist 
  authority and labor discipline were an attack on workers' self-organization 
  were &quot;a terrible disgrace and imply the complete renunciation of communism 
  in practice and complete desertion to the camp of the petty bourgeoisie.&quot;</p>
<p>
  Workers were able to impose themselves occasionally against the growing monolith 
  of Bolshevik state power. During 1918 state-capitalist combines had been set 
  up in the leather, textile and sugar industries based on co-operation between 
  the state and the old owners. The right-wing industrialist Mescherskii wanted 
  to create a similar 'trust' in the metal industry, with the factories run by 
  the old bourgeois owners. This was alright by Lenin and Trotsky, and officials 
  of the Metalworkers Union supported the project. Workers were however very much 
  against it. A conference of delegates from affected plants demanded an end to 
  the scheme, and immediate nationalization. As the Bolsheviks were not yet strong 
  enough to crush this sort of thing, the pressure from below put an end to the 
  project.</p>
<p>
  The civil war undoubtedly strengthened tendencies to central control and planning, 
  involving one-man management and the use of highly-paid technical specialists. 
  Centralization of itself is not a bad thing: the question is, who's doing the 
  centralizing, and to what end? Again, using the talents of technical staffs 
  was essential, but to what end would their abilities be directed? The peasants 
  were angry that the old exploiters were taken on as managers of the Sovkhozy 
  collective farms. The 'specialists' got high salaries, and the managers and 
  directors lived in the luxury of the old landowners' houses: sometimes the old 
  landowner himself was the director. Lenin's message to the peasants was &quot;(...) 
  if you yourselves do not know how to organize agriculture in the new way, we 
  must take the old specialists into our service.&quot; While the Lenin of 'State 
  and Revolution' said &quot;Smash the bourgeois state&quot;, the Lenin of 'Will 
  the Bolsheviks retain state power?' said &quot;Use the bourgeois state, take 
  it over.&quot; Thus Trotsky drew heavily on the Tsarist officer corps for the 
  Red Army.</p>
<p>
  When Molotov analyzed the personnel of the glavki he found that 57% were definitely 
  non-worker; the other 43% included representatives of the unions, mostly not 
  workers either. He concluded in his report (given in December 1918) that those 
  directing policy were &quot;employers' representatives, technicians and specialists.&quot; 
  A 'white' professor reported in autumn 1919 that &quot;the unprepared visitor 
  to these centers and glavki who is personally acquainted with the former commercial 
  and industrial world will be surprised to see the former owners of big leather 
  factories sitting in Glavkozh, big manufacturers in the central textile organization, 
  etc.&quot; [35] The willingness to use the Tsarist state machinery extended 
  to a Sovnarkom (Council of People's Commissars) decree in January 1920 regretting 
  that &quot;the old police apparatus which had known how to register citizens 
  not only in the towns, but in the country&quot; had been destroyed by the revolution. 
  </p>
<p>
  Despite this destructive act by the revolution, the mobility of labor was still 
  achieved. A spokesman from Narkomtrud (the People's Commissariat of Labor) boasted: 
  &quot;We supplied labor according to plan and consequently without taking account 
  of individual peculiarities or qualifications or of the wish of the worker to 
  engage in this or that kind of work.&quot; He could have been talking about 
  any commodity. The governments wages policy was based on incentives and piece-work; 
  wages were in groups of scales, the highest by far being for technical and administrative 
  people. At the 8th Party Congress in March 1919, the new program declared that 
  &quot;(...) the socialist method of production can be made secure only on the 
  basis of the comradely discipline of the workers.&quot; To the unions fell the 
  task of creating this new 'socialist discipline'. Disciplinary courts of labor 
  in 1920 dealt with 945 recorded cases. About half of these cases related to 
  punctuality; others were about not doing Saturday overtime, not obeying orders 
  or union discipline, leaving work and agitating for a shorter working day. The 
  9th Party Congress in March 1920 not only fully accepted the principle of one-man 
  management, but even came up with four different ways of instituting it.</p>
<p>
  The utter feebleness of the emerging 'opposition' inside the Bolshevik party 
  was shown by Lutovinov of the &quot;Workers' Opposition&quot; saying they'd 
  carry out one-man management while disagreeing with it. First the party, and 
  a poor last, the workers. By November 1920 only 12% of nationalized industries 
  had any form of collective management. 1783 out of 2051 large enterprises under 
  Vesenkha had one-man management. To overcome absenteeism and 'inefficiency' 
  the government had introduced labor books for workers in Moscow and Petrograd 
  (up till then they had only been issued to the old bourgeoisie for compulsory 
  labor). 'Communist Saturdays' -- that is, working for nothing -- were instituted 
  with Lenin's enthusiastic approval. The massive drive for unpaid overtime, with 
  Subbotniks working Saturday unpaid, and Voskresniks working Sunday unpaid, eventually 
  collapsed. Workers were (quite inexplicably!) not too excited. Lenin did try 
  to set an example: he actually worked a 'Communist Saturday' on May 1st 1920.</p>
<p>
  Latter-day Bolshevism's other favorite, Trotsky, deserves to say a few words 
  at this point. In January 1919 at a Trade Union Congress, he stressed that &quot;At 
  a time when the Trade Unions regulate wages and conditions of work, when the 
  appointment of the Commissar for Labor also depends on our Congress, no strikes 
  can take place in Soviet Russia. Let us put the dot on this i.&quot; Having 
  dotted that i, he proceeded to cross the t in the following year, recognizing 
  &quot;the right of the workers' state to send each working man and woman to 
  the place where they are needed for the fulfillment of economic tasks&quot;; 
  and &quot;the right of the state, the workers' state, to punish the working 
  man or woman who refuses to carry out the order of the state, who does not subordinate 
  his will to the will of the working class and to its economic tasks (...)&quot; 
  Stripped of verbiage and rhetoric, Trotsky's message to workers was 'We, the 
  Bolsheviks, are the bosses now; you, the workers -- back to work !' Trotsky's 
  call for a 'militarization of labor' &quot;in which every worker feels himself 
  a soldier of labor, who cannot dispose of himself freely&quot; was taken up 
  by the party Central Committee, who only debated whether it should take a 'healthy' 
  or a 'bureaucratic' form.</p>
<p class="subtitle">
  The Revolution Defeated</p>
<p>
  In the debates over the role of the trade unions in a so-called 'workers' state' 
  the party was talking to itself. The class lines had already been drawn with 
  the emasculation of the factory committees and the soviets. On one side stood 
  Lenin, the bureaucrats and state capitalism; on the other were the workers (both 
  Bolshevik and non-party) and socialism. As Lenin took away the factories he 
  gave the workers -- the right to strike ! As if the revolution had been all 
  for that. The crushing of the Kronstadt revolt in March 1921 consummated the 
  counter-revolution in the open. For workers, Trotsky was not the Red Army hero 
  but the bloody executioner of the Kronstadt soldiers and sailors. The end of 
  the civil war in late 1920 and the introduction of the NEP (New Economic Policy, 
  called the 'New Exploitation of the Proletariat' by the Workers' Opposition) 
  led to unemployment. As industries were reorganized and rationalized, workers 
  got the sack. The growing famine in the countryside kept these workers in the 
  towns and cities: their dire poverty meant the state could now direct them without 
  coercion. In September 1921 a decree declared that the wage system was &quot;a 
  fundamental factor in the development of industry&quot;, and further, that &quot;any 
  thought of egalitarianism must be excluded&quot;. Even to think of socialism 
  was now out of the question. At the 5th All-Russian Congress of Trade Unions 
  in September 1922 the bureaucrats rubbed in their victory. It was decided that 
  if a worker failed to reach the set norm, their wage would be knocked down by 
  a third, and that workers could be sacked without any compensation if they did 
  not fulfill their contracts. Despite all this, there were wildcat strikes against 
  managements and unions as late as July and August 1923.</p>
<p>
  In the, mid-1920s, workers were cheated by the 'NEP man' and the bureaucrat, 
  paying high prices and getting low wages. The managers and the state employer 
  drove them hard; they had no say at all in running the factories. The local 
  trade union branch and the party cell were in with management, while the unemployed 
  waiting outside kept workers at their places, keeping wages down and conditions 
  bad. The party 'oppositions' appealed to the workers but were ignored by them. 
  &quot;The workers seemed to say by their silence: it is all very well but what 
  does it mean to us?&quot; [36] From the workers' point of view, what did the 
  'struggle' within the Party mean to them ? It wasn't a question of 'correct' 
  slogans or actions, but rather, who was carrying them out. The party could call 
  for a 'struggle against bureaucracy' and the workers could ignore it while hating 
  the bureaucrats none the less. The in-fighting at the top levels of the party 
  was, nothing to do with socialism or workers, but with power, an imitation of 
  bourgeois politics. Lenin's 'struggle against the bureaucracy' was not for workers 
  to tackle the bureaucracy, but rather for yet another bureaucratic organ to 
  be set up to watch over bodies like itself.</p>
<p>
  Similarly Trotsky's appeals and protests were directed to the party: when he 
  was finally forced to turn to the workers, who all, along had been a mere object 
  to him, there was no way they'd pay any attention to him. Trotsky was not against 
  bureaucracy, nor against privileges or inequalities; but he wanted a 'better' 
  bureaucracy less 'exaggerated' privileges, less 'extreme' inequalities. Everything 
  he protested about was a consequence of a system he defended till he was killed. 
  Trotskyism then was nothing but a Stalinism in opposition : it still is today. 
  Unlike Trotsky, the Workers' Group attacked the whole political and economic 
  regime established by Lenin before the NEP: they traced the defeat of the revolution 
  to Lenin's whole approach. The basis of their program was the old but still 
  valid slogan &quot;The emancipation of the workers must be the task of the workers 
  themselves&quot;. They were against the dictatorship of the single party and 
  the bureaucratic organization of production. For them, socialism was the free 
  creative act of the workers. In 1923 they produced a manifesto that attacked 
  the 'leader cult', and led some of the strikes that took place that year.</p>
<p>
  The 'Decemist' Volodya Smirnov went further than the Workers' Group : &quot;There 
  never has been a proletarian revolution, nor a dictatorship of the proletariat 
  in Russia, there has simply been a 'popular revolution' from below and a dictatorship 
  from above. Lenin was never an ideologist of the proletariat. From beginning 
  to end he was an ideologist of the intelligentsia.&quot; The workers in Russia 
  in 1917 went further than Lenin intended in his schema of the stages the revolution 
  ought to go through, so he held them back. He wanted the workers to supervise 
  the capitalists who would still run the factories -- a policy of class collaboration. 
  But the real class struggle was fought out with owners sabotaging the economy 
  and workers taking over the factories. Against the socialist aspirations of 
  the factory committees Lenin and the Bolsheviks offered state capitalism. In 
  destroying the factory committees the Bolsheviks ended all moves to socialism; 
  in securing their unchallenged rule, they had to defeat the working class completely, 
  and that they did. The fatal failing of the factory committees was that they 
  left politics to the soviets and the Bolsheviks, concentrating their efforts 
  on economics. </p>
<p>
  In Spring 1928 a Yugoslav railway man who'd been in Russia during the revolution 
  said &quot;The situation today is very different from what it was in my time; 
  the manual worker is once more caught in the trap, the bureaucrats live as the 
  bourgeois used to live and their wives play a corresponding part. What is needed 
  is a new revolution,&quot; A skilled worker commented: &quot;We live worse now 
  than at the time of the capitalists. If we had to face such starvation, if our 
  salaries had been so low in the days of our old masters, we would have gone 
  on strike a thousand times. But what can we do now?&quot; Finally, the comment 
  of a textile worker, himself a foreign Communist: &quot;Never in my life have 
  I known such slavery as there is in my factory. If such a thing existed in a 
  bourgeois country, I would have thrown a bomb at it a long time ago !&quot;
