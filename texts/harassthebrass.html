<p class="subtitle">Some notes toward the subversion of the US armed forces</p>
<p>A friend who was in the U.S. military during the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War told 
  me that before President G.H.W. Bush visited the troops in Saudi Arabia, enlisted 
  men and women who would be in Bush&#8217;s immediate vicinity had their rifle 
  and pistol ammunition taken away from them. This was supposedly done to avoid 
  &#8220;accidents.&#8221; But it was also clear to people on the scene that Bush 
  and his corporate handlers were somewhat afraid of the enlisted people who Bush 
  would soon be killing in his unsuccessful re-election campaign.</p>
<p>The suppressed history of the last big U.S. war before &#8216;Operation Desert 
  Storm&#8217; shows that the Commander-in-Chief had good reason to fear and distrust 
  his troops. Our rulers want us to forget what happened during the Vietnam war 
  - especially what happened inside the U.S. armed forces during the war. Our 
  rulers remember it all too well. They want us to forget what defeated their 
  war effort, and the importance of resistance to the war by enlisted men and 
  women. </p>
<p>Until 1968 the desertion rate for U.S. troops in Vietnam was lower than in 
  previous wars. But by 1969 the desertion rate had increased fourfold. This wasn&#8217;t 
  limited to Southeast Asia; desertion rates among G.I.&#8217;s were on the increase 
  worldwide. For soldiers in the combat zone, insubordination became an important 
  part of avoiding horrible injury or death. As early as mid-1969, an entire company 
  of the 196th Light Infantry Brigade sat down on the battlefield. Later that 
  year, a rifle company from the famed 1st Air Cavalry Division flatly refused 
  - on CBS TV - to advance down a dangerous trail. In the following 12 months 
  the 1st Air Cav. notched up 35 combat refusals. </p>
<p>From mild forms of political protest and disobedience of war orders, the resistance 
  among the ground troops grew into a massive and widespread &#8220;quasi-mutiny&#8221; 
  by 1970 and 1971. Soldiers went on &#8220;search and avoid&#8221; missions, 
  intentionally skirting clashes with the Vietnamese, and often holding three-day-long 
  pot parties instead of fighting.<br>
  By 1970, the U.S. Army had 65,643 deserters, roughly the equivalent of four 
  infantry divisions. In an article published in the Armed Forces Journal (June 
  7, 1971), Marine Colonel Robert D. Heinl Jr., a veteran combat commander with 
  over 27 years experience in the Marines, and the author of Soldiers Of The Sea, 
  a definitive history of the Marine Corps, wrote: &#8220;By every conceivable 
  indicator, our army that remains in Vietnam is in a state approaching collapse, 
  with individual units avoiding or having refused combat, murdering their officers 
  and non-commissioned officers...Sedition, coupled with disaffection from within 
  the ranks, and externally fomented with an audacity and intensity previously 
  inconceivable, infest the Armed Services...&#8221; Heinl cited a New York Times 
  article which quoted an enlisted man saying, &#8220;The American garrisons on 
  the larger bases are virtually disarmed. The lifers have taken our weapons away...there 
  have also been quite a few frag incidents in the battalion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Frag incidents&#8221; or &#8220;fragging&#8221; was soldier slang in 
  Vietnam for the killing of strict, unpopular and aggressive officers and NCO&#8217;s. 
  The word apparently originated from enlisted men using fragmentation grenades 
  to off commanders. Heinl wrote, &#8220;Bounties, raised by common subscription 
  in amounts running anywhere from $50 to $1,000, have been widely reported put 
  on the heads of leaders who the privates and SP4s want to rub out. &#8220;Shortly 
  after the costly assault on Hamburger Hill in mid-1969, the GI underground newspaper 
  in Vietnam, GI Says, publicly offered a $10,000 bounty on Lieutenant Colonel 
  Weldon Hunnicutt, the officer who ordered and led the attack.</p>
<p>&#8220;The Pentagon has now disclosed that fraggings in 1970 (209 killings) 
  have more than doubled those of the previous year (96 killings). Word of the 
  deaths of officers will bring cheers at troop movies or in bivouacs of certain 
  units.&#8221; Congressional hearings on fraggings held in 1973 estimated that 
  roughly 3% of officer and non-com deaths in Vietnam between 1961 and 1972 were 
  a result of fraggings. But these figures were only for killings committed with 
  grenades, and didn&#8217;t include officer deaths from automatic weapons fire, 
  handguns and knifings. The Army&#8217;s Judge Advocate General&#8217;s Corps 
  estimated that only 10% of fragging attempts resulted in anyone going to trial. 
  In the America l Division, plagued by poor morale, fraggings during 1971 were 
  estimated to be running around one a week. War equipment was frequently sabotaged 
  and destroyed. </p>
<p>By 1972 roughly 300 anti-war and anti-military newspapers, with names like 
  Harass the Brass, All Hands Abandon Ship and Star Spangled Bummer had been put 
  out by enlisted people. &#8220;In Vietnam,&#8221; wrote the Ft. Lewis-McCord 
  Free Press, &#8220;The Lifers, the Brass, are the true enemy...&#8221; Riots 
  and anti-war demonstrations took place on bases in Asia, Europe and in the United 
  States. By the early 1970s the government had to begin pulling out of the ground 
  war and switching to an &#8220;air war,&#8221; in part because many of the ground 
  troops who were supposed to do the fighting were hamstringing the world&#8217;s 
  mightiest military force by their sabotage and resistance.</p>
<p>With the shifting over to an &#8220;air war&#8221; strategy, the Navy became 
  an important centre of resistance to the war. In response to the racism that 
  prevailed inside the Navy, black and white sailors occasionally rebelled together. 
  The most significant of these rebellions took place on board the USS Constellation 
  off Southern California, in November 1972. In response to a threat of less-than-honourable 
  discharges against several black sailors, a group of over 100 black and white 
  sailors staged a day-and-a-half long sit-in. Fearful of losing control of his 
  ship at sea to full-scale mutiny, the ship&#8217;s commander brought the Constellation 
  back to San Diego. One hundred thirty-two sailors were allowed to go ashore. 
  They refused orders to reboard the ship several days later, staging a defiant 
  dockside strike on the morning of November 9. In spite of the seriousness of 
  the rebellion, not one of the sailors involved was arrested.</p>
<p>Sabotage was an extremely useful tactic. On May 26, 1970, the USS Anderson 
  was preparing to steam from San Diego to Vietnam. But someone had dropped nuts, 
  bolts and chains down the main gear shaft. A major breakdown occurred, resulting 
  in thousands of dollars worth of damage and a delay of several weeks. Several 
  sailors were charged, but because of a lack of evidence the case was dismissed. 
  With the escalation of naval involvement in the war the level of sabotage grew. 
  In July of 1972, within the space of three weeks, two of the Navy&#8217;s aircraft 
  carriers were put out of commission by sabotage. On July 10, a massive fire 
  swept through the admiral&#8217;s quarters and radar centre of the USS Forestall, 
  causing over $7 million in damage. This delayed the ship&#8217;s deployment 
  for over two months. In late July, the USS Ranger was docked at Alameda, California. 
  Just days before the ship&#8217;s scheduled departure for Vietnam, a paint-scraper 
  and two 12-inch bolts were inserted into the number-four-engine reduction gears 
  causing nearly $1 million in damage and forcing a three-and-a-half month delay 
  in operations for extensive repairs. The sailor charged in the case was acquitted. 
  In other cases, sailors tossed equipment over the sides of ships while at sea.</p>
<p>The House Armed Services Committee summed up the crisis of rebellion in the 
  Navy: &#8220;The U.S. Navy is now confronted with pressures...which, if not 
  controlled, will surely destroy its enviable tradition of discipline. Recent 
  instances of sabotage, riot, wilful disobedience of orders, and contempt for 
  authority...are clear-cut symptoms of a dangerous deterioration of discipline.&#8221; 
  The rebellion in the ranks didn&#8217;t emerge simply in response to battlefield 
  conditions. A civilian anti-war movement in the U.S. had emerged on the coat 
  tails of the civil rights movement, at a time when the pacifism-at-any-price 
  tactics of civil rights leaders had reached their effective limit, and were 
  being questioned by a younger, combative generation. Working class blacks and 
  Latinos served in combat units out of all proportion to their numbers in American 
  society, and major urban riots in Watts, Detroit and Newark had an explosive 
  effect on the consciousness of these men. After the assassination of Martin 
  Luther King Jr. major riots erupted in 181 U.S. cities; at that point the rulers 
  of the United States were facing the gravest national crisis since the Civil 
  War. And the radical movement of the late 1960&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t limited 
  to the United States. Large-scale rebellion was breaking out all over the world, 
  in Latin American and Europe and Africa, and even against the Maoists in China; 
  its high point was the wildcat general strike that shut down France in May, 
  1968, the last time a major industrialised democracy came close to social revolution.</p>
<p>The crisis that racked American society during the Vietnam war was a grave 
  development in the life of what had been a very stable and conservative society, 
  but it wasn&#8217;t profound enough to create an irreparable rupture between 
  the rulers and the ruled. In the early 1970&#8217;s, the U.S. was still coasting 
  on the relative prosperity of the post-World War Two economic boom. Social conditions 
  faced by working people in the U.S. weren&#8217;t anywhere near as overwhelming 
  and unbearable as they are now. U.S. involvement in a protracted ground war 
  in Iraq today or Columbia tomorrow could have a much more rapid explosive impact 
  on American society.</p>
<p>A number of years ago, in a deceitful article in Mother Jones magazine, corporate 
  liberal historian Todd Gitlin claimed that the peaceful and legal aspects of 
  the 1960&#8217;s U.S. anti-war movement had been the most successful opposition 
  to a war in history. Gitlin was dead wrong; as a bourgeois historian, Gitlin 
  is paid to render service unto capital by getting it wrong, and get it wrong 
  he does, again and again. The most effective &#8220;anti-war&#8221; movement 
  in history was at the end of World War One, when proletarian revolutions broke 
  out in Russia, Germany and throughout Central Europe in 1917 and 1918. A crucial 
  factor in the revolutionary movement of that time was the collapse of the armies 
  and navies of Russian and Germany in full-scale armed mutiny. After several 
  years of war and millions of casualties the soldiers and sailors of opposing 
  nations began to fraternise with each other, turned their guns against their 
  commanding officers and went home to fight against the ruling classes that had 
  sent them off to war. The war ended with a global cycle of mutinies mirroring 
  the social unrest spreading across the capitalist world; some of the most powerful 
  regimes on Earth were quickly toppled and destroyed. </p>
<p>Soldiers and sailors played a leading role in the revolutionary movement. The 
  naval bases Kronstadt in Russia and Kiel and Wilhelmshaven in Germany became 
  important centres of revolutionary self-organisation and action, and the passing 
  of vast numbers of armed soldiers and sailors to the side of the Soviets allowed 
  the working class to briefly take power in Russia. The French invasion of Revolutionary 
  Russia in 1919 and 1920 was crippled by the mutiny of the French fleet in the 
  Black Sea, centred around the battleships France and the Jean Bart. Mutinies 
  broke out among sailors in the British Navy and in the armies of the British 
  Empire in Asia, and even among American troops sent to aid the counter-revolutionary 
  White Army in the Russian Civil War. Revolutionary unrest doesn&#8217;t happen 
  every day, but when it does break out, it can overcome the most powerful states 
  with a surprising and improbable speed, and the collapse of the repressive forces 
  of the state is a key moment in the beginning of a new way of life.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an ugly fact that war and revolution were intimately linked in the 
  most far-going social movements of the 20th century. With the U.S. governments&#8217; 
  self-appointed role as the cop for global capitalist law and order, it&#8217;s 
  likely that the crisis that will cause an irreparable break between the rulers 
  and the ruled in the United States will be the result of an unsuccessful war. 
  That day may soon be upon us. At that point, widespread fraternisation between 
  anti-capitalist radicals and enlisted people will be crucial in expanding an 
  anti-war movement into a larger opposition to the system of wage labour and 
  commodity production that generates wars, exploitation, poverty, inequality 
  and ecological devastation. An examination of what happened to the U.S. military 
  during the Vietnam War can help us see the central role &#8220;the military 
  question&#8221; is going to play in a revolutionary mass movement in the 21st 
  century. It isn&#8217;t a question of how a chaotic and rebellious civilian 
  populace can out-gun the well-organised, disciplined armies of the capitalist 
  state in pitched battle, but of how a mass movement can cripple the effective 
  fighting capacity of the military from within, and bring about the collapse 
  and dispersal of the state&#8217;s armed forces. What set of circumstances can 
  compel the inchoate discontentment endemic in any wartime army or navy to advance 
  to the level of conscious, organised resistance? How fast and how deeply can 
  a subversive consciousness spread among enlisted people? How can rebels in uniform 
  take effective, large-scale action against the military machine? This effort 
  will involve the sabotage and destruction of sophisticated military technologies, 
  an irreversible breakdown in the chain-of-command, and a terminal demoralisation 
  of the officer corps. The &#8220;quasi-mutiny&#8221; that helped defeat the 
  U.S. in Vietnam offers a significant precedent for the kind of subversive action 
  working people will have to foment against 21st century global capitalism and 
  its high-tech military machine.</p>
<p>As rampaging market forces trash living conditions for the majority of the 
  world&#8217;s people, working class troops will do the fighting in counter-insurgency 
  actions against other working class people. War games several years ago by the 
  Marines in a defunct housing project in Oakland, California, dubbed &#8216;Operation 
  Urban Warrior,&#8217; highlight the fact that America&#8217;s rulers want their 
  military to be prepared to suppress the domestic fallout from their actions, 
  and be ready to do it soon. But as previous waves of global unrest have shown, 
  the forces that give rise to mass rebellion in one area of the globe will simultaneously 
  give rise to rebellion in other parts of the world. The armed forces are vulnerable 
  to social forces at work in the larger society that spawns them. Revolt in civilian 
  society bleeds through the fabric of the military into the ranks of enlisted 
  people. The relationship between officers and enlisted people mirrors the relationship 
  between bosses and employees, and similar dynamics of class conflict emerge 
  in the military and civilian versions of the workplace. The military is never 
  a hermetically sealed organisation. Our rulers know all this. Our rulers know 
  that they are vulnerable to mass resistance, and they know that their wealth 
  and power can be collapsed from within by the working class women and men whom 
  they depend on. We need to know it, too.</p>

<p>INTERNATIONALISM IN PRACTICE: - An American soldier in a hospital explained 
  how he was wounded: He said, &#8220;I was told that the way to tell a hostile 
  Vietnamese from a friendly Vietnamese was to shout &#8216;To hell with Ho Chi 
  Minh!&#8217; If he shoots, he&#8217;s unfriendly. So I saw this dude and yelled 
  &#8216;To hell with Ho Chi Minh!&#8217; and he yelled back, &#8216;To hell with 
  President Johnson!&#8217; We were shaking hands when a truck hit us.&#8221; 
  (from 1,001 Ways to Beat the Draft, by Tuli Kupferburg).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. A few far-sighted individuals among the U.S. political elite apparently 
  fear that U.S. involvement in a ground war could trigger large-scale domestic 
  unrest. According to the U.S. magazine Newsweek, at a meeting in the White House 
  during President Clinton&#8217;s intervention in the Balkans, a heated exchange 
  took place between Madeleine Albright, then ambassador to the United Nations, 
  and then National Security Adviser Colin Powell. Newsweek gives the following 
  confusing and semi-coherent account; &#8220;...Powell steadfastly resisted American 
  involvement. He initially opposed even air drops of food, fearing that these 
  would fail and that U.S. Army ground troops would inevitably be sucked in. His 
  civilian bosses, who suspected him of padding the numbers when asked how many 
  U.S. troops would be required, grew impatient. At one meeting, Madeleine Albright, 
  then ambassador to the United Nations, famously confronted Powell. &#8220;What&#8217;s 
  the point of having this superb military that you&#8217;re always talking about 
  if we can&#8217;t use it?&#8221; she demanded. In his memoirs, Powell recalled 
  that he told Albright that GI&#8217;s were &#8220;not toy soldiers to be moved 
  around on some sort of global game board.&#8221; An official who witnessed the 
  exchange told NEWSWEEK that Powell also said something quite revealing that 
  has not been reported. &#8220;You would see this wonderful society destroyed,&#8221; 
  the general angrily told Albright. It was clear, said this official, that Powell 
  was referring to his beloved Army.&#8221; (&#8220;Colin Powell: Behind the Myth,&#8221; 
  by Evan Thomas and John Berry, Newsweek, March 5th, 2001)<br>
</p>
<p>Colin Powell was a junior officer in the fragging-plagued America l Division 
  during the Vietnam War. On numerous occassions, Powell has said that the US 
  defeat in Vietnam was the main influence on the way he sees the world. Powell 
  clearly understands that the armed forces are a function of the larger civilian 
  society that spawns them. Was Colin Powell speaking about the US Army -- or 
  about US society itself with his comment about seeing &#8220;this wonderful 
  society destroyed&#8221;? You be the judge!<br>
