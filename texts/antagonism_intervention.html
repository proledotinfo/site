<p class="title">Intervention / Communication / Participation</p>



<p class="subtitle">Introduction/Intervention/Injection</p>



<p>The precondition for any intervention is the separation of

those carrying out the intervention from those who the intervention is directed

toward. Intervention takes us back again to the situation of the enlightened

minority bringing revolutionary ideas.</p>



<p>The belief that revolutionary ideas originate outside of

the proletariat and are introduced from the outside has become associated with

Leninism. "Leninists" (at least the archetypical kind) accept this view and act

accordingly to introduce or inject their ideas into the hapless proletarians.

But if the notion that ideas must be injected from outside is, at least in

principal, rejected by many, the notion that communist consciousness originates

outside of the proletariat is still alive in the negative Leninism (the

"anti-bolshevik communism") of "councilism". "Councilists" (again in archtype)

take an opposite position to "Leninists", opposing the introduction of

revolutionary ideas, and favour spontaneity. Both tendencies, accept the same

fundamental separation between the enlightened minority and the ignorant mass. </p>



<p>Why?</p>
<p>The tenacity of this notion owes to its nature as bourgeois ideology. The whole 
  dialogue of outsiders introducing subversive ideas may be common amongst "Leninists" 
  and "Councilists", but the real home of this notion is in the bourgeois press, 
  the bourgeois media and bourgeois sociology. How many times have we read in 
  the papers that a demonstration turned into a riot, or a grievance turned into 
  a wildcat strike, because of "outside agitators" or "outside extremists"? </p> 
</p>



<p>But this notion of the separation of communism and

proletariat is not just a product of bourgeois media. It is also bourgeois

ideology in the sense that it is a reflection of the appearance of bourgeois

society. Communists do find themselves isolated from most of the proletariat,

just as non-communist proletarians find themselves isolated from most other proletarians.

Furthermore, the notion that the "outsiders", the "subversives", the

"revolutionaries", are sociologically different from the mass of workers, and

especially the archetypical factory worker, is in most cases true. Why

shouldn’t it be? Being a communist in a non-revolutionary period means above

all living in a period of defeat and knowing it, of desiring community of

struggle, but often being isolated. Much of the activity of communists in the

present period revolves around reading and writing. It’s obvious that such

activity attracts some and repels others. So what? Who says we have to be

sociologically typical? (It’s also worth adding that the proletarians, those

separated from the means of production, are less likely to be factory workers

than in the past.)</p>



<p class="subtitle">Communication/Community/Communism</p>



<p>Communism is not a product of an educated minority, even

if part of the reproduction of communism is through the writing and reading of

texts. Communism originates in the antagonistic nature of modern society - the

contradiction of simultaneous increasing wealth and increasing poverty,

precariousness, dispossession, the increasing subjugation of life to the

vagaries of the market. Communism and communists are a spontaneous product of

this society.</p>


<p>If communism originates in the proletarian condition, and

struggle then this has implications for the notion of "intervention". Whereas

"intervention" implies the monologue of the radical minority, communism

develops through multidirectional communication and through a partisan

participation.</p>



<p>What is usually meant by "intervention": ­ hand out a

leaflet at a demonstration or speak at a meeting, where you regard the majority

of your potential audience as imbeciles.</p>



<p class="subtitle">Final "Words"</p>



<p>All communication is to a greater or lesser extent

alienated, not just leaflets. If what underpins the ideology of intervention

needs to be criticised, that does not mean that every activity that might be

called an "intervention" has to be thrown out. Sadly, a leaflet is still in

many cases the best method there is to attempt communication, despite its

inherently unidirectional focus. Communists are not heroes who bring the

revolution, or dangerous intellectuals who will lead astray the "simple minded

proles". Mostly we are proletarians, but not ordinary ones, or no more ordinary

than all the others. We don’t have a historical role, but like many others we

have the need to live differently, and the recognition that this is a

possibility.</p>



<p class="subtitle">Postscript "VANGUARD"</p>



  <p >&nbsp;Pannekoek 
    made the point somewhere that ‘The proletariat is not weak because it is divided, 
    it is divided because it is weak’. It would be a mistake to think that if 
    a decent communist organisation intervened in the class then that would make 
    the difference, would create the proletariat as a force for communism. Communism 
    is then an act of will of the minority. On the contrary, it is only when the 
    proletariat is a fighting force with some degree of communist consciousness 
    that any communist class organisation really worthy of the name will be formed. 
    Then organisations will be formed by communists rooted in the struggle of 
    the proletariat, that is, by proletarians who see communism as a practical 
    task. In the meantime, we do what we can and what we must, but it’s the action 
    and situation of the class that will be central, not of the present minorities.</p>
