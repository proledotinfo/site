<P> Who is that told you that life is yet to begin? Or are you already waiting 
  for your pension? </P>
<P>Monday morning - get up, go out, call in sick, can't do anything else, don't 
  want to do anything else, just keep going. Get up again, go out, school, work, 
  get back, knackered, cook, wash. Time or money, stomach-ulcer-skin-inflammation, 
  just keep going. Friday, disco, cinema, friends, Sunday family walks. It is 
  enough! Let's not (!) just grin and bare it!</P>
<TD BACKGROUND="http://info.interactivist.net/images/wr.gif"><p>We spend out time 
    in the smoke filled workshops and humanised factory halls, in be-palmed offices 
    and steak-herb reeking kitchens. We sweat scrap-metal back together and magic 
    the sick well again. For our children there is only the new-deal-work-fare-training-schemes, 
    where they solder platinum for washing machines and anti-blockage-drainage-systems. 
  </p>
  <p>We get up every morning. We do it! Even if we have partied the whole night 
    through. Even with the squeezed disc in the back, relationship stress in the 
    head and love-sick in the heart, we just keep going. They have prepared us 
    for this. This is real life. No one ever promised us anything else. </p>
  <p>What the fuck is wrong with us? Whose madness is this? Who forces us? The 
    society? The state? The media? The patriarchal nuclear family? The temptation 
    of being able to have a part of the supposed riches? Mama? The weapons? The 
    capitalists? </p>
  <p>Is there not something else other that waiting-within-the-machine-rhythm-for-the-pause 
    with the boredom of Coronation Street-romanticism, the professional-development-further-training-scheme, 
    the now-I-discover-myself-workshop and thrill-addiction-parties. We need the 
    challenge, the adventure, the yearning, the struggle, the will to change all 
    that. We are searching for the subversion, the rebellion, the possibility 
    of revolt. And we search for it in this everyday life, in the offices, the 
    factory halls, the hospitals, in Tescos. </p>
  <p>We need the movement that does not hesitate, that lets our collective power 
    be visible!</I> <BR>
    <BR>
    We wrote and discussed drafts of this paper for almost a year and a half. 
    It was planned as a for our friends, work mates and interested people, with 
    whom we could see a common starting point for revolutionary organisation. 
  </p>
  <p>It seemed quite difficult to bring together our fundamental critique on the 
    existing relations with our longing to have practical action and to write 
    that all down. So we came to the point where some discussions in our group 
    could not go further. The language that we wanted; precise, clear and analytically 
    sharp seemed to be missing. And so it went on and on...</p>
  <p>What you now have in your hands is a discussion paper. This paper was a process, 
    it reflected the actual stage of our group discussions. In it we refer to 
    revolutionary currents of Marxism, Workerism, a revolutionary critique of 
    feminism and discussions with Wildcat.[1] <BR>
    <BR>
    The first part is about the basis of the exploitative society: work and the 
    division of labour. </p>
  <p>In the second part we describe how the relations of capital, gender and the 
    state originate from the specific practical relationships of people to each 
    other and from their position in the capitalist production process. </p>
  <p>In the third part we bring that together with our power to change things: 
    class struggle. In the fourth part we try to make an approximation of the 
    current social changes, the conditions for a revolutionary development: crisis, 
    proletarianisaton, flexibilisation. </p>
  <p>In the fifth and final part we sketch out our notions for revolution and 
    communism and our tasks in the revolutionary struggle. </p>
  <p class="subtitle"><B>1 Work</B></p>
 
  <p>It is not a natural situation, that we live in an exploitative, unjust society, 
    with hierarchies and divisions between men and women, nationals and foreigners, 
    rich and poor, with exploitation and oppression. This situation is created! 
    It is not based on natural power-craziness and egoism of people. It is also 
    only indirectly to do with bourgeois ideology, tradition, manipulative mass 
    media or the super control of the system. 
  <p>The situation is based on the concrete practice of six billion people: work. 
    Work is not simply comparable with concrete activities like pudding making, 
    suspension bridge building or beats sampling. We can do all these things with 
    out working. It doesn't matter if it is paid or not, these activities become 
    work if we cannot determine how, for how long, what for and with whom we do 
    them. <BR>
    <BR>
    Work is; having to slave for the banal things of life, because, although the 
    technical means of doing our work are possible, their development promises 
    no profits.<BR>
    <BR>
    Work is; not deciding collectively and thereby being productive, but slaving 
    away in our own households where we cook-clean-comfort or inside the walls 
    of factories and offices.<BR>
    <BR>
    Work is; to be restricted to defined activities: Brick laying, dispensing 
    soul comfort, day-in day-out washing other people's floors...<BR>
    <BR>
    Work is; division of labour. We are not allowed to do everything, live out 
    the variety of activities - acting in theatres, attic building, philosophy 
    etc. - that the constitutes the whole of society. <BR>
    Through the division of work, it seems that society consists of lots of single 
    producers slaving away independently of each other in different companies, 
    departments, households, schools and potato plantations. Everyone seems to 
    be responsible for their own fate and to be independent from others. In order 
    to live in capitalism we are dependant on the work of the majority of the 
    workers of this planet: from miners in South Africa, HGV drivers in Spain, 
    car manufacturers in Korea, textile workers in China, programmers in India 
    to farmers in France. 
  <p>All together, the way that we produce this society is the basis of the divisions 
    between people and creates the total splintering of our lives that makes us 
    so sick: The national borders that fence us in, the prisons of genders, the 
    roles of citizen, workers or consumer, the separation of young and old, trainee 
    and qualified, the stress of free time and everyday work... The division of 
    labour produces these divisions between us and thereby creates the basis for 
    exploitation and oppression. Whoever can determine the work and work products 
    of other, whoever can use for themselves the dependence of people on the work 
    of others, has social power. 
  <p class="subtitle"><B>2 Capital, Gender, the State</B> <r>
  <p>In the following chapter we will describe how a fixed specific practice of 
    people creates a relationship that then governs them. How relations or connections 
    to one another, to the means of production and the work products face them 
    as something that controls them. <BR>
    <BR>
    We concentrate here on capital, state and gender, which are not, however, 
    structures that stand side by side that can be fought against singly. If we 
    talk about Capitalism, we mean the entire relationship. If we talk about class 
    struggle, we mean the struggle that directs itself against that relationship. 
  <p> <B>Capital, Exploitation and Crisis</B> 
  <p>We produce this world together, be we do not decide in what way we do it. 
    We don't have contact to the people who make our clothes, whose CNC machines 
    we build etc. The connections come about mostly through the capitalist forms 
    of the market, money, companies etc. Through this, these forms achieve a seemingly 
    independent existence, that defines our days: "Money rules the world", "the 
    state does this, VW does that". Through our separated co-operation our products 
    seem to take on a power over us: we turn into dependants of machine-time or 
    victims of inflation...<BR>
    Capital describes the relationship within which we co-operate in a world-wide 
    division of labour.[2] We seem dependant on capital,because it brings together 
    our divided work under it's command. That is the basis of capitalist power, 
    the basis therefor, of a small class holding the means of production in their 
    hands, being able to force us to work and exploit us. <BR>
    <BR>
    We don't stand up for eight hours in stuffy factories and punch out small 
    parts for Smarts or Playstations because we think that society has a need 
    for this crap. We go into the factories or offices and sell our labour power, 
    because we don't have any other way of sustaining ourselves. We need the wage 
    because we don't posses anything other than our labour power. We have no riches, 
    no means of production and, through the capitalist organisation of work, no 
    possibilities of coming together with the world wide producers independently 
    of capital. We have to graft away in isolated households, because otherwise 
    other people wouldn't be able to work or would have to spend so much on snack-fodder, 
    laundrettes and touchy-feely workshops, that the money would not be enough 
    to live on.<BR>
    <BR>
    However, not only are we robbed of our means of production, but we don't end 
    up getting the products that we produce every day. We don't determine what 
    we produce and the ways and means that we do it. The means of production and 
    means of subsistence that we produce stay in the hands of the owners of the 
    means of production. By this separation of us from our products they are thus 
    always able to force us to work for them.[3] Through this process, we daily 
    (re)produce the pre-condition of having to work, the basis of our exploitation. 
    <BR>
    <BR>
    The bosses want to present the theft of the products of our work as 'free 
    and fair exchange' - wages for work. The exploitation is hidden behind the 
    wage, being forced to work hidden behind the 'free exchange'. The capitalists 
    only gives us the wages, because otherwise we would starve and couldn't work 
    for them any more. In a much shorter time than our working day, we produce 
    the equivalent of our wages, the equivalent of the things that are necessary 
    for the subsistence of us and our families. Most of the time in the day we 
    are working solely for the profit of the small class of capitalists. This 
    profit, and not our needs, is the determining factor of capitalism. <BR>
    <BR>
    However just a small part of the profits go on the luxury hampers of whichever 
    fat-cat. The capitalists themselves are forced to turn a large part of the 
    profit back into capital, i.e. to invest in yet more machines, office blocks 
    and labour power. They don't do this because they can't stuff their faces 
    full enough, but because otherwise they would go bankrupt and wouldn't be 
    capitalists any more. What presents itself as the law of competition for the 
    individual capitalist, is the law of capitalist accumulation: Capital has 
    to become more capital through the exploitation of labour power.[4] 
  <p>The fact that we stay separated from the means of production and from the 
    products of our work, has to be enforced over and over again. This happens 
    through the production process itself that isolates us, the relentless rhythm 
    of the machine that wears us down, the boss that stands behind us and controls 
    us. And where the violence of work is not sufficient, a 'direct' form of violence 
    is used: foremen, company security guards, shift bosses and department heads 
    drive us to work harder and threaten rebels with dismissal. The capitalists 
    try to divide us along the lines of the work divisions using different working 
    conditions, wage levels etc between foreigners/ nationals, educated / uneducated, 
    men / women. The hierarchy between the exploited is supposed to make joint 
    struggle against the exploitation seem impossible. <BR>
    <BR>
    A social mode of production that does not arise from the need and collectivity 
    of billions of producers, but has as its only sense and purpose the increase 
    of capital; that for this purpose reduces the daily lives of most people to 
    (wage) slaves and thereby produces rage a-billion-fold; such a mode of production 
    also produces inevitable crises. These crises are not accidents of capitalism, 
    they are part of its contradictory organisation of production, its need for 
    accumulation, for the expansion of exploitation.[5] <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Gender</B>[6] 
  <p>Gender roles are a practical relation that both 'genders' produce, but it 
    is also a relation of violence and dependence, the daily experience of women. 
    Is someone tries to break out of this relationship, and doesn't act like a 
    'real man' on the building site, will often become isolated, or worse. 
  <p>If the idyllic little family turns out to be an isolation chamber, if women 
    refuse to let their little worker be the 'little boss' at home, concentrate 
    only on him, protect him from the loneliness of masculinity, she often finds 
    herself confronted with violence. Out of fear of not being able to have close 
    human relationships without female assistance, and the fear of being bottom 
    of the heap without being able to have dominance over the house worker, many 
    men try to keep women being functional through restrictions and the threat 
    or practice of violence. In order to get rid of these relationships of need 
    and violence, we need to get rid of gender itself.[7]<BR>
    <BR>
    Ones gender determines which tasks we carry out in the social division of 
    labour. It does that from fixed 'gender specific' wage work in production 
    up to practical characteristics and activities for example 'men' having to, 
    or wanting to, protect. Gender arises as a relation within the social mode 
    of production of capitalism, in the association and the acting out of fixed 
    activities, roles and identities. The development of the forces of production 
    - the expansion of social co-operation and the development of technical means 
    to lighten physical work - determines the character of the gender division 
    of labour. <BR>
    <BR>
    Capitalism found the existing gender division of labour, turned it into the 
    basis of isolating the form of reproduction of labour power and thereby used 
    it to bring down the capital expenditure. Giving birth and the rearing of 
    children was from then on synonymous with the production and reproduction 
    of labour power. The gender division of labour and the reduction of women 
    to the reproduction of labour power makes the divisions between men and women 
    fixed. That did not appear for the first time with capitalism, but the shift 
    in production from houses (farming or handicraft) into families in factories 
    and offices has fundamentally changed the social position of men and women 
    and created new patriarchal relationships. 
  <p>Feminine and masculine proletariats became separated from each other and 
    women increasingly become stuck into the isolated - unpaid - housework in 
    the nuclear family.[8] Men played a central role, due to wage work and the 
    associated control over the income, and the fact that places of production 
    became the centres of social change in capitalism. The exclusion of women 
    from organising and struggling meant their social degradation. <BR>
    <BR>
    The dependence of women on the income of men, ensured through marriage and 
    violence, built a framework within which women were supposed to perform particular 
    work for the capitalist accumulation: to produce the commodity of labour power; 
    take care of the reproduction, ideological disciplining and initial training. 
    Housework is part of the social co-operation, without which the capitalist 
    machinery won't function. In families and in the disciplining state institutions 
    girls and boys are introduced to the skills that needed to be developed for 
    later exploitation in house and wage work. <BR>
    <BR>
    Proletarian women as wage workers always play the role of the industrial reserve 
    army: where they can be exploited for the capitalist valorisation process 
    they are sent to the assembly lines - whether in the development zones of 
    South China, the Maquiladora sweatshops on the US-Mexican border or the electronic 
    hell-holes in central Europe.[9] Where struggle and the revolution of the 
    social modes of production demands dismissals, they are supposed to just back 
    to the kitchen, e.g. in the ex-DDR (East Germany) and other former eastern 
    block states.[10]
  <p>The gender divisions will always be used for this, to change the composition 
    of wage workers - to weaken struggle, to put pressure on wages and to divide 
    the workers. In wage work the particular capabilities of women are exploited 
    - communication, emotional sympathy, skilled finger work, due to women having 
    to learn this during their particular upbringing and disciplining. And then 
    the wage work is often just the continuation of their house work: the caring 
    for the sick in hospitals, the work as child minders or in nurseries, as cleaning 
    women or secretary in service to their boss. <BR>
    <BR>
    As a rule, this work is paid worse than equivalent work by men. In Germany 
    alone millions of women work in insecure working situations like 320 Euro 
    jobs (under the tax and national insurance level), part time work etc. All 
    in all the situation for most women is characterised by insecurity, low wages, 
    poverty and a 16 hour day for the boss, the husband and the children. <BR>
    <BR>
    Women are fighting against exploitation at work, refusing to do housework 
    and children rearing and telling their husbands to fuck off. The mechanisation 
    of households and the conversion unpaid housework into paid work (fast food, 
    caring...) was a reaction to this refusal. For many women paid work is the 
    first chance they get to overcome the isolation of the family and take part 
    in social life. On the other hand they only end up in a different form of 
    exploitative relationships.
  <p>The relationship between the genders has changed considerably in the last 
    few years due to the rebellion of women against their subordination - the 
    images of typical roles are changing, same gender love is almost accepted, 
    the new jobs break down the gender divisions and many women have become self-reliant 
    in their relationships, at work, in their organisational efforts, refusing 
    to accept everything and are choosing a single life over nuclear family stress. 
    <BR>
    <BR>
    Where women and men attack the gender divisions, they have to be re-enforced 
    again. Women have to be forced into the fulfilment of their 'duties' with 
    violence, men get drilled in the conscripted army and other 'men schools'. 
    With child benefits, marriage laws and personnel management strategies, men 
    and women are further forced into defined jobs, defined roles and learned 
    behaviours. But at the same time the division only works, because we reproduce 
    it over and over again as men and women - amongst ourselves and in relation 
    to the 'other gender'. Where new identities are created, as gay and lesbian, 
    as part of the women's or men's movements, there is an attempt to reintegrate 
    these forms into the capitalist process: equalities officers, funds for subcultures, 
    gay insurance policies, lesbian politicians. 
  <p> The liberation from gender, the struggle against oppression based on physical 
    characteristics, is part of the class struggle. Only the class of exploited 
    producers is able to destroy the gender roles. Not because the 'women' don't 
    have power without the 'workers', but because gender is a part of the entire 
    social practice.
  <p>Almost everything that we need to live, we produce in ways, in which we face 
    our co-operation and the means of work as capital, as a force outside of ourselves. 
    But not all the work in capitalism can be organised along the lines of a 'factory', 
    not all the labour necessary for the reproduction of labour power can be exploited 
    within a capitalist relation.[11] Through the capitalist ways and means of 
    producing this society, we don't only create the production units of factory, 
    the office and the hospital, but also of the household. <BR>
    <BR>
    House and wage work are both dependant on one another as existing parts of 
    the relations of production, within which we (re)produce our life in the forms 
    of class and gender. From this point, class struggle is the struggle against 
    work, against social modes of production, that create the exploitative relations 
    of capital as well as creating gender. <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>The State</B> 
  <p>The state presents itself as a 'neutral political institution' that exists 
    independently from the 'economic' sphere. This has the following results: 
    Union people request that the state regulates the undemocratic businesses; 
    socialists lament that the state is just for the rich parties and not the 
    'little people'; anarchists present the state as all-encompassing power, without 
    which the society would be free. Whether as a an operational partner or as 
    the main enemy, the state offers itself as the focal point for our struggle, 
    in order to integrate and diss-empower it. The state is part of the capitalist 
    exploitative relations. It is the political and violent form of enforcing 
    and preserving capitalist exploitation. <BR>
    <BR>
    Fundamental for the exploitation in capitalism is a mass of labour power, 
    that can only live by selling its labour power, or, does not have access to 
    its own means of production. The state makes sure that people stay divided 
    from their means of production on a daily basis, through wars and expulsion 
    from the countryside. Development aid, migration and population politics are 
    used to be able to control the new proletarians.<BR>
    <BR>
    The separation from the means of production has to permanently maintained 
    through threats and the use of violence: soldiers against autonomous actions 
    by landless people, police against factory occupations. State protection of 
    private property is protection of the owners of the capitalist class, protection 
    from the appropriation of the means of production by the producers and thereby 
    the preservation of the condition of exploitation. 
  <p> What is sold to us daily as the 'achievements of the welfare state' are 
    actually the states means of keeping us all as wage slaves, of controlling 
    our working lives and getting us ready for exploitation. Social aid and unemployment 
    benefits keep us being exploitable labour power, during the times when our 
    wage work can't be valorised. We get the money, but only if we show willingness 
    to work and give the state the chance to have insight and intervention into 
    our living situation. In school we learn the things that are required from 
    a labour force, particular qualifications, arse licking and obedience. When 
    working life finishes us off, the hospitals and nut houses make us able to 
    cope with life again. In conflicts between workers and capitalists the state 
    appears as a mediator: it offers the workers state-approved unions or its 
    employment laws for isolated conflicts and so ensures 'orderly relationships'. 
  <p>Apart from that it tries everything to get the conflicts to take place within 
    the working class: its 'migration and family policies' are always creating 
    new divisions and hierarchies amongst the exploited, the existence of individual 
    'nations' offers the possibility of diverting the workers struggles down nationalistic 
    tracks. 
  <p>However, the state is not merely a 'service' for capital. Its existence is 
    simply materially tied to profitable exploitation and work: without profit, 
    without the valorisation of capital there would also be no money for the state.[12]
  <p>The struggle with the exploitation changes the form of the state and how 
    the state tries to maintain the conditions of exploitation. Whether as military 
    dictatorship, workers and peasants state or a parliamentary democracy - neither 
    our demands, nor 'politics' changes the state, but rather our struggle against 
    the capitalist everyday life.[13]
<p>

The state is also not a 'thing' that exists unchanging and
independently from humans.  In our everyday material practice we have
to face and deal with the state and capital in the forms of
'politics' and 'economics'.  We seem dependant on the state and on
the 'politics', because we are dependant on particular social
activities that the 'state' carries out.[14]
Due to the separation into
isolated 'owners' labour power, small families, in companies, in the
town and country etc, we don't organise these activities together and
don't create unmediated connections between ourselves.[15]
state planning, laws to regulate social conflict etc seem to be
necessary.


<BR>
<BR>
    The of social activities in the form of the state has to be re-enforced daily: 
    the police and teachers have to become accepted as such, the state has to 
    get its own material apparatus produced etc. In times of heavier struggle 
    or crisis it becomes apparent that the state is not necessarily a given. Particular 
    tasks that are not organised by the state any more, the people have to, or 
    can, carry out communally again. E.g. in parts of Russia, where due to the 
    crisis, the state stopped undertaking particular social care duties, or during 
    the struggles in Albania, that reduced the state to its role as military power.<A HREF="#zufuss16">[16]</A> </A> 
  <p class="subtitle">
<B>3 Class Struggle</B>
  <p> This is our starting point: out of specific practical relations of people 
    between themselves and to the production conditions, capital, the state and 
    gender arises as oppressive relations. Now to the deciding question: how can 
    we destroy these relations and create a different way to live together? We 
    look for the possibilities of change, for liberation from the power and find 
    it in everyday exploitation itself. <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Our Power to Make Changes</B> 
  <p>The isolation within the capitalist society gives us the daily experiences 
    of facing powerlessness in the relationships: we stand alone in front of the 
    boss and colleagues looking either like big girls blouses or as macho: the 
    police catch our foreign girlfriend in a raid and deport her; our dole money 
    gets cut and cut because the state supposedly has no more money; the bosses 
    close down the companies, because they can allegedly get more work for less 
    wages somewhere else etc.<BR>
    <BR>
    The possibility of liberation from this powerlessness is in our daily social 
    practice. It is the world-wide co-operation of work, that create capital, 
    the state, the gender relations every day a-new. In struggles we can break 
    out of those relations and get to know that we are not isolated individuals, 
    but that, together with all the exploited in the world, we form cohesion of 
    divided labour. This can turn into the material power of a movement, within 
    which we liberate ourselves from these relations:<BR>
    <BR>
    We can destroy capital, because money will become old paper and machines become 
    scrap metal, if we don't use them or they are not used. The power of capital 
    over living labour has an end, if the struggle overcomes the apparent divisions 
    of social production in house holds, companies, nations etc.
  <p>We can seize and destroy the state, because it does not produce its own apparatus, 
    but rather is dependant on capitalist exploitation, from 'orderly' relations 
    in its schools, universities, prisons and offices. The state would disintegrate, 
    if the movement of the exploited jumped over the school walls and liberated 
    knowledge; if we take our conflicts out of the courts and rule ourselves; 
    if take a break from the job centre waiting rooms because we are no longer 
    a permanently available labour force; if we tear down the border fences, because 
    without exploitation there would also be no need for 'national labour market' 
    or 'locations'.
  <p>We can destroy gender, because it is a practical social relation that changes 
    through class confrontation and in capitalist development. Within the struggle 
    we can develop desires that no longer have to be in the form of gender divisions. 
    In the struggle we can break out of our isolation and together hit back at 
    the sexist attacks. In revolutionary struggle we can destroy the material 
    basis of gender division, the isolation of households, the different forms 
    of house and wage work, the private ownership of knowledge about our own bodies. 
    <BR>
    <BR>
    That is the struggle against work. The struggle against a social activity 
    that is the basis for exploitation and oppression. It is the revolutionary 
    critique and the power to make changes. This critique is not born on a desk 
    or in a lefty seminar, but where we come together every day, where through 
    our work, we create the power of capital over the producers. in dingy backyard 
    workshops, in kitchens and canteens, at the assembly line and street corners, 
    behind fast-food counters, in hi-tech offices, university lecture halls and 
    in coffee plantations, the confrontations take place that embody the possibility 
    of a movement that can change everything. The rage expresses itself in conflicts 
    large or small, in the refusal to put up with the drudgery and disciplining. 
    Calling in sick, working slowly, taking longer breaks, nicking stuff and annoying 
    the 'little boss' are forms of the daily little wars by individual workers. 
    These conflicts are permanent. There is no consensus over the exploitation. 
    It stays a part of the capitalist development, or could be diffused in biannual 
    balloted union-lead half-day work-to-rule actions, if the isolation of the 
    conflicts does not break out into common struggle. <BR>
    <BR>
    Revolutionary situations arise, if the exploited turn their daily divided 
    co-operation around, and into organising their struggle: if the office workers 
    don't work away to the rhythm of some other workers PC-inputs, but rather 
    use the intranet to co-ordinate the strike; if the assembly line workers don't 
    have to try to catch up with the assembler before her, but rather use the 
    co-operation to bring the whole assembly to a stand still; if the struggle 
    in the schools ruins the a whole coming generation of workers; if joint proletarian 
    rent strikes or mass-shoplifting was organised in the play-groups and parent 
    and toddler groups. <BR>
    <BR>
    The struggle develops a material power, because it suspends the capitalist 
    accumulation and undermines the state. <BR>
    <BR>
    The self-organisation of the struggle by the strugglers is only possible in 
    those conflicts that result from the daily structures of forced co-operation. 
    <BR>
    <BR>
    In these conflicts the relationships and needs change. In this way we get 
    to know, the means and possibilities are there to create an-other non-capitalist 
    community. In these struggles there is the chance to 'out' as paper tigers, 
    the supposed supremacy of capital, the seeming independence of the state and 
    naturalness of gender relations. Because the practical relations to each other 
    and to the means of production change and because in struggle they can be 
    developed and created without capitalist mediation. This real movement within 
    capitalist exploitation we call <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Class Struggle</B> 
  <p>If we talk about class, we are coming from the view that, the work of people 
    creates the private property of the means of production - and thereby the 
    basis of themselves as property-less and exploited proletariat. The class 
    is not a club that people belong to or not. It is also not a category, in 
    which people can be ordered in 'objective attributes'. Class originates as 
    a movement, if the exploited use their productive relations against the exploitation.<BR>
    <BR>
    This process is class.<BR>
    <BR>
    The material conditions of production and the form of how the class fight 
    against these conditions, are directly interrelated and always changes through 
    the confrontations. Every collective activity, every struggle impels the capitalists 
    and their 'little bosses' to appoint or dismiss new people (with different 
    'qualifications'), to introduce new technology, different 'teaching methods', 
    wage systems or work organisation, to invite or deport immigrants. These changes 
    within capitalist production also change the ways we can fight and gives a 
    new face to the class struggle. Self employed long distance lorry drivers 
    will find other ways to struggle than call-centre workers or care workers. 
    New immigrants bring different experiences to the struggle from workers who 
    have worked for the same company for years. The revolt will hit the capitalist 
    accumulation more directly in a Maquiladoras factory tied in the world wide 
    production chain as in a backyard workshop in Haywards Heath that is only 
    locally economically active. <BR>
    <BR>
    Revolutionary initiative has to be based on these concrete material conditions 
    and the already existing organisational endeavours of the class, if we intervene 
    in struggle. The usual organisational suggestions, valid for all sectors, 
    points in time and situations of struggle, like those made by parties, workers 
    councils or syndicalist unions can only hinder the self-movement of the class. 
    <BR>
    <BR>
    Class struggle is in very few cases a 'attack on capitalism', but rather struggle 
    against concrete exploitative situations. It does not require the unity of 
    the exploited, but rather in itself, tackles the hierarchy between the workers. 
    The divisions and splits within the proletariat is re-created daily through 
    the ways and means of capitalist production. It often comes to confrontation 
    between workers, if the varying positions of workers in the production process 
    is attacked along with the attack on the organisation of work. The possibility 
    of breaking out of the divisions, the chance of real change can only be found 
    in these struggles.<BR>
    <BR>
    In confrontations most unions use the slogan "unity of all the exploited" 
    in order to get the conflict under control or to stifle it: "We can only fight, 
    if everybody joins in, but not everyone is joining in... There are so many 
    differences between the workers, so we need a strong union organisation here... 
    You can't beat up the headmaster, he is also just a wage dependant..." Those 
    parts of the proletariat who are fundamentally attacking the work and the 
    resulting hierarchies and divisions are at the forefront of driving the process 
    forward. <BR>
    <BR>
    We have to support even those struggles that are against another part of the 
    proletariat: The struggle of school kids, if it has to be enforced against 
    the orderly parents and teachers; the revolt of black factory workers, if 
    their foreman stands against them; the strike of skilled workers, if they 
    can't stop unskilled workers from strike breaking; the self-organised women 
    in the factory, if they would be sabotaged by the male union. <BR>
    <BR>
    Within these daily confrontations we look for the tendencies that do not let 
    themselves be absorbed by capitalist development, but that burst open and 
    go beyond it. These tendencies can seldom be clearly recognised by their 'external 
    form' of struggle: the stated demands, the 'official' leaders, the questions 
    of whether a conflict is peaceful or violent, initially says very little about 
    the 'revolutionary content' of the struggle. The strugglers may experience 
    less collective power and liberation in a union institutionalised general 
    strike for 15 percent more wages, than in a wildcat strike for 2 percent. 
    <BR>
    <BR>
    Whether revolutionary tendencies of self liberation from the existing relations 
    of production/learning/living arise in the struggles depends upon whether 
    the strugglers
<blockquote>* find forms of self organisation, that bring forth new collective relationships, 
    and within the struggle undermine the hierarchical divisions of labour. <BR>
    * take possession of the means of production in such a way that they can no 
    longer be used as a means of enforcing work, but rather become means of abolishing 
    work.<BR>
    * break out of the divisions of everyday work such as professional and language 
    groups, department, housing estates and company walls etc.<BR>
    * hit capital and the state through the struggle and so can be an example 
    of workers power for other proletariats. </blockquote>
  <p class="subtitle">
<B>4 Tendencies</B>
  <p> The chance of overthrowing capitalism can not be explained through isolated 
    struggles or movements. Historical changes of the ways that we produce this 
    society, i.e. how we are exploited in capitalism, does not result automatically, 
    or through a plan of the exploited class, but through the class struggle and 
    the contradictions of capital. The development of capital has limits: the 
    struggle of the class does not only change the social mode of production, 
    through that it also creates the conditions for a world wide revolution. We 
    have to reveal these conditions in the current social changes make them the 
    starting point of struggle. Here is a rough example: <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Crisis</B> 
  <p>Asia, until 1996 the promised land of capital, that dreamed of everlasting 
    boom on the backs of a compliant proletariat, has had it's bubble burst in 
    the last few years. In Indonesia the rage of the proletariat broke out in 
    flames. In Russia, where the new businessmen and old 'soviet' company chairmen 
    are making big money, while many workers are not getting any wage at all, 
    and so are continually going on strike, bankruptcy threatens. In the 80s the 
    IMF and the World Bank let Central and Latin America off their debt, in order 
    to improve the exploitation conditions. Today millions of dollars have to 
    be pumped into the region, just to make sure the currency does not totally 
    crash. <BR>
    <BR>
    The basis of this crisis does not lie, as defenders of capitalism often maintain, 
    in adventure capital speculation, faulty management or corrupt governments. 
    These explanations are only there to raise the hope that the crisis can be 
    overcome through a 'better policy'. The causes of crisis is not reformable. 
    It is caused by the reactions of the workers against the exploitation and 
    the consequential sharpening of the contradictions of capitalist relations 
    of production. <BR>
    <BR>
    The crisis of capital is the crisis of valorisation: that for the exploitation 
    of the workers, the invested capital does not bring enough profit, that is 
    needed for the exploitation process.[17] Strikes, working slowly, refusing 
    new work models and enforcement of better living standards, without consideration 
    for the internal deficit or company benchmarks, leads to sinking profits. 
    <BR>
    <BR>
    If capital can not break these workers (re)actions and impose increased exploitation, 
    it increasingly goes looking for other regions with better valorisation conditions 
    - which is increasingly difficult, as there almost no regions left today where 
    the people don't know what capitalism means. Or else the ruling class try 
    to buy time needed for the enforcement of new exploitation conditions, but 
    taking out more credit, or with financial speculation. <BR>
    <BR>
    This does not succeed for them - when the profit from the increased production 
    doesn't cover the credit - it ends in a crash, like we have seem recently 
    in Asia, Russia and Latin America. That shows that today's 'Globalisation' 
    is not a sign of the power of capital, but primarily that it globalises its 
    crisis. <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Struggles and Confrontations</B> 
  <p>Uprisings in the last few years like the Chiapas-Mexico after 1994 and in 
    Indonesia 1998, daily strikes in the (newly-) industrialised Asian states 
    like China, South Korea etc and protest movements in the boom countries of 
    Latin America: that are struggles by workers in the new development centres, 
    whose increasing demands come up against the results of the worldwide capitalist 
    exploitation. 
  <p>The question is whether these class movements widen out and radicalise or 
    whether they let themselves, due to the crisis, be bound up into a new development-focused 
    dictatorship. After the exploitation model of the east block toppled, we find 
    ourselves facing a fairly open situation.
  <p>The strikes of the miners in Russia and Romania and the uprising in Albania 
    in 1997 are just the strongest examples of confrontation by workers, who don't 
    want to let themselves be a cheep labour force for a new elite or western 
    investors. <BR>
    <BR>
    The strikes in UPS and General Motors in the USA and of the Spanish and French 
    transport workers are examples of more openly led class confrontation in the 
    capitalist metropolises. Apart from that, the situation seems to be one of 
    a blockade: there are almost no struggles against the increasing stress of 
    work, but also that capitalism, is not able to implement any new profitable 
    exploitation regimes by its attacks.[18] <BR>
    <BR>
    There can't really be any talk of a global struggle. Many struggles start 
    from a position of weakness: company closures, defending against deteriorations 
    etc.. Many confrontations take on nationalist or of other forms of violence 
    within the working class. <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>The New Crisis Regime</B> 
  <p>The ruling class tries to use sharper state measures against the proletariat 
    to solve the situation of crisis and blockade. In the European Metropolises 
    these attacks are mediated by the 'socialist' and social democrat governments. 
    These governments try to solve the blockade in the direction of 'more work 
    - less money' by increased pressure on both working and unemployed proletariat. 
    By doing this the 'labour parties' play on their having good relations with 
    the union apparatus and pull together for the implementation of 'more work'. 
  <p>The instrument of the state against the class struggle has also been modernised 
    on a worldwide level: In the face of the crisis, the IMF has to make even 
    clearer to the credit dependant governments, that they can only get more credit, 
    if they enforce intensified exploitation against the local workers. In the 
    EU, member states no longer have the possibility, with the new unified currency, 
    the Euro, to avoid the struggles in their lands by currency manipulation.[19] 
    So the ruling class is having to challenge the struggles to a greater extent 
    than before, and seize hold of the workers and their work conditions in order 
    to lower the cost of wages, extend the work time etc. The immigration conditions 
    for workers from non-EU countries are further intensified. Workers are supposed 
    to immigrate as cheep labour in the wished for amounts, but otherwise should 
    be available for exploitation in the various regions of investment from the 
    Ukraine to Morocco. <BR>
    <BR>
    Besides some 'welfare state measures', the ruling class [20] have recently 
    had only the most brutal of all state deeds left, to solve the class confrontation. 
    The was in Yugoslavia in 1999 shows a new quality of the crisis regimes: The 
    left governments sold the bombing as a humanitarian action and, NATO wanted 
    to demonstrate, with this ideological motivation, their ability to reduce 
    every spot on this earth to rubble. <BR>
    <BR>
    Above all the war had an enormous effect on the class situation in the Balkans:
<blockquote>* The bombs on the Serbian big industrial plants managed to push through what 
    the Serbian regime had not managed after years of attacks: The fastest mass 
    redundancies since the Treuhand.[21] The 600,000 workers whose firms were 
    flattened by the bombing, will probably never now come together again in their 
    old work groups, in which they fought for such a long time against wage reductions 
    and redundancies. The war created a dispersed labour force, the basis for 
    the intensification of exploitation, as we can see, for example, from the 
    new work from VW or the Italian outsourced textile fleapits in Bosnia. <BR>
    * The struggle of students and workers against the repression and 'welfare 
    state politics' of the Serbian state, has for the time, being, become side-tracked 
    down democratic-nationalistic lines, as a result of the war.<BR>
    * In Kosovo millions became separated from their land and occupations and 
    had to flee. Many of them, whether 'Albanian' or 'Serbian' have to work somewhere 
    else, often as low paid competitors to the indigenous workers.<BR>
    * The new 'ethnic' borders and the selective EU policies of 'rebuilding' the 
    profitable regions like Croatia, Slovenia, and now maybe Montenegro separate 
    and favour certain regions, thereby creating the basis for new nationalistic 
    violence within the working class.<BR>
    * The Balkans are under military occupation. In this region, characterised 
    by the mobility of the workers, is now controlled by NATO troops and UN organisations, 
    who are the ones who now do the moving around. When the Albanian population 
    armed themselves in 1997 and brought vast areas of land out of state control, 
    the 'Blue-helmets'<A HREF="#zufuss22">[22]</A> </A> didn't venture into the 
    country. Today Albania is a NATO base. </blockquote>
  <p> The Yugoslavian war was a sign for the proletariat world wide: if we can't 
    solve the crisis through rationalisation measures and work discipline, we 
    still have a few bombing arguments for you. The exploited class have to get 
    into the offensive in the coming struggle, otherwise the ruling class, in 
    their desperate search for a way out of the crisis, will use the conflicts 
    such as between North and South Korea, China and Taiwan, India and Pakistan 
    etc at a reason for a war against the workers. <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Proletarianisation</B> [23]
  <p>In recent years, Capital had got stronger in the 'three continents' (Africa, 
    Asia and Latin America) and has really gone after Asia and Latin America, 
    because it has the hopes of realising higher profits there. The construction 
    of industry is only possible because there - especially in Asia - millions 
    of people leave the country for the city, leave their piece of land and have 
    to sell their labour force to the factory boss or corporation boss. They have 
    had enough of the traditional land based forms of exploitation and expect 
    betterment for themselves from the wage work and live in the city - information, 
    consumer goods, chances of more mobility...<BR>
    <BR>
    This proletarianisation means that the experiences of workers in Kuala Lumpur, 
    Kapstadt, Gaza, Sao Paulo, Lyon and Gelsenkirchen increasingly run in parallel: 
    factory work, computer entry, measures to combat rebellions, democratic rule 
    - we have to put up with similar conditions. Moreover, millions of workers 
    migrate in the oil regions, the industrial zones, in the construction sites 
    and in the households of this earth, fleeing from the situation in there regions 
    of decline and/or on the search for a better life. They are part of the global 
    co-operation and offer us the possibility of exchanging experiences and learning 
    from the struggles in other regions of the world. <BR>
    <BR>
    In Asia and Latin America the increase of paid work for women has provide 
    many women with their own income. Moreover the refusal of women to refuse 
    to graft away as unpaid and isolated housewives, drives forward the socialisation 
    of housework. It is doubtful as to whether the work at a McJob is actually 
    more pleasant than the home and hearth, however it takes them out of the isolation 
    of the house or the farm plot and creates better conditions to fight together 
    against exploitation and sexist laws. The crisis of housework undermines the 
    old gender division of labour, for without female house work, you're gonna 
    get pretty crap miners. The gender relations are in flux, because the new 
    jobs do not prop up and reproduce the fixed roles and rigid divisions that 
    have existed up to now. In many of the new jobs the old gender divisions tend 
    to be superseded and that changes the gender relations entirely. Similar experiences 
    simplify - together with the new technological possibilities of worldwide 
    communication - the exchange and co-ordination of struggle. <BR>
    <BR>
    And: The defence of individual handicrafts or small pieces of land in view 
    of the proletarianisation tendency often means nothing more than then defence 
    of poverty and hardship. Proletarianistaion means, more and more being dependant 
    on the work of millions of others, in order to be able to set the means of 
    production going. Through the increased introduction of machines, work is 
    often no longer individual skill or ability. <BR>
    <BR>
    Through this we see other producers less and less as a mere 'function', who 
    stands in contrast to ourselves by being able shoe our horse, or find the 
    right herbs against our illnesses (so represent that function that we need), 
    but rather simply a person, with similar skilled or unskilled abilities, like 
    ourselves. <BR>
    <BR>
    That is not only the prerequisite for increased capitalist exploitation and 
    competition, but also for a global revolution, not to liberate the work, but 
    to destroy it - for a class free society of free individuals. <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Flexibilisation</B> 
  <p>After the world wide factory struggles of the 60s and 70s the relations in 
    production have changed enormously. In order to break up of the core of militant 
    workers in the industrial countries and intensify the exploitation, new computer 
    based technologies and new forms of work organisation (e.g. group work) were 
    introduced in the factories. Whole sectors e.g. in administration, maintenance 
    and cleaning have been outsourced by large companies. Thought the attacks 
    on the power of the workers, the companies can lower the wages, i.e. the labour 
    costs. From the same reason subcontractors are given whole branches of production 
    and so the number of workers in factories is driven down. Using temporary 
    agency workers, temporary contracts etc new hierarchies of wages and contract 
    terms are introduced, to further divide the workers. That has been made possible, 
    because at the same time more people were trying to escape from the 40-hour-normal-working-week. 
    From then on they keep themselves above water by working hear and there, or 
    by using the state benefits and cash in hand work. <BR>
    <BR>
    One the one hand this means that we have much more varying experiences today. 
    Lots of workers have worked in a few different sectors and can be 'flexible' 
    in how they organised their work and entertainment. They have worked in other 
    countries, learned languages, built up contacts and got to know different 
    forms of struggles. Many have tried out the beginnings of self organisation 
    far away from the family, state benefits and unions. This could be the basis 
    for a new struggle, that is characterised by mobility, stores of experiences 
    for different exploitation situations and little respect for a career for 
    life. <BR>
    <BR>
    On the other side we need to put up with the insecurity, the so-called precarious 
    work conditions - part time, temp-agency, fixed term contracts... many of 
    us are forced to always hunt around for whatever jobs, that further shrink 
    our control over our own lives. And, the pressure to work was increased: by 
    wage cuts, by raising social contributions such as health insurance[24] etc. 
    that always leads to more "working poor", and by direct pressure from the 
    Benefits Agency or the Job Centre, who use the threat of cutting, or totally 
    stopping, benefits if you don't take a shit job or 'training scheme'. <BR>
    <BR>
    Here in Germany the red-green government has seriously taken on the reconstructing 
    the welfare state: Compulsory training schemes for young people are already 
    running, other plans are still in the wings: further cuts to benefits and 
    other outcomes through the introduction of a guaranteed income, the tying 
    of unemployment money to neediness - so no longer as insurance, where you 
    supposedly get back the cash you have paid in at some point, the introduction 
    of forced labour for those who refuse work etc..[25] All these developments 
    have contributed to a weakening of workers struggles in the core industrial 
    sectors in the last few years.[26] <BR>
    <BR>
    The outsourcing has also lead to increased significance of the communication 
    and transport sectors. Especially through the Just-in-time production, where 
    the suppliers have to supply their components in an exact time to the assembly 
    line, the production chain has become extremely susceptible to malfunctioning. 
    The strikes of HGV drivers in France and Spain, the car suppliers Johnson 
    Controls and the parcel deliverers UPS in the USA very quickly brought the 
    lines in the factories to a stand still, because the parts were missing. The 
    new production relations has made capitalism more vulnerable! 
  <p class="subtitle"><B>5 Revolution</B> 
  <p> In the last two years is has become clear in all corners and ends of the 
    world: capitalism has not triumphed, it is in crisis. The current crisis shows 
    that capitalism is not a superior social form, that the free market is a liberal 
    fantasy and that the political class only seem be have the possibility to 
    be able to predict and determine social developments.<BR>
    <BR>
    Times of crisis are times of radical social change, of changes within a exploitative 
    society. In these times the searching and questioning after a different social 
    perspective becomes louder from all sides, struggles and confrontations take 
    place with a new intensity. Therein lies the possibility of the class finding 
    a common ,liberating answer within the struggle. <BR>
    <BR>
    If the revolutionary perspective fails, the crisis will be the beginning of 
    a new exploitation regime. The ruling class has to enforce an increased expansion 
    of capital by squeezing the workers, until the pips squeak. Our role is to 
    emphasis, in the discussion within the coming class confrontations, that capitalism 
    and crisis are inseparably connected to one another, that the effects of the 
    ever intensifying crisis cannot be overcome through 'scrimping and saving', 
    but through the destruction of this absurd system. <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>Communism and Revolution</B> 
  <p>Some of the world wide tendencies described give hope to these changing times 
    and are signs that the exploited class can, through their struggles, change 
    the world and create a different one. The class struggle does not only intensify 
    the capitalist contradictions, it also changes the conditions under which 
    we produce our lives: we work more and more closely together; we are less 
    and less directly dependant on ploughing our fields or selling our products; 
    productive technologies are no longer concentrated in the metropolis; ever 
    more wealth is created (disregarding which sort), while ever less labour time 
    is necessary for the production of particular goods,[27] production is ever 
    more dependant on common knowledge, the communication and co-operation of 
    millions of workers worldwide. <BR>
    <BR>
    The coming movement of the working class will be situated within these conditions. 
    It will decide whether in the future, the increasing social productivity will 
    be directed against us in the form of capitalist machinery. Or whether we 
    use our productive collectivity as weapons in the struggles and as the basis 
    of communism, a society without exploitation and drudgery. <BR>
    <BR>
    Communism is neither some far-off utopia or a planned out society, but is 
    part of the struggle, in which the existing mode of production is changed, 
    new relations and new needs arise and the means are appropriated for the fulfilment 
    of those needs. The process will get violent if those who profit from the 
    existing relations, fight back against those who have had enough. The revolution 
    won't be some power coup, no taking over the power of the state. <BR>
    The existing organ of state violence will be destroyed, but the deciding question 
    of the struggle is whether the producers appropriate in this process the conditions 
    of production in a way, that makes the survival of a state or capitalist control 
    un-necessary and impossible. Whether they lead the struggles through self-organisation 
    and thereby create the basis for a society in which our needs are placed in 
    the centre and decide for ourselves how we meet those needs. <BR>
    In the revolutionary process the basis of the divisions of labour, company, 
    gender and 'international', must be demolished and the knowledge of the production 
    and the means to make it automatic must be socialised. Only then can the struggles 
    create being together without mediation through institutions, identities, 
    money and machinery to become in practice a society of free individuals. <BR>

    <B>... or the Wretchedness of Reformism?</B> 
  <p>When the crisis and confrontation comes to a head and the search for a revolutionary 
    movement becomes ever more pressing, the reformists from the left try everything 
    to diffuse the situation. Many fighters against neo-liberalism want to sell 
    us the old welfare state as a benevolent papa and they want to take action 
    against the evil world market together with the state and the unions. In the 
    fight against fascism, the violence of the state is happily overlooked, the 
    schools or universities are accepted, so long as there are not fascists running 
    around there. <BR>
    <BR>
    Instead of making an end to the misery of work, much of the left calls for 
    fair distribution of work or even demand more of it. Guaranteed income and 
    other 'give-us-crumbs' demands turn us into solitary victims, who are supposed 
    to beg the nation state for higher benefits or whatever other 'rights'. <BR>
    The red-green government builds on the fact that the left controlled protests 
    give them fitting ideas for their crisis management: guaranteed income, kombilohn[28] 
    etc. protects the workers in times of short McJobs, the 'work for all' wailing 
    creates the atmosphere for various work programmes. The youth should look 
    for their future perspectives in the sweat shops, the unemployed be thankful 
    for their new low-wage-daily-life... The 'Autonome' in times of crisis unpack 
    an Leninism that already smells of decay: the victims of the social 'exclusion' 
    should unite behind easily understandable demands and little by little become 
    accustomed to a supposed revolutionary consciousness. Along the lines of the 
    slogan 'follow us, we know the way to fight'.

<B>6 Revolutionary struggle - organisation of the revolutionaries</B>
  <p> Clearly - the movement, the offensive struggles are missing in our region. 
    So we have to ask all the more, how can we bring forward revolution? If the 
    revolutionary movement is weak, it is not because there is no political organization, 
    strong union or communist party. The origins of the weakness lie in the actual 
    conditions within the sphere of exploitation. We have to ask why the exploited 
    do not find a militant, liberating expression of their productive power in 
    this current situation. We have to find those situations where this defensive 
    position can be broken up. Therefore, we need revolutionary organizing. <BR>
    <BR>
    Revolutionary organizing has to support the self-liberation of the exploited. 
    It cannot take the form of mass organizations which go out on demonstrations 
    pretending to represent the demands of workers, students, etc. There cannot 
    be a "revolutionary policy" within union and political frameworks because 
    it is not the "issues" or "leadership" of unions or political organizations 
    that makes them reformist. The whole character of these representing bodies 
    makes them reformist from the start. The attempt to overcome the divisions 
    within capitalist production through "grassroots organizing of other workers" 
    in "all-encompassing" structures (neighborhood-centers, rank-and-file-groups, 
    etc.) or under generalised demands, will also, sooner or later, end up in 
    the politics of representation. The organizing of the class can only be the 
    result of the struggles within the capitalist organization of work, in firms, 
    universities and schools. Only in these attacks on the actual divisions the 
    organizing can be all-encompassing. The organizing of the class struggle only 
    takes place through and within the actual collective struggles. All attempts 
    to maintain it beyond that, end up as institutions. <BR>
    <BR>
    Revolutionary organising is not "organising of other workers" but of revolutionaries 
    who know their way in the sphere of exploitation and together look for tendencies 
    of a revolutionary movement. Their relation to other exploited workers is 
    neither "tactical" - as between functionaries and a revolutionary subject 
    - nor "enlightening". We know that we can only liberate ourselves in those 
    struggles where the exploited destroy everyday-capitalism and capitalist relations 
    between people. We cannot instigate struggles but we can summarize the most 
    advanced discussions, the weak points of capitalist control and the critique 
    the workers. And we can generalise these experiences and circulate them within 
    the sphere of exploitation. The relation between revolutionaries and workers 
    is that of a collective process: where is the possibility of workers' power 
    and self- liberation in the daily experience of exploitation? <BR>
    <BR>
    <B>What we have to do</B> 
  <p>Firstly, we need to take the actual conditions of class struggle, the current 
    changes in the world as the starting point.
<blockquote>
    * Where does a changing organization of the exploitation, of the organization 
    of work, technology, etc. lead to the weakening of workers' power and where 
    can we see weak points in the capitalist command? <BR>
    * Which effects do these changes have on the qualification, the migration 
    and mobility of workers and the labour-market? What is the role of the state 
    in this context? <BR>
    * What do the workers, students, etc. do about this situation, what do they 
    discuss? Where do forms of organizing and chances already exist that they 
    can use in the struggle?[29] </blockquote>
  <p>This means to analyse the restructuring of capital and the new composition of 
  the working class. In our region (Ruhrgebiet, Germany) we need to look at what 
  happened to the leftovers of the heavy- and metal-industry and which new sectors 
  and production chains have arisen. <BR>
    We need to find out, whether the skilled worker in the coal- and steel-industry 
    or the home- and part time-worker will loose their central position and whether 
    a new typical worker, highly mobile, working in the electronics sweatshops, 
    outside-suppliers and "service companies" will develop. This investigation 
    is necessary in order to understand the material basis for the upcoming class 
    struggles. <BR>
    <BR>
    Secondly, in actual struggles there is neither need for cheerleading nor for 
    moralizing and patronizing but for information on self-organizing:
<blockquote>
    * Where could a struggle have the most material power, where could it interrupt 
    the capitalist production and co-operation most effectively? <BR>
    * What kind of experiences are there around certain management strategies 
    (flexibilisation of working hours, teamwork, etc.)? <BR>
    * What forms of organizing were developed by workers in similar situations? 
    <BR>
    * Where on the world are similar confrontations taking place? </blockquote>
    
  <p>In order to contribute to the workers' discussions and struggles we need 
    to understand the issues of conflict in the different places of exploitation 
    and listen to the workers there. In our region there were strikes by assembly 
    workers at Opel Bochum, Turkish cleaners of railway cars and call centre-workers, 
    which we could have responded to. <br>
    <br>
    Thirdly, it is not enough to supply the right information for class struggle 
    and apart from that stay passive observers. When we have an analysis of the 
    situation we need to actively intervene in the struggles, offer a critique 
    of them and support their revolutionary tendencies: </p>
  <blockquote><p>*	How can a struggle be self-organized, how can the means of
production be appropriated as means of struggle?
<br>
*	How can a struggle widen out over the firm- or branch-limits
without ending up in the hands of unions or other institutions?

<br>
*	Where are hierarchies and divisions of the process of production
being kept up? Where does the everyday division of work along gender,
racism and qualification stay untouched?
<br>
*	Where does the state ideology of war, racism, etc. catch on and how
can that be substantially attacked? 
</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>For all this we need to get an inside view into the different relations of 
    exploitation, and it is necessary be able to react immediately to worldwide 
    changes. The relative silence in face of the war in Yugoslavia shows our weakness. 
    We need to be able to circulate information on struggles in Korea and against 
    social democratic/green party wars faster within the sphere of exploitation 
    and to organize actions. <br>
    <br>
    We will prepare for the upcoming struggles and build contacts outside of "our 
    sectors of exploitation" in order to get away from the dependency on 'their' 
    information apparatus. </p>
  <p>In theoretical discussions we have to gain the ability to criticise the conditions 
    radically and profoundly. We need to teach each other the practical abilities, 
    from lay-outs to sit-downs, everything we need to take part in and intervene 
    into the class struggles around us. </p>

  <p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
  <p>1 You can get a list of the texts from us - [email-]address at the end of 
    the paper.<br>
    2 Capital is not merely a collection of &quot;production circumstances&quot; 
    - of machines, work materials, labour force - that economics so often bores 
    us with.<br>
    3 This work often only exists because capitalist exploitation exists - in 
    order to make this possible: millions of car workers produce millions of cars, 
    so millions of workers can drive to work, in order to produce entertaining 
    articles, medicaments, holiday complexes in Majorca and soap operas, that 
    draw us in during our 'free time', in order to forget the work i.e. to be 
    fit for work again.<br>
    Thousands of job centre workers, hospital dogs bodies, research and administration 
    workers also come along on the ride, to provide us with even more jobs, to 
    inject us healthy or to research into new work. Millions of unemployed work 
    at finding a new job - i.e. at avoiding it. Prison wardens, cops, soldiers 
    and foremen carry out the disciplining of the worker themselves.<br>
    The 'organisation' of production is also absurd: the social production arranges 
    itself over thousands of separately producing companies, through the division 
    of production and circulation, mediated by money.<br>
    That also makes any amount of additional work: Various commodities are shipped 
    twice round the globe, not because otherwise it would not get to a particular 
    place, but because through the sale, despite a hundred times more transport 
    workers, more profit is realised. In house building, most of the work arises 
    because the workers of the different firms only have to do their own specific 
    assignments. What do I care about co-ordinating with those working after me 
    etc. (i.e. avoiding that they don't have any annoying extra problems created 
    because I was not working with them in mind) if the boss is on my back to 
    get to the next construction site.<br>
    4 The separation of the producers from the means of production can only be 
    maintained, if the producers are confronted with ever more capital - in the 
    form of machinery and co-operation with other workers. Earlier making twenty 
    workers graft away with hand tools was sufficient, so today CNC-Machines and 
    world wide production chains have to be implemented, in order to make proletarians 
    to work 'efficiency' enough. See more in the section on Crisis.<br>
    5 For more detail on crisis see under 'tendencies'.<br>
    6 This is an attempt. We noticed in our discussion that we still have to go 
    a bit further in order to be able to really explain: the changes within the 
    classes, and the gender relations in the context of the development of, and 
    the confrontations around, the social mode of production. Only if we know 
    these developments as interrelations, can we point out the revolutionary tendencies 
    that lie within them.<br>
    7 Gender also means limitations. Much work is still done in purely female 
    or male departments. Only rarely does work allow for real and intensive relations, 
    and moreover we can't really live out and enjoy our desires for closeness, 
    openness etc, because we hide those desires behind the 'I'm a lad's lad and 
    not gay' wall, or they get lost in the competition amongst women. In our 'free 
    time' the other gender - normally one person - is supposed to remove our experienced 
    absence of feeling and sensuality.<br>
    8 This was not an clear process: In the first factories in the 18th century, 
    initially the women and children were exploited...<br>
    9 If, as in north Mexico or the development centres of China, mostly women 
    are going into the factories and doing wage work, while men don't have a job, 
    or do 'housework', then accordingly the gender relations change entirely.<br>
    10 Here the contradictory situation of women is particularly clear: After 
    decades of being bound to both wage and house work, many women wan</p></body>
