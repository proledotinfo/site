<p class="title">Against the State as Boss</p> <p class="author">by the Autonomous Assembly of Alfa Romeo<br>Translated by Bruno and Judy Ramirez. From Radical America, vol. 7, #2. March-April, 
  1973.</p>
<p class="subtitle">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>This is the day-to-day account of a struggle carried out by the Alfa Romeo 
  workers from November 1971 to February 1972 on the occasion of contract renewal. 
  The struggles narrated in this document took place in two of the five Alfa Romeo 
  plants in Italy, the Portello and Arese plants, both located in the Milan area. 
  Together, both plants employ 19,000 workers (including office employees), and 
  a new Contract is negotiated every three years. The Portello plant is the older 
  of the two and has few production departments left. Soon most of its operations 
  will be shifted to Arese. The majority of its workers are older people, still 
  bound to trade-unionism by a long tradition of struggle. Arese is the newer 
  plant, still in the process of completion. It houses most of the production 
  departments, and most of its workers are young and without a union tradition. 
  Moreover, 65% of the workers on the assembly lines (as opposed to 25% in the 
  non-production departments) are immigrants from the southern regions of Italy, 
  and this element of the working class has been in the forefront of the struggles 
  since &#8216;68. For this reason the level of militancy and mass mobilization 
  was greater at the Arese plant.</p>
<p>The document was produced by a group of militants which calls itself &#8220;Autonomous 
  Assembly&#8221; (AA) which defines itself as &#8220;a rank-and file organization, 
  born as a communist cell with the aim of becoming a reference point for all 
  the workers within the plant, and of contributing to the building of the future 
  revolutionary party. The goal of the AA during the 
  four months of struggle was to become a permanent political reference point 
  for all the workers, to take away from the union officials and the Italian Communist 
  Party PCI) the control of the struggles, and in this way to be in a position 
  to &#8220;talk to the masses.&#8221; </p>
<p>The value of this document lies in the many faceted nature of the struggle 
  it describes. The workers were fighting against a form of state capitalism, 
  in that Alfa Romeo, although officially classified as a corporation with &#8220;state 
  participation&#8221;, is in reality completely state owned. This point is important 
  because it explains the pressure felt by the PCI to act &#8220;responsibly through 
  FIOM (the PCI and Left-wing Social Democrat metal workers&#8217; union) in view 
  of its possible future participation in a new Center-Left coalition in the Government. 
  It also explains the co-optive strategy adopted by the union officials, their 
  attempts to water down the more radical demands advanced by the workers, and 
  in particular, their determination to turn the councils of shop-floor delegates 
  into channels of control over the ranks. The date of the struggle is of special 
  importance. Taking place less than a year before the renewal of national contracts 
  of 1972, it served as a testing ground for the bosses and the unions to help 
  gauge the level of militancy of the workers and what might be in store during 
  the new wave of struggles only a few months off.</p>
<p>The key objective for the militants at Alfa Romeo was that of mobilizing the 
  workers for an attack against the company&#8217;s structure of job classification, 
  to force management to alter it to correspond to the objective process of massification 
  occurring in auto production. It also meant attacking the capitalist rationale 
  underlying the whole system of job classification with its built-in mechanisms 
  of selection based not on the actual expertise of the workers (which in any 
  case is being undermined by the massification process), but rather on the workers&#8217; 
  submission to managerial authority, goals, and values. (As the AA puts it: &#8220;You 
  will be &#8216;selected&#8217; not on the basis of what you know or are able 
  to do, but on the basis of your willingness to lick ass.&#8221;)</p>
<p>The militants proposed, therefore, that the six categories which made up the 
  company&#8217;s job-classification structure be replaced with four levels of 
  &#8220;classification&#8221; with automatic passage from one level to another 
  (on the basis of workers&#8217; seniority and consent), under the supervision 
  of the delegates&#8217; council. A similar proposal was advanced for the office 
  employees. These demands, as the document shows, were only partially secured. 
  The notion of &#8220;levels&#8221; was introduced, and automatic passage from 
  the second to the third level was granted, but with management still firmly 
  in control of the process of &#8220;promotion&#8221;. However, even if the actual 
  gains were meager, the struggles around this central demand served to mobilize 
  the mass of workers and carry forward the attack against the capitalist ideology 
  of work. Finally, the value of this document lies in showing the concrete forms 
  of struggle which the workers created from day to day, their ability to anticipate 
  the bosses&#8217; and the Unions&#8217; next move, and their success in analyzing 
  their Struggle in terms of its wider political significance.</p>
<p class="subtitle">NOVEMBER 12 (Friday)</p>
<p>The delegates&#8217; council decided today on six to seven hours of strike 
  for the coming week. There was a struggle between two lines: that of the unions 
  and that of the militant vanguards. The unions wanted to give the executive 
  the power to decide how many hours to strike and in what way. Though this line 
  was rejected, the unions were able to limit the duration of the strikes to six 
  hours. The line taken by the militant vanguards called for at least nine or 
  ten hours and a more incisive way of conducting the strikes, such as picket 
  lines, marches inside the factory, and so on. The union line is founded on the 
  conviction that at present the will to struggle on the part of the working class 
  is at a low ebb: &#8220;Reality is what it is; we may as well adjust to it, 
  try not to run ahead of ourselves ... (The unions &#8220;firemen&#8221; have 
  gotten so used to throwing water on the flames that they now throw it even when 
  there is no fire.) We of the Autonomous Assembly are not much more optimistic, 
  but we feel that if reality is indeed what it is we must first of all try to 
  analyze and understand this state of affairs and then try to change it by pushing 
  for a broader and stronger mobilization.</p>
<p class="subtitle">NOVEMBER 15 (Monday)</p>
<p>Today there&#8217;s a one and a half hour strike.</p>
<p>At the Portello plant, a general assembly is held in the cafeteria. An official 
  of the UILM (the Right-wing Social Democrat metal workers union) speaks for 
  over 45 minutes. No one can figure out what he is trying to say, and he is loudly 
  booed. As the workers begin to rule out an official from the FIOM arrives and 
  makes an announcement that explodes in the assembly like a bomb: &#8220;The 
  management,&#8221; he says, &#8220;due to technical difficulties, was unable 
  to complete the paychecks, and as a result, Instead of receiving a regular bi-weekly 
  check, each worker will receive $50.&#8221; Immediately a comrade seizes the 
  microphone and yells &#8220;Let&#8217;s go visit the management.&#8221; A procession 
  immediately forms and begins making its way toward the building which houses 
  the executive offices. A group marches into the president&#8217;s office shouting 
  &#8220;Luraghi, you fascist, you&#8217;re the first one on the list!&#8221; 
  As the word spreads that the strike will continue, the procession makes its 
  way through each department and office, pulling everybody out. Even the workers 
  who usually scab walk off the job when they find out that instead of their usual 
  paychecks they&#8217;ll be getting only $50. Union &#8220;firemen&#8221; are 
  trying to put out the flames by appealing for a &#8220;democratic decision&#8221;, 
  but no one is listening. Many departments stay shut all day, and scores of workers 
  go home, including those who arrived for the second shift.</p>
<p>At the Arese plant, another FIOM official brings the news of the reduced paychecks, 
  and all hell breaks loose in the general assembly. Amid shouts and jeers and 
  total bedlam the official tries to explain: &#8220;Comrades, this is a calculated 
  move on the company&#8217;s part; let&#8217;s not accept provocation. I propose 
  that a delegation be formed and sent to....&#8221; To Management, he no doubt 
  wanted to say; but we&#8217;re already on our way, all of us together en masse. 
  To hell with a delegation! The long procession of workers making their way to 
  the executive offices with raised fists gives me the feeling of being in Saint 
  Petersburg during the October Revolution. About 500 of us crowd around one of 
  the executives stating our demand: &#8220;We want the money, all of it now.&#8221; 
  In the meantime, under the window outside, an assembly is being held to decide 
  how to carry on the struggle: &#8220;Let&#8217;s all march to Milan!&#8221; 
  &#8220;Let&#8217;s continue the strike all day!&#8221; But once again a union 
  (FIOM) proposal passes: &#8220;Let&#8217;s be calm, comrades; the struggle won&#8217;t 
  end today. Let&#8217;s show some good sense....&#8221; Moral: The strike ends 
  at 1 pm. Luckily this decision is followed only in part. The upholstery and 
  waxing departments strike for the rest of the day, and many workers, even those 
  from the second shift, sit in front of their machines with arms folded. I have 
  been in the factory many years, but I&#8217;ve never seen such good assemblies 
  where everyone feels free to speak and where we&#8217;re finally beginning to 
  discuss political situations.</p>
<p class="subtitle">NOVEMBER 16 (Tuesday)</p>
<p>At the Portello plant: Internal processions form, and for the first time a 
  group of office personnel (about a hundred of them) enter all the departments, 
  combing them for scabs. In the engine department some of the workers can&#8217;t 
  believe their eyes: &#8220;How is it possible?&#8221; they say. &#8220;Now the 
  office personnel come to pull out the workers!&#8221; The strong participation 
  of the office employees is one of the most important features of this struggle: 
  Some of them, who until yesterday would leave the factory for the local cafe, 
  are right here beside us in the plant-wide procession. The slow and painstaking 
  work, person by person, is beginning to yield fruit. The first signs of raised 
  consciousness begin to show; even the office employees and technicians begin 
  to understand that they are exploited: They are starting to rebel against their 
  supervisors and bosses; they refuse to put in overtime. In short, they are discovering 
  the class struggle and looking to the workers&#8217; vanguard for a reference 
  point. Today, when with great excitement they went to pull out the scabs from 
  each department, a technician approached me and said: &#8220;You know, until 
  now I only came in here to see the machines; but today I&#8217;ve understood 
  that there are men in here too. From now on it will be different for me.&#8221;<br>
  At the Arese plant, this morning at 6 am, we of the AA passed out a leaflet 
  about the rent strike in a Milan district where a number of Alfa workers live, 
  then, on Strike between 9:30 and 10:30. Even though one hour is too brief, we 
  didn&#8217;t pass up the chance for an in-plant procession: We marched along 
  together, pulling out all the scabs. At the Computer Center everyone was working: 
  We forced them all out and started discussing the contract proposals, how to 
  carry on the struggle, how the bosses eat up our salaries outside the factory, 
  and how we must respond, namely with rent strikes, neighborhood struggles, and 
  the like, and not by sitting in front of the TV all night like morons, because 
  this is just what the bosses want. The discussion is prolonged because the workers 
  want to voice their criticisms of the way the struggle is being handled, that 
  is, with only one hour of strike at a time.</p>
<p class="subtitle">NOVEMBER 17 (Wednesday)</p>
<p>We found out that a meeting was held last night by management personnel. All 
  of them are really pissed off because they can&#8217;t work undisturbed in the 
  factory. Well, we had a meeting too, and decided to form a picket line at the 
  Portello plant until 10 o&#8217;clock, and this time the &#8220;firemen&#8221; 
  could not pull back. The picket line turned out to be really tough. The usual 
  scabs who hang around the entrance are rather pathetic; they just stand there 
  and don&#8217;t have the guts to come forward, not even to talk. They form little 
  groups, like bigots outside a church; they whisper, shake their heads, deplore, 
  and so on. But they don&#8217;t move; they wait for someone else to cross the 
  picket line for them. As always when a picket line is formed, the comrades use 
  the occasion to discuss political questions, to clear up doubts and encourage 
  those who waver. The results of these discussions aren&#8217;t always immediate, 
  but in the long run they leave their mark; you find people beside you In later 
  struggles that you&#8217;d never expect.</p>
<p>At the Arese plant, a strike is on from 9:30 to 11 am. There is no picket line, 
  but a massive procession is held. There are more than 3,000 workers, and they 
  make the rounds and clean out the whole factory. Leading the march is a giant 
  banner with the three metal-worker union names (FIOM, FIM, and UILM) and the 
  phrase underneath &#8220;the delegates&#8217; council&#8221;. Leading is also 
  our Armstrong, a comrade who plays the trumpet and can belt out favorite proletarian 
  songs like The Internationale. Suddenly in the distance we hear a deafening 
  noise: A few comrades have managed to open up some vehicles in the last phase 
  of production and are honking all the horns in unison! For the trade unionists 
  the most important thing is that this &#8220;long walk&#8221; in the factory 
  be &#8220;orderly and responsible,&#8221; but the comrades don&#8217;t forget 
  that their duty is to drive out the scabs, and at intervals they leave the procession 
  and, forming separate groups, make their way into the departments.</p>
<p class="subtitle">NOVEMBER 19 (Friday)</p>
<p>At the Portello plant, the office workers strike from 3 pm on. They meet together 
  and decide to comb the entire plant for scabs, because &#8220;It isn&#8217;t 
  right to just go to the same few offices.&#8221; A number of offices are already 
  empty because the managers, eyes of the boss, are absent. But scabs are not 
  lacking. Those beginning their strike at 4 pm join the procession. To take the 
  scabs by surprise we climb the stairs quietly, and then we open the door with 
  a start, yelling and whistling in unison. The most common thing shouted, distinctly 
  and with feeling, is &#8220;Vultures!&#8221; In a few offices, hoping to remain 
  hidden, the employees are in the dark, but one blow from our whistles is enough 
  to scatter them like roaches discovered in the light. They congregate in small 
  groups in front of the main door where two police commissioners are standing. 
  We are all singing the &#8220;Ballad of Pinelli&#8221; (an anarchist murdered 
  by the police in &#8216;69) and &#8220;Calabresi Assassin&#8221; (the police 
  chief accused of killing him).</p>
<p class="subtitle">DECEMBER 5 (Friday)</p>
<p>Yesterday the police attacked the picket line in Milan, and here at Arese the 
  response is slow in coming and inadequate. Today the workers read in the paper 
  that some one at the Portello plant was hit in the face with a police rifle 
  during an attack, and as they enter the plant angered by this news, they see 
  a huge union sign announcing &#8220;two hours of strike with a march around 
  the cafeteria&#8221;. By now the union has shown clearly that it prefers the 
  in-plant processions to be &#8220;just walks&#8221; and not &#8220;scab hunting,&#8221; 
  some tactic! The police are attacking and we&#8217;re walking around the cafeteria 
  like asses! At 9 o&#8217;clock, when the two-hour strike begins, only two comrades 
  from AA need step out of the procession that more than a hundred workers immediately 
  follow suit and go hunting for scabs in even the smallest and most remote departments 
  in the factory. During the afternoon, a few of us find out that in one of our 
  departments five workers are scabbing. A special issue of Pasquino is prepared 
  identifying the five scabs and promising &#8220;Pasquino will strike again!&#8221; 
  (Pasquino is a news sheet which appears on the walls all over the plant, in 
  the most unlikely places: the departments, the toilets, the cafeteria, and so 
  on &#8212; and always when least expected. No one knows who writes it, but everyone 
  fears it, and in this struggle it has become like the sign of Zorro. The Pasquino 
  which named the five scabs had a devastating effect: For two hours they were 
  booed and hissed at, and they didn&#8217;t even have the guts to walk away; 
  they were overcome with shame.</p>
<p class="subtitle">DECEMBER 9 TO JANUARY 9</p>
<p>As we look over our notes we see that between December 9 and January 9 the 
  struggle remained even but uneventful. Among other things, this month has been 
  full of holidays and the rate of absence in the plant has been very high. During 
  the Christmas holiday, for example, many workers took special leave or sick 
  days. There were days when the plant was operating with only 50% of the employees. 
  The strikes continued at a steady but sluggish pace an hour or an hour and a 
  half almost every day, like a drop in the bucket of the bosses&#8217; profits 
  preventing the re-launching of production, but at the same time demoralizing 
  the workers. A number of workers (and not only we of the AA) have understood 
  that to really resist means to break the plans of the State boss, to prevent 
  &#8216;Papa&#8221; IRI, the State holding company, from doing as it pleases. 
  These workers were by our side as we hunted down the scabs, as we marched in 
  the picket lines, as we held discussions and denounced the political line of 
  the unions and the C P, for whom the workers&#8217; struggle is only a tool 
  to blackmail the Government. For them, doing politics means telling the assholes 
  in power: &#8220;You see, this little flame might become a big fire if we weren&#8217;t 
  here to control it, so you better give us what we&#8217;re asking for.&#8221; 
  We in the plants are on to this little game and have had enough of their bullshit; 
  more and more workers begin to understand and organize.</p>
<p class="subtitle">JANUARY 10 (Monday)</p>
<p>Finally we have a breakthrough, like a reawakening after a long slumber. The 
  in-plant processions at the Portello plant this morning were aggressive and 
  combative. With renewed militance the marchers spilled over into the streets 
  surrounding the plant and blocked traffic for miles. Inside the plant the second 
  shift formed an internal procession to prevent overtime work from 5 pm on, and 
  it too blocked incoming traffic at the factory&#8217;s Gate Number 3.</p>
<p>At the Arese plant, a general assembly is held at 8:30 am. The union (FIOM) 
  official speaks and proposes the usual two and a half hour strike. The entire 
  company of Workers boos and hisses, and he is forced to step down. Then a comrade 
  from AA takes the mike and calls on the workers to join hands and occupy the 
  plant, urging that the situation is ripe for such action. Everyone applauds 
  enthusiastically while the FIOM official tries in vain to regain control of 
  the assembly. A comrade from the PCIs Communist Youth Federation who has co-operated 
  closely with the AA takes the mike and proposes that the highway used to move 
  the finished products from the plant be blocked until 3 pm. The assembly approves 
  unanimously and as the workers begin filing out to plan the action the FIOM 
  official manages to get hold of the mic. Amid the confusion, he starts his oration 
  to the effect that we must stay within certain limits (Which?) not allow certain 
  minorities to take over the struggle, and so on. But by now over half the workers 
  are gone, and when only a fourth of them are left the &#8220;fireman (someone 
  who clamps down on working class self-activity)&#8221; re-proposes the limited 
  strike action with an in-plant procession. He asks for a show of hands, and 
  about 30 votes &#8220;yes&#8221;. Without any further ado he declares that the 
  proposal has been accepted and closes the meeting with a historic phrase: &#8220;The 
  workers&#8217; assembly is sovereign!&#8221;</p>
<p>In the meantime the workers from the second shift are blocking the highway, 
  proving they don&#8217;t give a damn about the union&#8217;s directives. There 
  are about 3,000 workers, and the line-up of stopped cars extends for many miles. 
  The FIOM official is going around the plant saying that tomorrow we&#8217;ll 
  block the factory exits where the products are shipped out. (It&#8217;s like 
  saying: &#8220;Listen, boss, tomorrow I&#8217;m going to steal your cows.&#8221; 
  So he has the time to hide them. In fact during the nightmare, cars will be 
  shipped out from the plant.) He is also saying that the night shift should go 
  on strike, while Management is asking in all the departments who wants to work 
  the night shift, emphasizing the overtime pay. This society leaves hundreds 
  of workers at home, while in both big and small plants those who work are forced 
  to put in overtime, work night shifts, and tolerate speed-ups. It&#8217;s a 
  society based on profit, and therefore on exploitation. It&#8217;s nothing new. 
  But let&#8217;s not just cry over it like the unions; let&#8217;s get on with 
  demolishing it.</p>
<p class="subtitle">JANUARY 12 (Wednesday)</p>
<p>While at the Arese plant the blocking of all plant exits continues to prevent 
  finished cars from leaving the production areas, at the Portello plant an assembly 
  is called for 9 am in the cafeteria. The level of participation is high, not 
  to say total. There are 2500 to 3,000 workers, and the level of militance is 
  high. As soon as the FIOM official takes the mic, the hissing indicates that 
  the workers want two things: the in-plant procession and the blocking of the 
  highway traffic. The official tries to stall for time, proposing a simple strike 
  until 11 am, but the hissing gets louder. He tries to explain that blocking 
  traffic is a way of giving in to provocation, but they won&#8217;t let him go 
  on. Next he proposes a strike until 12, but the assembly shouts that that isn&#8217;t 
  long enough. At that point another FIOM official takes the mic and says that 
  the nature of the strike action was decided yesterday by the executive: until 
  12 pm and with no outside procession, but if the assembly feels it is necessary, 
  a brief march outside the plant can be held.</p>
<p>A huge procession forms, and after cleaning out the whole factory marches out 
  the factory gates on to Viale Scarampo, one of the most deserted streets of 
  Milan. As it moves along, already considerably dampened by the &#8220;fire men&#8221;, 
  it passes in front of the hospital for the terminally ill, where a funeral procession 
  is forming. At that point the pace of the workers&#8217; march really slows 
  down and looks like part of the funeral. As the procession cuts through a side 
  street, the banner of the delegates&#8217; council which had been leading ends 
  up in the rear. As we reach Via Trevino the police are waiting in a scissor 
  formation. The workers begin chanting &#8220;Fascists, sellouts, servants of 
  the boss!&#8221; while the scissor breaks in two under the impact of the forward-pressing 
  procession. The police are forced to retreat as the workers continue shouting, 
  while the trade unionists form a cordon to protect the police from the workers! 
  A few punches fly between the more combative elements in the workers&#8217; 
  ranks and the union &#8220;firemen&#8221; who accuse them of wanting confrontation 
  and acting as provocateurs. (As if the police, parked in front of the factory 
  gates every day, aren&#8217;t a permanent provocation.) At any rate, the police 
  get back on their trucks and the procession returns to the plant. Having forced 
  the police to retreat is a major victory. And the unions have shown their true 
  colors: The useless assembly which lasted over one hour, the procession at the 
  rear of the factory, the fear of confrontation with the police as If the workers 
  were the kamikaze attack against the vanguards, the constant appeal to the executive 
  as the only seat of decision making power, the class struggle waged in white 
  gloves, all these are different forms of the same coin, of the same old union 
  tactic. It ignites the struggle just enough to maintain credibility, but is 
  always ready to throw water on it as soon as the pressure from the base threatens 
  to undermine its control of the situation.</p>
<p class="subtitle">JANUARY 14 (Friday)</p>
<p>During the evening we receive news that Frank Atzeni, a comrade from AA, has 
  been suspended indefinitely, and as usual the accusations against him have been 
  brought by a certain Calabritto of the personnel office. Frank is one of the 
  more active and dedicated comrades in the AA, and he has struggled hard in the 
  past few days against the problem of the night shift. As soon as the word starts 
  spreading that he has been suspended, his fellow workers spontaneously put down 
  their tools. Later in the evening, a meeting is held in the office of the FIM 
  (the Christian Democrat metal workers&#8217; union), and a new orientation for 
  the struggle emerges: occupation of the factory.</p>
<p class="subtitle">JANUARY 15 (Saturday)</p>
<p>Even though it is Saturday and we&#8217;re not working today, picket lines 
  form from 6 am on at both the Arese and Portello plants to prevent overtime 
  work. At Arese, the 6 am picketers relieve those who have been there throughout 
  the night making sure no finished vehicles leave the production area. Later 
  in the morning we of the AA meet to examine the situation, and we decide to 
  support the occupation proposal because of several new factors:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>(1) During the past week the struggle has been more aggressive and incisive. 
    Even though the union has been trying to &#8220;put out the fire&#8221;, several 
    things have shown the willingness of the workers to fight: the clash with 
    the police, the spontaneous strikes around the problem of the night shift 
    initiated and conducted by the workers themselves, the immediate response 
    to every attempt aimed at dividing the ranks. After two and a half months 
    of struggle, the working class is very definitely off its knees.</p>
  <p>(2) The union has had to recognize that it can&#8217;t impose light or diluted 
    strikes, and that at this point we must take the bull by the horns. It is 
    significant, for example, that the union (FIOM) official who has always clashed 
    with Frank Atzeni is now openly in favor of the occupation.</p>
  <p>(3) The struggle has shifted, now more than ever before, from the level of 
    mere demands (the contract) to a more political level (the repression of &#8220;Papa&#8221; 
    IRI and the renewed attempt to align those companies having partial State 
    ownership with the Right&#8212;wing forces in power).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The occupation of the factory would function as a reference point for other 
  struggles. Sine 1947, there has been no occupations of major plants except in 
  instances where bankruptcy was shutting them down. The union knows that in the 
  face of badly stalled negotiations and the suspension of Frank Atzeni, the working 
  class will act forcefully and autonomously. It therefore decides to take charge 
  of the situation if only to avoid the embarrassment of being sidestepped. In 
  fact, in the afternoon meeting of the executive, when the occupation is formally 
  proposed, the FIOM official immediately comes out in support of it and urges 
  a series of actions such as open dialogues with the democratic parties and other 
  popular forces, meetings with municipal authorities, dialogues with other delegates&#8217; 
  councils and factories, and so on. Any decisions, however, are postponed until 
  tomorrow, when the full factory executive will meet.</p>
<p class="subtitle">JANUARY 16 (Sunday)</p>
<p>The delegation returns from Rome, where the negotiations between the Government, 
  the unions, and the company have been stalled for some time. It explains in 
  an &#8220;open&#8221; executive meeting that there have been no further negotiations, 
  but only a &#8220;series of meetings&#8221; which apparently haven&#8217;t resolved 
  a thing. The company insists that the proposed automatic passage from category 
  to category would injure the workers in the higher categories, and will only 
  agree to automatic passage from Category 1 to Category 2 in order to eliminate 
  the most glaring cases of discrimination. On this point the company is intransigent. 
  In Rome, therefore, nothing worth mentioning has happened, but the delegation 
  insists that there hasn&#8217;t been a breakdown in negotiations, just a &#8220;postponement&#8221;. 
  What, pray tell, is the difference, with the negotiations &#8220;postponed&#8221; 
  now for over two months?</p>
<p>The problem remains about what to say and what to do in the factory tomorrow. 
  As soon as the local FIOM official begins to summarize the consensus which emerged 
  from yesterdays executive meeting (occupation of the factory), the regional 
  representative of the FIOM, who is higher up in the hierarchy, says: &#8220;The 
  occupation of a factory is a serious thing not to be taken lightly. We can&#8217;t 
  just improvise and risk falling into adventurism. We must be disciplined.&#8221; 
  (Any discipline, it seems, is the responsibility of the working class.) &#8220;If 
  we occupy, many of the workers who do not favor automatic passage will go home. 
  Beware of spontaneism. We have no right to decide.&#8221; (False democratism, 
  since when the base push for something in the delegates&#8217; council, they 
  are told that the final decision belongs to the executive.) &#8220;We must move 
  gradually. Tomorrow we can begin with an extra few hours of strike, and then 
  we&#8217;ll convene the delegates&#8217; council, and after that, other meetings 
  with the democratic parties, telegrams to. . . (etc., etc.).&#8221; This is 
  a typical &#8220;fireman&#8217;s operation&#8221; from beginning to end. There 
  is even one official from the FIOM who pretends not to know what the word &#8220;occupation&#8221; 
  means. According to him, we&#8217;re all supposed to remain in the plant and 
  work to show the bosses that we can work without them. Incredible! The local 
  FIOM official who had come out in favor of the occupation does an about&#8212;face. 
  The problem for the union is clearly not that of giving a militant outlet to 
  the struggle, but rather that of holding it back so that it doesn&#8217;t explode 
  and make a mess. What prevails, then, in the executive, is the idea of having 
  a general assembly tomorrow morning, maybe an all day strike; then, Tuesday, 
  the delegates&#8217; council meeting, then the meetings with other factories 
  with possible demonstrations, then maybe a quick trip to Rome with a lot of 
  fanfare, then a demonstration in front of the mayor&#8217;s office, et cetera, 
  et cetera. In short, there is just so much &#8220;political tourism.&#8221; 
  At this point, however, we must simply wait and see what the workers think of 
  it tomorrow.</p>
<p class="subtitle">JANUARY 19 (Wednesday)</p>
<p>Today, with strikes between 9 and 11 am, several in-plant assemblies have been 
  called for the office personnel at the Portello plant. In one of these, at which 
  I am present, a comrade from AA takes the floor and insists on two themes which 
  we consider crucial: the suspension of Frank Atzenl, and the occupation of the 
  factory. Atzeni must be re-instated, says the comrade, because he has always 
  been in the forefront of the struggles. By striking him the company has struck 
  all of us in the front lines. (Something a line comrade of Frank told me about 
  him comes to mind: &#8220;Frank is worth more to us than a good agreement, and 
  not just for reasons of friendship. We know that with him in the plant we&#8217;ve 
  won; without him even the best agreement would be a defeat, because we would 
  be more vulnerable: The bosses could strike us too the minute we raise our heads.&#8221;) 
  The comrade then touches on the idea of the occupation as a &#8220;political 
  moment which unites&#8221;. The occupation would help us feel more united and 
  part of the same struggle. It would allow us to discuss general political questions, 
  to meet with militants from other plants and hear about their own struggles 
  firsthand. This assembly with the office personnel was really instructive. It 
  showed that there are many people who are uninformed and never discuss political 
  matters, but who as soon as they begin to form clear ideas, are right there 
  with you in the struggles.</p>
<p class="subtitle">JANUARY 31 (Monday)</p>
<p>The unions have been systematically downplaying the idea of an occupation, 
  saying that at the most we should have a &#8220;symbolic&#8221; one which lasts 
  only one day. Meanwhile Frank Atzenl has been re-instated, and this is no doubt 
  a significant retreat for the company and is greeted by the workers as a great 
  victory. This morning the AA distributed a leaflet at both the Portello and 
  Arese plants. It tries to clarify the nature and importance of the proposed 
  occupation, and celebrates the re-instatement of Frank Atzeni.</p>
<p>At the Arese plant the workers are really pissed off when they learn that there 
  will be only one hour of strike to hold the general assembly. The assembly begins 
  at 9 am, and there are tons of participants. When the FIOM official begins to 
  speak you can sense the tension among the workers: The assembly feels like a 
  bomb ready to burst. The official is explaining in minutest detail the negotiations 
  in Rome; he obviously wants the whole hour to go by without giving the workers 
  a chance to take the floor. But after half an hour a restless murmur can be 
  heard which gets louder by the minute, and someone yells out that the meeting 
  should be prolonged till 11. The official agrees, but rather haphazardly and 
  with little conviction in his voice.</p>
<p>The workers insist that the meeting be officially prolonged, and as the official 
  continues repeating himself, stalling for time, a comrade from the AA suddenly 
  jumps up on the platform and yanks the mic away from the trade unionist. The 
  bureaucrats immediately turn down the volume so no one can hear a thing. Hell 
  breaks loose as the workers begin to boo and hiss and yell out insults. Another 
  FIOM official intervenes and tries to throw water on the flames, but almost 
  immediately a few comrades from the AA take the floor and the occupation proposal 
  is accepted by the assembly. It will be discussed again tomorrow in the delegates&#8217; 
  council, but the occupation looks like a sure thing at this point.</p>
<p>Also at the Portello plant the general assembly is very stormy. At 9 am, as 
  I enter the cafeteria, people are bargaining on the table with their silverware, 
  shouting and jeering. Many have read the morning papers and know that the negotiations 
  are still stalled. As soon as the union official starts talking about the Rome 
  negotiations, the assembly explodes and everyone starts yelling &#8220;Occupation, 
  occupation!&#8221; The official is losing his temper, but tries to regain control 
  of the situation by proposing a regional strike, or even a national one, of 
  all the metal workers, with a train ride to Rome, but the hissing continues, 
  and he finally agrees to an occupation, but &#8220;just for one day&#8221;. 
  The reaction of the workers, who immediately answer &#8220;two, two, three, 
  three&#8230;&#8221; makes him realize that he&#8217;s fast losing his grip on 
  things and losing face besides. He then says that meetings will be held in each 
  department to consider the occupation further, with the results to be made known 
  at the delegates&#8217; council meeting tomorrow. At 10:15, an assembly is held 
  which includes around 200 office workers, among whom are many habitual scabs. 
  An FIOM official reviews the results of the Rome negotiations. A comrade from 
  AA takes the occasion to clarify once again the strategic significance of the 
  occupation: more militant struggle and a completely open factory. At 1:30 people 
  are gathering in front of the cafeteria and talking about the way the meetings 
  went in the departments. All the comrades are elated, on all the separate assemblies, 
  including those of the office personnel; the occupation proposal has been accepted, 
  in many cases unanimously. It seems that the idea has really caught fire, and 
  everyone is discussing it as if it were an accomplished fact. Organizational 
  details are being considered, such as constant vigilance against fascist reprisals, 
  coordination of initiatives inside and outside the plant, and so on. It almost 
  seems like something too big and too good to be true, but if the union tries 
  again tomorrow to pull back it will be completely discredited in the eyes of 
  the workers.</p>
<p class="subtitle">FEBRUARY 2 (Wednesday)</p>
<p>At the Portello plant picket lines are set up from 7 to 10 am. At Arese strikes 
  are on from 2:30 to 4:30. People are talking about the occupation as if it were 
  starting today. Since 7:30 the commission nominated yesterday at the Portello 
  plant has been meeting to study the details of the occupation. As soon as the 
  discussion focuses on the length of the occupation there is immediate polarization: 
  on one hand the bureaucracy of the CP and the unions who fear the difficulties 
  which might arise if the &#8220;day of struggle&#8221; is prolonged throughout 
  the night, and therefore propose that It run from 7 am to 11 pm; on the other 
  hand the comrades from AA, other comrades, and the FIM, who want the occupation 
  to begin today and end at 9 am the day after tomorrow. The discussion gets rather 
  heated; the FIOM is even afraid of the word &#8220;occupation&#8217; and prefers 
  to refer to the event as &#8220;a permanent assembly in control of the factory&#8221;. 
  When one of the comrades says something about the workers becoming &#8220;owners 
  of the factory&#8221;, the bureaucrats jump on him with words like &#8220;extremist&#8221; 
  and &#8220;provocateur&#8221;.</p>
<p>The FIOM insists that the occupation can&#8217;t begin today because it would 
  give the company a pretext for a lockout. In reality, it wants to keep itself 
  within the rules of the Union-boss game; it only trusts top-level negotiations, 
  and does not want to present itself at the bargaining table in Rome tomorrow 
  with the factory already occupied. By 11:30 word arrives that many workers in 
  the departments and offices want to occupy immediately! In many offices, the 
  managers are going around asking the personnel to take holiday time or special 
  leave for tomorrow. They also announce that all services in the plant will be 
  suspended. The commission finally reaches a compromise, and the occupation is 
  scheduled to begin at 9 am tomorrow and last a full 24 hours. At 2:30, an assembly 
  is held at the Arese plant to inform the workers of the decision. The FIOM official 
  chooses his words with such skill that his climb up the union ladder is virtually 
  assured. He says that the decisions of the delegates&#8217; council must be 
  respected (the assembly is no longer sovereign) and that caution must be exercised 
  not to allow lapses into spontaneism, adventurism, extremism, and so on. A comrade 
  tries to interrupt, but the bureaucrats from the CP who are guarding the microphones 
  say &#8220;Let him be; he&#8217;s the usual extremist; a minority of one.&#8221;</p>
<p>At the Arese plant, the FIOM official clarifies to the assembly that we are 
  having not an &#8220;occupation&#8221; (God forbid!), but rather a &#8220;permanent 
  assembly&#8221;. Occupation or no occupation, the strong picket lines continue 
  at the point of finished production, the most vulnerable place for the boss. 
  The workers know what they&#8217;re doing. In the evening the company advises 
  the union brass that since they have behaved so &#8220;responsibly&#8221;, tomorrow 
  will be considered a regular work day and everyone will get paid. The game is 
  fully within the rules: &#8220;I could kill you if I wanted to, but I&#8217;ll 
  only hurt you a little, and in return, boss, you&#8217;ll give me a little something.&#8221; 
  This is the union, the champion of the march in reverse! It is so good at balancing 
  the accelerator and the brakes that it always finds an &#8220;authorized parking&#8221; 
  space. Born from the factory vanguards, the idea of the occupation was at first 
  snubbed by the union, then fought against, and finally, because the mass of 
  workers wanted it, approved, but only in order to immobilize it.</p>
<p class="subtitle">FEBRUARY 3-4 (Thursday and Friday)</p>
<p>Portello: There is a general assembly at 9 am, and absolutely everyone is present, 
  even those who have never been on strike before. It is the highest point of 
  the struggle so far. Those participating in the assembly Include politicians, 
  trade unionists, and various political groups. There is even the CP, which as 
  usual expresses its solidarity, leaves a $160 check (disgusting!), and splits. 
  Even a representative from the Italian Socialist Party arrives, says a few words, 
  and leaves without even sitting down, a formality like cutting an inaugural 
  ribbon. If this goes on much longer the assembly is going to become a nice little 
  stage on which everyone, from revisionists to bosses, can parade before the 
  workers.</p>
<p>At the gates there are workers who &#8220;guard the factory&#8221;. In reality, 
  all gates have been shut down except Gate 5, which the workers have blocked 
  with huge metal barrels, and Gate 1, because the union said the executives have 
  to come and go unmolested. The militants decide who enters and who leaves. The 
  bureaucrats from the CP and the FIOM union try to let in only the people and 
  the groups, they approve of, but we do exactly the same. As far as the students 
  are concerned, the CP had tried to limit their participation to only three delegates 
  from the student movement of Milan State University. We forced them, however, 
  to admit three delegates from each factory. The morning is fast coming to an 
  end, and we&#8217;re getting fed up with all the big shots that speak and then 
  leave. We propose that the assembly break up into smaller groups which can study 
  specific issues more carefully, and proceed to form a group of about a hundred 
  which sets up its own agenda. A few minutes later, a few bureaucrats arrive 
  and with great alarm announce that all the executives have left the plant (isn&#8217;t 
  that what we wanted?), that Alfa had discontinued all services (cafeteria, guards, 
  and so on), and that we must ask all students to leave immediately.</p>
<p>What is really bothering them is that many have by now left the general assembly 
  to join small discussion groups. There is real mass participation on the part 
  of workers and office personnel, and it is really an occupation now that all 
  the executives have abandoned ship and the factory is in the hands of the workers, 
  who are guarding the gates vigilantly to prevent any fascist attacks. Contrary 
  to the bureaucrats&#8217; expectations, everyone has remained in the factory, 
  preferring to participate in group discussions and aware that this new form 
  of struggle is a demonstration of the strength of the working class. After a 
  short break to grab a sandwich, the general assembly and the discussion groups 
  reconvene for the afternoon. On the lower floor of the cafeteria a study group 
  with about a hundred people is formed. Several issues are tackled from the special 
  problems of office personnel to the repression inside and outside the plant 
  to the line of the CP and the current move to the Right by the Government. This 
  was a lesson for the CP and the unions which tried to de-emphasize the political 
  value of the occupation and had brought in only those people they approved of. 
  (In the morning, for example, they had refused to give the floor to a group 
  of militants from &#8220;Il Manifesto&#8221;.) Around 7 pm the union wants to 
  close the plant to all outsiders, but the decision is made to allow workers 
  from other factories to enter until 10 pm. Many people have gone home for the 
  night, and the few hundred who remain are organizing the roster for guard duty 
  throughout the night. While all the main gates continue to be picketed, inside 
  the plant there is constant surveillance in all the departments, and outside 
  there are groups of militants in cars controlling all people who look suspicious. 
  At one point, two men in a car are stopped and asked for their IDs. They really 
  look suspect, and turn out to be two cops who hang around the area until 5 am. 
  A few of us go to sleep on desks, while others, better organized, have brought 
  their sleeping bags. Even the back seat of a car is fine enough when you&#8217;re 
  really sleepy, and we&#8217;re all dead tired and very cold. At the gates huge 
  bon-fires are burning to keep those outside warm.</p>
<p>Arese: The day of occupation of the factory: The security arrangements are 
  handed over to an FIOM official who is careful not to give us of the AA the 
  red armbands identifying all those involved in keeping order. With or without 
  armbands, we&#8217;re on the picket lines. There is a happy atmosphere because 
  the plant is in the hands of the workers, who are singing songs of struggle 
  as they make the rounds in the various departments. Throughout the morning delegations 
  from political parties, municipal governments, other factories, and student 
  groups enter the plant. The cafeteria is not in service, and by 2 pm we&#8217;re 
  all starving. Many have left to have lunch at home or at a nearby restaurant, 
  and will return later in the afternoon. The militants from &#8220;Red Rescue&#8221; 
  bring some wine, and around 2:30 some 3,000 sandwiches arrive, compliments of 
  various neighborhood co-operatives.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting parts of the day was the performance given by Dario 
  Fo&#8217;s La Comune, a radical theatre group. The mimic, Vidal, showed the 
  alienation that workers undergo in capitalist society, and did a mimic drama 
  about the demise of the present society. The show was widely understood and 
  enthusiastically applauded by the workers. We sang songs of struggle led by 
  Paul Ciarchi (also of La Comune) until 1:30 am. When revisionism was attacked 
  throughout the evening, you could see the bureaucrats squirming in discomfort. 
  Finally some of us went to sleep and others went to picket the finished-products 
  gate. If asked for a general assessment of today&#8217;s occupation, we would 
  have to say that it wasn&#8217;t all we had hoped it would be, but at the same 
  time it did contain some very positive things. Above all it was a victory snatched 
  from the unions by the workers at the base, and even in the way it was conducted, 
  the unions were prevented from turning it into a platform for political parties 
  and &#8220;big shots&#8221;. We were successful in bringing into the plant workers 
  from other factories, students from many schools, and militants from a variety 
  of political groups dealing with the unions from a position of power.</p>
<p class="subtitle">FEBRUARY 12-13 (Saturday and Sunday)</p>
<p>Thursday night a few workers tore out the train tracks running through part 
  of the factory grounds to prevent a train with 250 finished cars from leaving. 
  The union issued a communiqu&eacute; which was picked up by Saturday charging 
  that forces &#8220;external&#8221; to the factory were responsible for this 
  &#8220;typically fascist&#8221; action. It was the union&#8217;s way of attacking 
  the workers who insist that the picket against the finished products must continue 
  at all costs because it is the only form of struggle which is hitting the company 
  in the guts. (The dealers, both domestic and foreign, are pressuring for cars.) 
  Already, a few days ago, a contingent of 200 police managed to get eight trucks 
  (carrying about 60 new cars) safely out of the plant gates, and the union said 
  not a word. This evening (Saturday), while we of the AA are in a meeting, a 
  few comrades arrive from Arese and explain that police reinforcements are on 
  their way to the finished products picket area and are planning to help the 
  train get by the picket lines, since the tracks have been repaired. We leave 
  immediately for the Arese plant, where on arrival we find over 1,000 policemen. 
  We&#8217;re not sure whether they&#8217;ll try to get the train out or whether 
  they&#8217;ll use the trucks.</p>
<p>About 1:00 am, 30 trucks appear outside the gates. (At 7 pm about a dozen of 
  them had entered through another gate, and the police themselves had loaded 
  the cars onto them!) We start talking to the truck drivers: &#8220;Our struggle,&#8221; 
  we say, &#8220;is your struggle too. You are exploited just like we are. If 
  you go in, all our sacrifices to maintain the picket of the finished products 
  day and night will go up in smoke. After more than an hour of discussion, they 
  are persuaded, and refuse to enter the gates. A squad of policemen, stationed 
  inside, went to the gates and tried to get rid of a group of comrades who are 
  seated on the ground near the gates. They shout &#8220;Rauss just like the Nazis.&#8221; 
  They say their job is to ensure respect for the law and the right to work, and 
  that if we don&#8217;t move they will drag us away. One of them, who is asked 
  by a comrade if he has the proper authorization, answers that he doesn&#8217;t 
  give a damn about authorization, and that they themselves are the only necessary 
  authority. They bellow orders to the truck drivers to come forward, but the 
  drivers don&#8217;t move. The officers are foaming with anger as the drivers 
  openly defy them. After 10 minutes they retreat into the plant, closing the 
  gates behind them.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, other comrades arrive after being notified of the emergency situation. 
  (Even a CP senator showed up, but after looking around a few minutes, he left.) 
  A comrade from Quarto Oggiaro had phoned everyone from his home phone, and by 
  some strange coincidence the police blocked all the roads leaving Quarto Oggiaro. 
  His phone was clearly being tapped. But our chief pre-occupation is the train: 
  Now that the tracks are in good repair, it won&#8217;t be so easy to stop it. 
  At about 3:30 am all the police take their positions, and after opening the 
  gates they let out 10 trucks carrying about 75 cars. The police are brandishing 
  their rifles and using them to keep back the workers who are pressing forward 
  and yelling &#8220;Fascists, fascists!&#8221; to the passing truck drivers. 
  A few of the cops look stoned and unsteady, and their faces are angry and full 
  of hate. There are too few of us to resist effectively, but we manage to put 
  it over on the pigs anyway. While a large group of us create an incident to 
  cause commotion and keep the police busy, a smaller group quietly sneak over 
  to an area where the trucks will be passing to leave the grounds. They succeed 
  in damaging nearly all the cars on the last five trucks by throwing stones. 
  The police are really embarrassed, and the truck drivers who had remained outside 
  now realize that it would be Impossible to drive out with undamaged cars for 
  the rest of the night. The policemen who escorted the truck drivers out of the 
  factory gates are now clashing with a group of comrades near the exit. They 
  wait for one of the trucks to barely inch forward, and then charge the workers. 
  We return to the drivers to warn them that if they don&#8217;t clear out, the 
  responsibility for what might happen will be on their shoulders. After about 
  five minutes they leave, and not long after the police leave also. With 30 trucks 
  and a train, they could have carried off about 500 vehicles. As things turned 
  out, they took out only 75, and more than half of them were damaged. Despite 
  the grand display of police power, out of all proportion to our meager numbers, 
  we managed to win a victory (a) because we were able to persuade the truck drivers 
  to come over to our side, and (b) because the police never thought that we could 
  get so many comrades over to the Arese plant on such short notice.</p>
<p class="subtitle">FEBRUARY 18 (Friday)</p>
<p>Portello: This morning the delegates&#8217; council held a meeting at which 
  the FIOM official explained the text of the agreement finally reached this week 
  in Rome. The &#8220;automatic passage&#8221; is there, but in name only. Strong 
  limitations are built into it: There are more than four levels, because within 
  the first level there are those who never go on to the second, and within the 
  second and third there are discriminatory criteria between workers, not to mention 
  the fourth level, which retains a coefficient amounting to another level.</p>
<p>For the office employees, there is precious little of what they wanted. The 
  union talks about &#8220;areas to be delimited&#8221; in connection with passage 
  from the second to the third, perhaps with the help of a special commission 
  which, when translated, as we all know, means: postpone the problem until there 
  is no more mass mobilization, so that the company has a chance to maneuver however 
  and whenever it wishes. The only new thing: a $72 bonus for everyone, including 
  the scabs. The PCI, with a triumphant tone, celebrates the contract by declaring 
  it &#8220;a great victory&#8221;, but then someone points out that the automatic 
  passage is a farce, that the levels are more than four, and that the office 
  employees have gained nothing. There is an air of general dissatisfaction, but 
  the unions are saying that we can&#8217;t go on with the struggle, that the 
  working class is tired, and that therefore the agreement should be accepted 
  as it stands. Even we of the AA know very well that after 150 hours of strike 
  the struggle has come to an end, but we are not afraid to say that the agreement, 
  far from being a great victory, is a bitter disappointment, especially for the 
  office personnel.</p>
<p class="subtitle">FEBRUARY 21 (Monday)</p>
<p>Portello: There is a general assembly in the cafeteria from 10 to 11 am. Everyone 
  is there; workers, office employees, about 3,000 people. The FIM official goes 
  over the main points of the agreement. He goes on and on for over half an hour 
  and soon mumbling and restless whispering can be heard all over the hall. Finally 
  he says: &#8220;Now we will vote, a mere formality, but let&#8217;s see: Who&#8217;s 
  In favor of the agreement?&#8221; About 60% raise their hands amid shouts and 
  jeers. People are yelling &#8220;Sellouts, clowns&#8230;&#8221; For a further 
  demonstration of support the union official asks slyly: &#8220;Those who favor 
  continuing the struggle raise your hands.&#8221; Despite this formulation (many 
  of course object to the agreement but prefer not to continue the strike) about 
  40% raise their hands. The shouting grows more insistent, but the official declares 
  with a perfectly straight face &#8220;The overwhelming majority approves of 
  ending the struggle!&#8221; and then makes a quick exit. The shouting and hissing 
  continues as members of the CP brass stand there at a loss for words. They don&#8217;t 
  have the courage to engage the workers in conversation as the assembly breaks 
  up into smaller groups to discuss the agreement and the manner in which the 
  assembly was held. Many ask why no separate department meetings were held. Others 
  say that if the automatic passage isn&#8217;t reached with this agreement, the 
  struggle will go on and set off a chain of wildcats in every department. These 
  who are talking are not from the ranks of the vanguards, but just ordinary workers 
  from the base. Especially among the office employees dissatisfaction is high, 
  and it will be important to avoid a swing to the right. We&#8217;ll have to 
  push hard for autonomous organizing at the level of the base. After the meeting 
  is closed, a group of office employees come over and ask if they can join the 
  AA because they&#8217;ve decided not to renew their union membership. We explain 
  that the AA has no formal membership, but that they are welcome to the AA meetings 
  any time. </p>
