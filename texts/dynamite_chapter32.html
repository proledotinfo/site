<p align="center" class="title">SABOTAGE AND STRIKING ON THE JOB</p>
<p align="center" class="author"> Selections from Chapter 32 of "Dynamite: the 
  Story of Class Violence in America"<br>
  by Louis Adamic (1930)</p>
<P> In 1920, following my discharge from the Army, I became, under bread-and-butter 
  compulsion, a young working 'stiff' (I was just 20) with no particular trade. 
  For several months I hung around the employment agencies - the 'slave market' 
  in Chicago. There I met a couple of rather articulate IWW members who, seeing 
  that I was a young ex-soldier, palpably 'on the bum' and a 'scissor bill' with 
  a radical trend of mind, set out to make me into a class-conscious proletarian, 
  a wobbly. They urged me to give up all ideas of ever being anything else than 
  a working stiff for the chances of my becoming a capitalist or a bourgeois, 
  in however modest a way, were extremely slender, indeed, almost nil. I was a 
  foreigner and the number of opportunities was decreasing rapidly even for native 
  Americans. I should make up my mind to remain a worker and devote such abilities 
  as I had to the hastening of the decay of the capitalist system, which was doomed 
  to collapse, they said, within a very few years whether I joined the IWW or 
  not.
<P>I learned of the methods by which, it appeared, sooner or later the workers 
  would attain to power and abolish capitalism and wage slavery. At first I did 
  not understand everything I was told. The wobblies used a word - sabotage - 
  which, as I recalled, I had read some time before in Frank Harris's Pearson's 
  Magazine without knowing its meaning. At the public library I did not find it 
  in the dictionary. Then, in a dingy IWW reading room I came upon a little book 
  entitled Sabotage, written originally in French by Emile Pouget and translated 
  into English by Arturo Giovannitti, in 1912, while he was in jail at Lawrence, 
  Massachusetts, on framed-up charges for his part as a wobbly leader in the famous 
  textile workers' strike. There I found sabotage defined as:
<BLOCKQUOTE> any conscious or wilful act on the part of one or more workers intended 
  to reduce the output of production in the industrial field, or to restrict trade 
  and reduce profits in the commercial field by the withdrawal of efficiency from 
  work and by putting machinery out of order and producing as little as possible 
  without getting dismissed from the job.</BLOCKQUOTE>


<p>The book was a sort of wobbly gospel.</p>
<p>In the same reading room I found pamphlets in which sabotage was discussed 
  from the ethical point of view. A wobbly writer described it as a 'war measure' 
  in the conflict between the capitalist class and the working class, and in war 
  everything was fair and moral. The wobblies admitted that sabotage on the part 
  of the workers was no goody-goody method, but defended it on the ground that 
  it certainly was no worse than the methods to which the capitalists were resorting 
  in the economic warfare. If the workers, in their efforts to gain economic advantages, 
  damaged property and destroyed materials, did not the bosses, in the interest 
  of profits, destroy property with a ruthless and careless hand? Have they not 
  laid waste the country's national resources with utter lack of consideration 
  for their human values - forests, mines, land and waterways? Did they not dump 
  cargoes of coffee and other goods into the sea, burn fields of cotton, wheat 
  and corn, throw trainloads of potatoes to waste - all in the interest of higher 
  incomes? Did not millers and bakers mix talcum, chalk and other cheap and harmful 
  ingredients with flour? Did not candy manufacturers sell glucose and taffy made 
  with vaseline, and honey made with starch and chestnut meal? Wasn't vinegar 
  often made of sulphuric acid? Didn't farmers and distributors adulterate milk 
  and butter? Were not eggs and meat stored away, suffering deterioration all 
  the while, in order to cause prices to rise?</p>
<p>All of this, the wobblies insisted, was sabotage, just as their doings were 
  sabotage; the ethical difference between the worker and the capitalist with 
  k their respective forms of sabotage was that the former was open and honest 
  about it, and the latter dishonest, practising destruction secretly, under the 
  guise of business, the while condemning proletarian saboteurs as criminals.</p>
<p>There was another difference. The wobblies preferred that property should not 
  be destroyed; indeed, they were more jealous of its preservation than the capitalists, 
  for at the basis of their philosophy was the idea that the property belonged 
  to them. It was their - the workers' -creation; some day it would be theirs 
  by right of possession; and until that day it should be preserved for them.</p>
<p>These things were openly discussed by the wobblies in meetings, newspapers 
  and conversation. They didn't care who knew that they believed in and practiced 
  sabotage. Some of them were veritable evangelists of sabotage, for they saw 
  it as almost the only means - but a powerful one - whereby the cause of the 
  underdog could be advanced. One of my wobbly friends said, in effect:</p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Now that the bosses have succeeded in dealing an almost fatal blow 
  to the boycott; now that picket duty is practically outlawed in many sections 
  of the country, free speech throttled, free assemblage prohibited and injunctions 
  against labor are becoming epidemic - now sabotage, this dark, invincible, terrible 
  Damocles' sword that hangs over the head of the master class, will replace all 
  the confiscated weapons and ammunition of the workers in their war for economic 
  justice. And it will win, for it is the most redoubtable of all, except for 
  the general strike. In vain will the bosses get an injunction against strikers' 
  funds, as they did in the great steel strike - sabotage, as we practice it, 
  is a more powerful injunction against their machinery. In vain will they invoke 
  old laws and make new ones against it - they will never discover sabotage, never 
  track it to its lair, never run it down, for no laws will ever make a crime 
  of the 'clumsiness and lack of skill' of a scab who bungles his work or 'puts 
  on the bum' a machine he 'does not know how to run', but which has really been 
  'fixed' by a class-conscious worker long before the scab's coming on the job. 
  There can be no injunction against sabotage. No policemen's club. No rifle diet. 
  No prison bars.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<p>It was some time before I realized how effective - and significant -sabotage 
  really was.<BR>
</p>
<p class="subtitle">2</p>

<p>Through a Chicago employment agency I found pick-and-shovel work on a long-time 
  construction job outside of Joliet. I was one of perhaps a hundred muckers, 
  among whom, as I soon discovered, were also several wobbly sabotage evangelists. 
  "Take it easy, kid", one of them said to me smilingly the second or third day. 
  "Don't try to build the road in a day. T' hell with it! You're getting the same 
  as me, three fifty a day, ain't you? Well then, don't work as if you were getting 
  thirty-five." 1 had been working steadily, and this not because I wanted to 
  see the road finished as soon as possible, but because, not having worked for 
  months, and being plagued by some sort of blues, I thought that a few months 
  of real work would toughen me up physically and otherwise. But now as the wobbly 
  prophet of sabotage called me down for working too fast, I blushed - without 
  knowing why. I became self-conscious.</p>
<p>For days the man kept close to me, continuing to urge me to slow down. "Put 
  the brakes on, kid", he would say. Or, "Go take a sip of water". Or, "Say, don't 
  you think it's about time you went to the can again?". Or, 'Tomorrow's another 
  day, boy".</p>
<p>Then we would have long conversations, while he pretended to be digging beside 
  me; he had stalling down to a science. He evidently was a well-read, self-educated 
  bozo; and when I revealed to him that I was a fan of such writers as Upton Sinclair 
  and Frank Harris, and was interested in the Russian revolution, he told me about 
  the IWW movement, and about 'Big Bil’' Haywood and William Z Foster who, in 
  1912, had attended an international labour congress in Europe and brought back 
  to America the French ideas of sabotage which since then have been considerably 
  improved by the rank and file of the wobblies. He was a self-appointed apostle 
  of sabotage, with a surprising gift of gab, going from job to job, making wobblies 
  of scissor bills, teaching them what he called "the technique of stalling". 
  He taught me the technique. He said: "Don't take so much on the shovel, kid. 
  Don't break your back. Which reminds me of what a bunch of stiffs did down in 
  Bedford, Indiana, back in 1908, when the boss told 'em their wages were cut. 
  They went to a machine shop and had their shovels shortened, and said to the 
  boss, 'Small pay, small shovel'. They had the right dope. That was a kind 0' 
  instinctive, spontaneous sabotage; though sabotage, I mean the word, was then 
  unknown in this country. That still holds good - 'small pay, small shovel'. 
  You get three fifty; do you think that's all your labour is worth? Don't be 
  a fool. So give 'em a small shovel; when nobody is looking, no shovel at all. 
  T’'hell with 'em! Stall - strike on the job. Savvy?"</p>
<p>I found stalling, even after I had more or less mastered the technique, harder 
  than real work, but my instructor derived a deep satisfaction from it. He encouraged 
  me, saying that by and by l should get used to it.</p>
<p>Originally - back in 191 2 and 1 91 3 - the wobbly idea was to damage the machinery 
  just before going on strike, so that the scabs could not use it; but by 1920 
  the IWW and the communist agitators, who then began also to play an important 
  role in the drama of sabotage in American industry, commenced to 'fix' machines 
  while the work went on. On the road building job I worked on near Joliet the 
  foreman had trouble every few days with the concrete-mixers, trucks and steam 
  shovels. Suddenly things would break down in the middle of the forenoon or afternoon, 
  whereupon 10 or 20 men stood around idle while the mechanics repaired them. 
  My friend the wobbly winked at me meaningfully, smiling. In the evening while 
  we walked about he told me about sabotage stunts in which he had participated 
  or of which he had heard.</p>
<p>One day he said: "I guess I'm a short-timer on this job. Did you notice how 
  the old Irish buzzard" - meaning the foreman we worked under -"watches me all 
  the time the last few days? They're getting wise to me; maybe one of the stiffs 
  that I've tried to educate told them what my religion is." He smiled "I'll be 
  fired in a day or two. But what the hell! I'll be on another job in a week, 
  doing the same thing."</p>
<p>The next day he and three other men, also wobbly sabotage apostles, were paid 
  off and cautioned to stay away in the future; But before they went I learned 
  that the two miles of concrete road we had laid in the past month and a half 
  would be full of wide cracks in a few weeks. They had put something in the cement 
  that would cause it to crack and the contractor would have to do it all over 
  again. I stayed on the joliet job another month, long enough to see the concrete 
  crack; then, with mid-summer near, I went on to St Louis with two young IWW 
  who were confident that there we should have no difficulty getting work as harvest 
  hands in the Missouri and Kansas wheat fields.</p>
<p>In St Louis the 'slave market' was also full of wobblies. They were all a rather 
  jolly, if somewhat lopsided lot, aflame with a sort of fanaticism tempered with 
  good humour. I heard the story (which I later verified) of an incident that 
  occurred one winter before the first world war when the city was full of starving 
  and freezing unemployed workers who had come in from the camps and fields. The 
  wobblies decided to force the city to take care of them one day several hundred 
  of them invaded the restaurants, ordered big meals, ate, and then presented 
  their checks to the cashiers, telling them to charge them to the mayor. Arrested, 
  they made speeches in court that broke on the front page. The town got excited 
  over the prospect of thousands heading for St Louis to eat at the mayor's cost 
  - for that was just what they did, out of jail or in. The city council then 
  hastily passed an emergency bill to start municipal houses with free beds and 
  meals. The 'stunt' was a form of sabotage on the community, dramatic and humorous, 
  which, frankly, appealed to me.</p>
<p>Indeed, not a few wobblies with whom I came into contact, though intensely 
  serious, were genial, amusing and intelligent fellows, quite frank about their 
  ideas and doings. They were freelance missionaries in the cause of the underdog 
  to whom the end justified the means, with the self-imposed duty td harm the 
  propertied classes as much as, and whenever, possible: guerrilla soldiers in 
  the class war.</p>
<p>In the Kansas wheat fields, where I worked for several weeks in the summer 
  of 1920, there was much stalling or striking on the job, and the threshers and 
  other harvest equipment would break down in the midst of our work, when every 
  hour counted to the farmer. Some 30 miles away from where I worked, a wheat 
  field nearly a mile square burned up. It created somewhat of a sensation in 
  our camp. The wobblies I knew, most of them fairly level-headed stiffs, seemed 
  opposed to fire and blamed the stunt on the communists, who were much more drastic. 
  There were stories among the IWW that the communists in the United States had 
  orders from Moscow to sabotage American industry. These stories probably were 
  based upon a confidential circular said to be 'unquestionably authentic' - but 
  which in all likelihood wasn't-which the United States department of justice 
  'discovered' and published at that time, and in which some 'executive committee 
  in Moscow urged its representatives abroad, among other things to instigate 
  general and particular strikes, injure machinery and boilers in factories, and 
  do everything possible to disorganize capitalist industries.</p>
<p>There can be little question that, early in the last decade, communists in 
  the United States engaged in such doings; only, let me hasten to say, there 
  was and is no connection between them and several communist movements now existing 
  in this country. Most American communists at that time were various kinds of 
  dissenters from the IWW, none of whom would now have any connection with communism.</p>
<p>Regular leaders of conservative unions issued warnings to the strikers to steer 
  clear of ultra-radical agitators. Even so, during the 1920s and '30s sabotage 
  and striking on the job became a part of the psychology and action of millions 
  of American workers who would resent being called wobblies or communists.</p>
<p class="subtitle">3</p>
<p>Late in 1921 1 found myself in the east again. Unable to get work ashore, I 
  went to sea and during the next year sailed on five different American ships, 
  on all of which I encountered sabotage, both among the sailors, wobbly and non-wobbly, 
  and the officers (though, of course, the latter would not have called their 
  doings sabotage).</p>
<p>As a messboy I saw wasted or thrown overboard thousands of dollars' worth of 
  food supplies and as a seaman tens of thousands of dollars' worth of paint and 
  ship's equipment. I met wobblies on every ship and made friends with some of 
  them. One of them, I remember, once said to me: "The American underdog is getting 
  wised up and so is the American underling; I mean the small-time bosses and 
  overseers, like the officers on a ship. They're beginning to realize they're 
  underpaid and they act accordingly. I've been going to sea now for 15 years 
  and, if I know anything - and I consider myself a pretty smart guy - there is, 
  for instance, more graft, petty graft, on American ships than ever before. As 
  you know, stewards ruin food and dump it overboard so that when they get into 
  port they can order more provisions and collect a small commission on the purchase 
  from the provision house The same is true of mates, engineers and masters. On 
  some ships I've been on the whole gang of them was in cahoots, selling great 
  big coils of expensive Manila rope in foreign ports or rolling them overboard, 
  throwing over whole cans of ship's paint and so on - so that they could order 
  more rope and paint, and collect cumshaw."</p>
<p>On a ship on which I made a round trip from New York to the Pacific coast the 
  fo'c's'le was almost 100% saboteur - and some of the men had scarcely heard 
  of lWWism. The wobblies had what at least they deemed a high social motive when 
  they preached and practiced sabotage; the non-IWW saboteurs, however, seemed 
  to be just in an ugly mood and derived a mean personal satisfaction when, instead 
  of washing a paint brush, they tossed it over the rail or threw whole bucketfuls 
  of paint into the sea. There was no shipmindedness. "To hell with 'er!" was 
  the motto. "To hell with the owners!" We discussed the graft that the skipper, 
  the chief engineer, the mates and the steward were pulling down each trip. I 
  was told that on the second previous voyage the captain and the engineer had 
  fixed up the engines so that the vessel had to be laid up in a San Pedro, California, 
  shipyard for three weeks for $23,000 worth of repairs, for which they collected 
  a bonus from the shipyard's agent.</p>
<p>I found out that lWW and other saboteurs aboard ships often helped officers 
  do their dirty work, and with great gusto. I recall that once, when one of the 
  mates ordered a group of us sailors to throw over the side a slightly damaged 
  oil hose nearly 50 feet long and worth several hundred dollars, because the 
  skipper did not want to bother making out a report to the home office the way 
  it had been damaged, most of us laughed; it was a joke on the company - "to 
  hell with it!"</p>
<p>An IWW sailor, perhaps the most intelligent worker I ever met, said to me once 
  when we discussed sabotage on the ships:</p>
<BLOCKQUOTE>You sea in the magazines that the United States is having great difficulties 
  in establishing a merchant marine of any consequence because in America shipbuilding 
  costs exceed those elsewhere; because American investors would expect a larger 
  return on capital invested in shipping than foreign companies make, and because 
  the wages of American crews are higher than those paid by the lines of other 
  countries - with the logical result, so they say, that the American freight 
  and passenger rates must be higher, and consequently shippers find it advantageous 
  to deliver their goods in foreign bottoms I'm no high-powered executive, only 
  a fo'c's'le stiff; but I know enough to realize that all these alibis are only 
  superficially true; the last alibi, perhaps, not even superficially. In point 
  of fact, American officers and men do receive higher wages than the ships' crews 
  of other countries except Canada; but in relation to the wages ashore American 
  crews are hardly as well paid as the Japanese. And, to my mind, therein lies 
  one of the primary causes of the sad state of the American merchant marine. 
  The American go-getter in the shipping business, as his brothers in other lines, 
  is stupidly greedy; for those who, caught between the circumstances of their 
  environment and their own innate qualities and shortcomings, are compelled to 
  sell him their brains and brawn, he usually has small consideration and rewards 
  them as meagerly as he can manage for all the effort he can exact from them 
  - with the result that in the long run his slaves get back at him, some of them 
  through conscious sabotage, such as our lWW sabotage, which nibbles away at 
  the vitals of the capitalist system; others, half-unwittingly, through sabotage 
  which has no social aim and is purely personal revenge, but which blindly attains 
  the same purpose - hastens the decay of the system. It is true that the so-called 
  maintenance of American ships is higher than of most foreign ships, but that 
  is solely because the crews don't give a damn for the ships or the owners and 
  willfully waste. I don't doubt but that more is wasted on American ships than 
  the shippers manage to get out of the government in subsidies.</BLOCKQUOTE>


<p>A few months after he had said this to me -- it was in 1922 - my wobbly sailor 
  friend and I signed on the Oskawa at Philadelphia. She was a United States shipping 
  board freighter, 6100 gross tons, built in 1 91 8 at a cost of nearly two million 
  dollars and equipped with an up-to-date refrigeration system. We sailed to Hamburg 
  with a small cargo. The trip there was uneventful. The crew was the usual crew 
  that one found on American freighters, perhaps a little worse. The half dozen 
  wobblies I found in the fo'c's'le unquestionably were the best men aboard. The 
  skipper was an old man, not in the best of health, somewhat bewildered by his 
  responsibility. The mates, engineers and the steward were a collection of bleary-eyed 
  'lime-juicers' and overbearing 'squareheads', licensed during the war emergency 
  when almost anybody could have obtained a ticket. There was much drunkenness 
  and brawling, along with poor navigation. In Hamburg we picked up an enormous 
  cargo of champagne and liqueurs for South America. Then, four or five days after 
  leaving Germany, bottles began to pop in the officers' rooms and the mess-rooms; 
  finally' even on the bridge and in the chart-room, and cases of the marvelous 
  liquids found their way into the crew's quarters.</p>
<p>The old skipper - feeble and unresourceful character that he was, scared of 
  his own authority, befuddled by endless shipping board regulations and the Seamen's 
  Act, afraid of legal trouble which would entail making all sorts of reports 
  at which he was not clever - was beside himself. The second mate was the only 
  other officer who kept sober. The ship was thrown off her course several times; 
  but, finally and miraculously, thanks in part perhaps to the six or seven IWW 
  who stayed sober and helped the skipper to run the boat, she reached Brazil.</p>
<p>The cargo discharged, it was discovered that the Oskawa was short over 100 
  cases of champagne, kummel and other fancy hooch. The old man, of course, knew 
  what had become of the stuff; but, nearly the whole ship being in a sort of 
  conspiracy against him, he was unable to locate a single case aboard or prove 
  anything against his officers. He signed for the shortage, to be made good by 
  the ship. He looked around both in Rio de janeiro and Montevideo, but realized 
  that he could not pick up any better officers and crew in South America, even 
  should he be so fortunate as to rid himself of his present gang.</p>
<p>The Oskawa's cargo on the return trip to Hamburg was about 1000 tons of frozen 
  meat.</p>
<p>A day or so out, the champagne bottles that they had hidden away began to pop 
  once more in the officers' rooms and on the bridge. Most of the officers became 
  openly hostile to the captain, who was at his wits' end. He carried a gun and, 
  in his futile way, threatened to arm a few sailors, including myself and three 
  of the lWW, whom he considered loyal.</p>
<p>One day someone fed too much oil into the furnaces, and the fire blazed out 
  of the funnel, belching burning oil all over the ship. The fire destroyed or 
  damaged a good part of the upper structure, including most of the lifeboats, 
  the bridge and the chart-room; indeed, it was sheer luck that the sober part 
  of the crew -- mostly IWW - managed to extinguish it. "We'd let 'er burn", said 
  the wobblies, "if it weren't that we'd go to hell with 'er".</p>
<p>But the worst was yet to come. While still several days from Hamburg, the engineer 
  burned out the dynamos, so that for the rest of the voyage the Oskawa was without 
  lights and there was no more cold air for the refrigerator pipes. Indeed, to 
  the great menace of other ships on that course, part of the time she sailed 
  at night without running lights. We used oil lamps, which, however, were little 
  better than nothing; and one night the first mate, too drunk in his bunk to 
  raise himself and put out the light, kicked the lamp over and we had to put 
  out another fire.</p>
<p>Then, instead of pumping the bilges, one of the men pumped out nearly all the 
  fresh water! There was enough left for drinking but none for the boilers; so 
  we were compelled to use salt water for steam, with the result that presently 
  the valves were choked with salt. We had to stop every few hours to clean them 
  out.<BR>
  We were about a day off Madeira when the Oskawa's engines went out of commission 
  entirely. We drifted a night and a day while the machinery was being sufficiently 
  repaired to enable us to limp into Madeira, in which port, however, there were 
  no facilities for any extensive repairs, and we procured only water and a few 
  more lamps and some oil for the running lights. The dynamos, it appeared, were 
  totally ruined.</p>
<p>The refrigeration system was not working, the frozen meat began to melt and 
  smell; whereupon, to make a good job of it, someone - I suspect one of the IWW 
  - shot steam into the refrigerator pipes, with the result that before it was 
  discovered much of the cargo was cooked or otherwise spoil it.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the wobblies laughed among themselves, figuring how much the United 
  States government would have to pay for the ruined cargo.</p>
<p>Somewhere off the coast of Holland, the fuel oil supply suddenly gave out, 
  and we had to be towed into Hamburg, where the investigations that followed 
  nearly drove the master out of his mind. At the end he was exonerated and some 
  of the officers were jailed and deprived of their licences. The Oskawa was sufficiently 
  repaired to be taken back to the United States and there put in the 'boneyard', 
  where there already were hundreds of other ships in no better condition!</p>
<p>One of my IWW friends aboard said to me, "They couldn't have done a better 
  piece of sabotage even if everybody from the skipper down had been a wobbly 
  or a communist. Hallelujah!".</p>
<p class="subtitle">

  </p>
<p>The Oskawa incident which, by the way, is a matter of record in Washington 
  and also received considerable attention in the Hamburg press at the time, as 
  well as some slight mention in the American newspapers -disgusted me utterly 
  with sailoring and so I began to earn my living ashore again. From 1 923 to 
  1927 I worked on dozens of jobs all the way from Philadelphia to Los Angeles 
  - in steel, furniture, shoe and textile factories, on farms and ranches, in 
  restaurants, in a stone quarry and a printshop, in a grocery store and an automobile 
  plant, on construction jobs, on docks unloading ships - and practically everywhere 
  I found some form of sabotage. Nowhere did I find any real zest for work, any 
  pride in work.</p>
<p>in a furniture shop in Cleveland, where I managed to get a job as a carpenter's 
  helper, I found cliques of workers organized to help one another in working 
  for themselves in the boss's time, making parts out of the boss's material, 
  then smuggling them out under their clothes in the evening, and finally assembling 
  them at home into chairs and cabinets, either for sale or for their own use. 
  In a lace mill near Scranton, Pennsylvania, where I worked for a while, I found 
  the operatives, especially the men, in a bad mood. The management was speeding 
  up the machines, forcing the employees to work faster and faster for the same 
  pay, with the result that there was much sabotage on the machinery. Looms were 
  injured; on the large machines leather bands were cut with safety razor blades. 
  The foreman blamed these things on "those communist bastards". On several of 
  the cut leather bands one morning 'Sacco-Vanzetti' was inscribed in white chalk.</p>
<p>I worked in three or four restaurants in New York and Pittsburgh and encountered 
  sabotage in at least two of them. In one place a communist dishwasher before 
  quitting poured several cans of kerosene into barrels of sugar and urinated 
  into containers of coffee and tea. I imagined that he went from job to job doing 
  this sort of thing.</p>
<p>In New York I met another communist, a handsome red-headed young Irishman, 
  whose special racket was to work on soda-fountains in the garment making sections 
  and serve his communist friends, whom he counted by the score, expensive milk 
  drinks and fancy sandwiches for which he handed them nickel and dime checks 
  to pay the cashier. When he was discovered and discharged he found himself another 
  job in the Bronx or Brooklyn near some factory employing great numbers of communists.</p>
<p>In a print shop in Kansas City the workers, instead of distributing expensive 
  type, dumped it into the so-called 'hell box'. A printer friend of mine who 
  has worked in big and small shops, union and non-union, all over the country, 
  tells me that the hell box is still a very popular receptacle for type. Few 
  printers nowadays retain any love for fine type or good workmanship.</p>
<p>In a shoe factory in Milwaukee a man was pointed out to me who was known among 
  some of his fellow workers to be a saboteur. An eccentric-looking person, he 
  hated the machines and had all sorts of devices to damage them. He was an indefinite 
  sort of radical, and he considered the machines a great curse to humanity. I 
  have encountered this hate for machines elsewhere. People vent it in various 
  forms of sabotage, which has no connection with lWWism or communism, but is 
  purely a matter of personal resentment and vindictiveness. I have seen people 
  who - sometimes drunk, sometimes sober - cursed the machine and, passing by, 
  shook their fists at the mills, declaring they were not their slaves. Every 
  big industrial town seems to have 'nuts' who believe that machines are alive 
  and hold them - the workers - in their power.</p>
<p>Shortly after the war I read I forget where - about an American soldier who 
  believed that machines were killing people in revenge for the work that they 
  were made to do. "Stop the machines", he would cry, lying wounded in a hospital, 
  "and there'll be no more war. Machines make war - machines kill us!".</p>

<p>During the 1 920s big and bitter union upheavals were comparatively few in 
  the United States, but the struggle of the have-nots against the haves went 
  on unceasingly and relentlessly just the same; only now it was no longer open 
  warfare. On the surface things were quiet, but underneath the workers were being 
  infected with the germs of sabotage and striking on the job.</p>
<p>As a result of the employers' anti-union drives, the anti-red hysteria,marked 
  by such incidents as the Centralia trial and the Sacco-Vanzetti affair, and 
  the unionists' and radicals' inability to "match the industrialists' brains 
  and weapons in open warfare, there was no effective organized radical movement 
  in the last decade. There was, however, a vast unorganized radical movement, 
  including millions of workers outside the unions and the socialist and communist 
  parties, skilled and unskilled. They were left to their own devices to improve 
  their lot in life and revenge themselves upon the system which used people only 
  when their toil might bringp rofits for an employer, let them starve (unless 
  they turned bootlegger or criminal) when there was a surplus of production, 
  and utterly discarded them when they became old. After the suppression of the 
  organized radical movement in 1922 or thereabouts, there was perhaps as much 
  radicalism among American workers as ever before, only now it found scarcely 
  any vent in organized open political or industrial action as it had 20 years 
  ago, or even in the few years immediately after the first world war. The workers' 
  radicalism now found individual, personal expression in doing as little as possible 
  for the wages they received and in wasting as much material as possible. Their 
  radicalism now lacked all social vision and purpose; its motive was mainly personal 
  revenge.</p>
<p>This sort of radicalism continued into the 1930s. Workers were cynical. The 
  motto in a factory where I once worked was: "To hell with 'em all but six; save 
  them for pallbearers!" The more intelligent workers had no faith in politics. 
  They sneered at the Socialist Party, especially those who had witnessed at close 
  range the futile tactics of its leaders. They had no faith in trade unionism; 
  most of those who belonged to the unions belonged because they must; because, 
  for the time being, the unions still controlled certain jobs. They knew their 
  leaders were crooked. I have heard members call their officials crooks from 
  the floor in meetings and refer to their organizations as rackets. They had 
  no faith in a better future for themselves as a class, while at the same time 
  they felt that they were stuck - that most of them were fated to remain workmen 
  till they got too old to work. They knew that the system was unjust to them; 
  they had been told so by numberless red agitators and demogogues, past and present. 
  They realized that most of their class movements, industrial and political, 
  in the past had been largely ineffectual. They knew that the cause of low wages 
  was a surplus of workers and that unemployment, which hit them every once in 
  a while, was due to overproduction. And so, logically enough from their individual 
  points of view, they struck on the job and wasted the bosses' time and material, 
  thereby stretching out, as they felt, their spell of employment and diminishing 
  the profits of employers, who, they believed, underpaid them.</p>
<p>This went on, more or less, as I have hinted, throughout industry, even where 
  the IWW, who developed striking on the job and sabotage tactics in America, 
  had never been strong (except, of course, in the great plants with the speed-up 
  system, such as the Ford factories, where the motions of every worker were purely 
  mechanical, prescribed by the management, and the foreman saw that a worker 
  executed them with the required result). Early in the summer of 1930, for instance, 
  the organized cafeteria owners in New York City and Brooklyn gave out the information 
  that saboteurs among their employees wasted or destroyed from one to two million 
  dollars' worth of food a year. The working class had been driven to sabotage 
  by greed on the part of the industrialists. When the IWW took it up, it was 
  about the only effective weapon left to the underdog. Then the wobblies lost 
  control of it and sabotage lost its social vision and purpose. The advocates 
  of sabotage had turned loose in the community a force which they could not check 
  and whose consequences were far beyond their intention.</p>
<p>Some employers, trying to combat sabotage, hired spies whom they paid more 
  than regular workers, and whose business it was to spot strikers on the job 
  and saboteurs and get them eliminated and blacklisted. But this, I think, was 
  combating one evil with another, which produced a third and even greater evil. 
  With spies in the factories, the workers distrusted one another, each believing 
  that the other was or might have been a spy. This played the devil with the 
  men's sense of honour. It tended to make 'heels' and 'sneaks' of them. I know 
  of cases where workers practiced sabotage upon one another, 'framing' their 
  fellows in order to get their jobs or gain other advantages. I know of a case 
  where a man was beaten up by his fellow workers who believed him to be a spy. 
  He happened not to be one.</p>
<p>Also, spies often encouraged sabotage; or, rather, detective agencies which 
  specialized in saboteur spying frequently slipped saboteur instructors into 
  the factories as workers. These taught the other employees subtler means of 
  sabotage and soldiering, so that the detective whom the employers hired to watch 
  the workers might have something to report. Thus, in some cases, the industrialists 
  were quite helpless in the face of sabotage and striking on the job.</p>
<p>Sabotage and striking on the job are forms of revenge that the working class 
  in America - blindly, unconsciously, desperately - exacts for the employers' 
  relentless, brutal opposition to its strivings in the past -revenge for the 
  Ludlow massacre, for the Mooney-Billings frame up, for the Centralia injustice, 
  for the Sacco-Vanzetti horror, for the cossackism in the steel strike.</p>
