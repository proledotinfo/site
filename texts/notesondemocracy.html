<p class="title">Notes On Democracy</p>
<p>Democratic ideology essentially contains two sort of the illusions:</p>
<p>1. The idea that under all circumstance the morally superior way of making 
  decisions is having some sort of electoral participation by the majority.<br>2. 
  The idea that the method of decision making is what distinguishes different 
  sort of social system.</p>
<p>These illusions have many forms and are interrelated. Mainstream American democratic 
  rhetoric justifies political decisions by the use of both elections and polls. 
  It is &quot;very democratic&quot; in the sense that the passive choices of the 
  majority can change the form that the American repression and exploitation take.</p>
<p>Worker's self-management is a more obscure form of this illusion which claims 
  that the changes in the way a factories' decisions are made will change the 
  form that an entire society will take. It's basic position is summarized in 
  the sticker that calls for workers to &quot;fire&quot; their bosses, and apparently 
  continue production in the same old way.</p>
<p>It is important for revolutionaries to oppose both versions of democratic ideology. 
  On one hand, after a revolution there certainly won't be any reason to fixate 
  on the process of reaching each decision. For example, one person could be assigned 
  to decide a day's delivery schedule in a communal warehouse without oppressing 
  the other workers - who might prefer to spend their time walking on the beach. 
  This dispatcher would have no coercive power over the other participants in 
  the warehouse and deciding the schedule would not give her power that she could 
  accumulate and exchanged for other things. For their own enjoyment, the worker 
  might on the other hand want to collectively decide the menu of a communal kitchen 
  even it was a less efficient use of time.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it's important to realize that no scheme for managing society 
  will by itself create a new society. Highly democratic, highly authoritarian 
  and mixed schemes are now used to administer capitalism. The basic quality of 
  this capitalism that the average person has little or no control of their daily 
  mode of living. Wage labor dominates society. You must exchange your life to 
  buy back your survival. Whether the average person under capitalism might somehow 
  be able to make a large of decisions about which records they buy, which inmates 
  serve long sentences, what the color the street lights are, etc. is irrelevant.</p>
<p>The community that escapes capitalism will involve people effectively controlling 
  their process of living. This the individual and collective refusal of work, 
  commodity production, exploitation etc. This certainly will require a large 
  amount of collective decision making and a large amount of individual decision 
  making. The transformation cannot be reduced to a set way of making decisions 
  or a fixed plan of action.</p>
<p>The different modes of living are easier to describe using Marxian terminology 
  sometimes because it speaks in terms of social processes rather than atomized 
  individual actions. The economy is both a way people make decisions and a way 
  people act. You can only see the real conditions of society by looking at the 
  conditions of daily life - how a society's mode of existence reproduces itself. 
  This is summarized fairly well using the Marxian terms of political economy, 
  spectacle, commodity etc.</p>
<p>All forms of democratic ideology appeal to a model of human behavior that implies 
  each person is wholly separate social agent that only affects others in fixed, 
  definable ways. This is the language of &quot;common sense&quot; in a world 
  where people's senses are controlled by capitalism. It defend the right, for 
  example, for a man to shout cat-calls at woman who has previously been raped 
  because that man's actions are simply &quot;free speech&quot; not connected 
  to any social action.</p>
<p>Communist positions see a social web which to not reducible to a fixed number 
  to definable relations. Communists do not say that without capitalism we can 
  guarantee that humans will create a human community. It says with capitalism, 
  humans cannot create a human community. It sees that any movement for a human 
  community will oppose capitalist social order and social relationships all along 
  the way. The motivating force will not come with a communist blue-print but 
  from the process of living of proletarians creating a new social relation. </p>
