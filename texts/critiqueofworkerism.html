<p class="title">WORKERISM</p>
<p class="author">by Wildcat (UK)</p>
<p><br>
  Workerism is a form of capitalist ideology that is endemic amongst self-defined 
  revolutionaries.</p>
<p>It is an ideology that encourages the acceptance of, and propaganda for wage-labour, 
  amongst individuals who have realised the exploitation and alienation that wage-labour 
  entails.&nbsp; It is thus one of the highest forms of alienation.</p>
<p>Worship of the worker is found in various state ideologies, such as Stalinism 
  and Nazism.&nbsp; Workers are honoured for their role as builders of the nation, 
  the economy, capital.</p>
<p>Workerism is not an ideology that praises all wage labour, but one that promotes 
  only &quot;productive&quot; labour.&nbsp; It in fact vilifies office workers 
  and service industry workers and praises only those who are most closely involved 
  in the reproduction of capital.</p>
<p>Workerism worships&nbsp; manual labour, the &quot;work with hammers&quot;.&nbsp; 
  Its vision of the proletarian is of the muscle-bound male.&nbsp; In rejecting 
  office and shop work, it rejects a large part of female wage-workers, revealing 
  itself as sexist.</p>
<p>Workerism has been present in the workers' movement from the beginning.&nbsp; 
  The earliest workers societies were Christian inspired, and praised diligence 
  thrift and hard work.&nbsp; These moralistic ideas linger on in workerism, which 
  is a remaining bastion of Christian ideology within the working class.&nbsp; 
</p>
<p>The strongest proponents of workerism are not manual workers who have had no 
  choice in their labour, but ex-marginals who make a moral decision to become 
  a &quot;revolutionary&quot; manual worker.&nbsp; Their advocacy of workerism 
  is a compensation for their lack of sureness about their own class status, and 
  a moral condemnation of proletarians who are willing to make different choices.</p>
<p>In its theory, workerism sees revolution arising from an escalation of the 
  day to day struggles of workers in capitalism.&nbsp; The history of revolutions 
  contradicts this theory again and again.&nbsp; The French and Russian revolutions 
  were triggered by women's struggles.&nbsp; The German and Portuguese revolutions 
  were triggered by mutinies.&nbsp; The Paris 68 revolution was triggered by a 
  student struggle.&nbsp; Workerism deals with history's falsification of its 
  theory not by correcting the theory, but by the falsification of history.&nbsp; 
  In each case the role played by non-workers is marginalised or denied.&nbsp; 
  Revolutionary theory instead analyses the real events in order to understand 
  the moments of weakness in capitalism.</p>
<p>Productive workers are said by workerists to hold a crucial position because 
  they can, by withdrawing their labour, bring down capitalism.&nbsp; In fact 
  the centrality of productive workers is exaggerated, as production is only one 
  part of the cycle of accumulation.&nbsp; Workers involved in communication, 
  distribution and circulation can also have a powerful lever.&nbsp; A strike 
  of bank workers might have a stronger effect on capital than a strike of workers 
  in a car factory.&nbsp; A wave of urban riots might have a stronger effect than 
  either.</p>
<p>The search for crucial fractions within the proletariat, whose struggle is 
  privileged, reveals a hierarchical perspective held by the workerist.&nbsp; 
  It stems from the view that communism is a program already framed which just 
  needs troops to put it into practise.&nbsp; This outlook is a hangover from 
  antique socialism such as 2nd International style social democracy, or syndicalism.&nbsp; 
  This type of theory sees class struggle as a form of (bourgeois) war, with foot-soldiers 
  and generals.&nbsp; The &quot;revolutionary&quot; determines the programme, 
  the workers put it into practise.</p>
<p>Workerism and intellectualism are opposites but are not opposed.&nbsp; They 
  complement one another.&nbsp; Thought and action are separated, the workers 
  must put the theorist's ideas into practise.&nbsp; Workerists often have their 
  own critique of intellectuals, but this is only to be applied to other intellectuals, 
  not the workerist himself.&nbsp; The workers must shun other intellectuals, 
  but not the workerist, who pretends to be something other than a specialised 
  thinker.&nbsp; Workerism maintains the opposition of thought and action, and 
  the de facto privilege of thought, which are inherent in capitalism.</p>
<p>The revolutionary subject is not just productive workers, or even all workers.&nbsp; 
  It is the proletariat, those without social power or social wealth, those who 
  have nothing to lose but their chains.&nbsp; In addition non-proletarian strata 
  can play a full part in revolutionary situation, if the proletariat is itself 
  active.&nbsp; This is seen best of all in the revolutionary peasants involved 
  in the Makhnovist movement, and in the communist communities set up during the 
  Spanish civil war.&nbsp; </p>
<p>The aim of the communist movement is not a workers' state, or a proletarian 
  dictatorship.&nbsp; It is the abolition of all classes in the human community 
  created through anti-capitalist struggle.</p>

<p><em>This critique of workerism was written in 1995, but previously unpublished. 
  Although we were not workerists as such, there was a tendency in that direction 
  in some of our texts and attitudes so this is in part an self-critique.</em></p>
<p><em>One comment made in response to this text was that there is a reason the 
  workerism &quot;reveals itself as sexist&quot;. Workerism corresponds to a particular 
  composition of capital, where the model family unit consists of a male factory 
  worker and a stay-at-home wife. Workerism is sexist as it corresponds to a sexist 
  (now superseded) composition of capital.</em></p>
