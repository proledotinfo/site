<p class=title>&#8220;Dynamite... That&#8217;s the Stuff&#8221;</p>
<p class=author>Selections from Chapter 2 of "Dynamite: the Story of Class Violence in America"<br>by Louis Adamic (1930)</p>

  -Johann Most</p></blockquote>
<p class=subtitle>Propaganda by the deed </p>
<p>Such European anarchists as Bakunin, Kropotkin and Guillaume, living in London 
  and the Jura, had been keeping their eyes on the United States for years, as 
  a possible fertile field for anarchist propaganda and action. Indeed, Bakunin, 
  upon hearing of hunger parades in New York and elsewhere, was thinking of going 
  to America as early as 1874, but affairs in Europe and his ill health, which 
  presently resulted in his death, kept him from making the trip. Now, in the 
  summer of 1877, receiving reports of the battles in several states, they were 
  all filled, as Guillaume put it, &#8220;with a lively emotion&#8221;. In the 
  Bulletin of the Jura Anarchist Federation, Kropotkin immediately published a 
  lengthy review of the riots. He was enthusiastic in his praise of the &#8220;revolutionary 
  qualities&#8221; which the American proletariat had exhibited. &#8220;Its spontaneity, 
  its simultaneousness at so many distant points, the aid given by the workers 
  of different trades, the resolute character of the uprising from the beginning, 
  call forth our sympathies, excite our admiration, and awaken our hopes&#8221;.</p>
<p>Then, in 1882, Johann Most, a German anarchist, arrived in the United States 
  and became the chief exponent of the ideas of Bakunin, Nechayeff and other European 
  &#8216;propagandists of the deed&#8217;.</p>
<p>But first it is necessary to know something of the radical movement in the 
  United States prior to the riots of 1877. </p>
<p class=subtitle>2 </p>
<p>Modern American radicalism dated from the late 184Os, when the country began 
  to receive numerous political refugees from Europe, especially from Germany, 
  following the upheavals there in 1848. They represented the socialism that was 
  being crystallized in the mighty literary efforts of Marx and Engels. They were 
  not of the underdog element, but rather the &eacute;lite, the intelligentsia 
  of immigration. The movement was intellectual, refined, tame, romantic. It was, 
  for about two decades, a vague expression of a multiplicity of ideas aiming 
  at the introduction of drastic social reforms, the basic one of which was a 
  reconstruction of the economic scheme so that the entire wealth of production 
  should accrue to the producer. They did not mean to abolish capital, but to 
  do away with a distinct capitalist class, though, of course, no one had a plausible 
  notion of how that might be accomplished in the United States. The movement 
  was a babble of voices in which the most strident note was the wail of discontent.</p>
<p>In the 1850s, numerous German-American revolutionary societies and educational 
  clubs were formed in New York City, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Chicago and other 
  large cities, aiming to start a revolution in the minds of the people. Barricades 
  and violence played no part in the thought of the overwhelming majority of the 
  socialists of that day. They were opposed to lawbreaking, holding with Marx 
  and Engels that such tactics were injurious to the cause. After the civil war, 
  and even during that conflict, marxism had begun to appeal - vaguely - to some 
  of the more thoughtful native Americans whose energies were not entirely absorbed 
  by the exploitation of the country and their fellow citizens. Abraham Lincoln 
  himself became - not too publicly, of course - a sort of socialist. Serious-minded 
  people were disturbed by the rise of influences affecting the vitality of the 
  government. As guardians of public order and morality they were also disturbed 
  by influences affecting individual social conscience.</p>
<p>There was little interest in politics and government from the broader viewpoint 
  of social welfare or civic patriotism. Under the sway of the passion for material 
  success which had taken hold of the country, honesty and social intelligence 
  vanished from public life. Honest politicians fled or were driven from official 
  positions. The influence upon the government of one unconscionable millionaire 
  outweighed the votes of a million common people. Except for the frontier, fair 
  play had ceased to be a vital quality of American public life.</p>
<p>All this outraged the sensibilities of many people. Beneath the roar and bustle 
  of industrial America there was an undercurrent of ideas, hopes and fitful strivings 
  to restore the government to social interests and to extend its power for public 
  welfare so as to include the lowest worker.</p>
<p>Throughout the 1860s, socialism remained tamely idealistic, polite, refined, 
  intellectual, almost respectable. Its appeals were not addressed to the underdog 
  element as such, but to all classes. There were a few hotheaded, wild-eyed radicals 
  here and there, but while industrial conditions were yet bearable to the majority 
  of workers and the frontier was still open, they received little attention.</p>
<p>Then, with the panic of 1873 bursting upon the country, there followed the 
  conditions described in the preceding chapter and, almost overnight, the socialist 
  movement lost its genial, intellectual temper. The hunger parades in the terrible 
  winter of 1873-1874 were organized by socialist leaders, both native and foreign-born, 
  and thenceforth socialism was largely - almost exclusively - an underdog, belly-hunger 
  movement. As such, it naturally became emotional and violent. It was seized 
  by the desperation of the hungry mob.</p>
<p class=subtitle>3</p>
<p>The most radical city in the United States in the 1870s and 18805 was Chicago. 
  The Socialist Labor Party of Chicago, whose early career was linked with the 
  bloody events that occurred during the panic, acted under the energetic leadership 
  of such men as Philip Van Patten, Albert Parsons and G A Schilling - strike 
  tacticians and agitators of exceptional ability.</p>
<p>Almost from its inception, the Socialist Labor Party contained an extremist 
  element. From time to time, some of its leaders despaired of accomplishing anything 
  for the working class through politics. They were acquainted with marxist ideas, 
  but they also read Hegel, Kropotkin, Bakunin, Alexander Herzen and Spencer. 
  In addition to the SLP, they were organized in the so-called revolutionary clubs, 
  meeting in secret halls and beginning to despair of starting &#8216;a revolution 
  in the minds of the people&#8217;. Similar clubs appeared in other cities during 
  the panic.</p>
<p>In 1881, a national convention of the revolutionary clubs was held in Chicago 
  and the Revolutionary Socialist Party came into existence, competing with the 
  SLP. For a year and a half the character of this movement was very vague. There 
  was loose talk of violence, dynamite and assassination, but the party as a whole 
  dangled self-consciously between marxism and nihilism, between theory and action.</p>
<p>Then Johann Most came. He was a man in his late 30s, an intense, striking personality, 
  somewhat of a Bakunin even in looks; possessing a fiery intelligence and violent 
  temperament; largely self-educated, dynamic, irrepressible; with a picturesque 
  prison record as a result of his revolutionary doings in Vienna, Berlin and 
  London. In London, on the occasion of the assassination of Tsar Alexander II 
  by the Russian nihilists in 1881, he had published, in his paper Freiheit, an 
  article extolling the act and urging others to do likewise with rulers everywhere. 
  For this he had been sentenced to 18 months of imprisonment. After serving the 
  term he departed for the United States.</p>
<p>In America he was hailed as a hero by the comrades of the revolutionary clubs 
  and became at once the leader of the extremists. His cry was: &#8220;Extirpate 
  the miserable brood!&#8221; - meaning all politicians and exploiters of the 
  masses. He was an avowed, thoroughgoing revolutionary. His principle of action 
  was the Bakuninist principle: &#8220;Let us rely upon the unquenchable spirit 
  of destruction and annihilation which is the perpetual spring of new life. The 
  joy of destruction is a creative joy!&#8221; Most believed in dynamite and street-fighting 
  and, in his contentions with the nonviolent American socialists, made no secret 
  of his belief.</p>
<p>He was a frequent visitor in Chicago, where violent revolutionary doctrines 
  and tactics gained a considerable following among workers and their leaders. 
  Under Most&#8217;s influence, Die Arbeiter Zeitung, a socialist paper, turned 
  out-and-out anarchist. He resumed the publication of his own Freiheit; a group 
  of Czech anarchists began a sheet in Bohemian; and for English-speaking anarchists, 
  Albert Parsons, who, along with many other Chicago agitators, had accepted Most&#8217;s 
  ideas and leadership, edited Alarm.</p>
<p class=subtitle>4</p>
<p>Soon after his arrival in the United States, Most published in New York a booklet 
  entitled Science of Revolutionary Warfare - A Manual of Instruction in the Use 
  and Preparation of Nitroglycerine, Dynamite, Gun-Cotton, Fulminating Mercury, 
  Bombs, Fuses, Poisons, etc, etc. In 1885 and 1886 chapters of the book were 
  reprinted in anarchist sheets in Chicago and Cleveland, which, in addition, 
  carried inflammatory editorials, appeals, and manifestos.</p>
<p>I quote from Die Arbeiter Zeitung: </P
><blockquote><p>  [8 April 1885] Here is something worth hearing. A number of strikers in Quincv, 
  yesterday, fired upon their bosses, and not upon the scabs. This is recommended 
  most emphatically, for imitation. </p>
<p>[5 May 1885] Workmen ought to take aim at every member of .he militia, and 
  do with him as one would do with some one of whom it is known that he is after 
  taking one&#8217;s life. It might then sooner be difficult to obtain murdering 
  tools . . . Workmen, arm yourselves! </p>
<p>[18 March 1886! If we do not soon bestir ourselves for a bloody revolution, 
  we cannot leave anything to our children but poverty and slavery. Therefore, 
  prepare yourselves! In all quietness, prepare yourselves for the revolution! 
</p></blockquote>
<p>And the following appeared in Parsons&#8217; Alarm on 21 February 1885: </p>
<blockquote><p>Dynamite! Of all the good stuff, that is the stuff! Stuff several pounds of 
  this sublime stuff into an inch pipe (gas or water pipe), plug up both ends, 
  insert a cap with a fuse attached, place this in the immediate vicinity of a 
  lot of rich loafers who live by the sweat of other people&#8217;s brows, and 
  light the fuse. A most cheerful and gratifying result will follow. In giving 
  dynamite! To the downtrodden millions of the globe science has done its best 
  work. The dear stuff can be carried in the pocket without danger, while it is 
  a formidable weapon against any force of militia, police, or detectives that 
  may want to stifle the cry for justice that goes forth from the plundered slaves. 
  It is something not very ornamental, but exceedingly useful. It can be used 
  against parsons and things. It is better to use it against the former than against 
  bricks and masonry. It is a genuine boon for the disinherited, while it brings 
  terror and fear to the robbers. A pound of this good stuff beats a bushel of 
  ballots all hollow - and don&#8217;t you forget it! Our lawmakers might as well 
  try to sit down on the crater of a volcano or on the point of a bayonet as to 
  endeavor to stop the manufacture and use of dynamite. It takes more justice 
  and right than is contained in laws to quiet the spirit of unrest. </p></blockquote>
<p>The story of dynamite - the actual &#8216;stuff&#8217; - in the United States, 
  as a weapon of the have-nots in their warfare against the haves, dates from 
  Most&#8217;s arrival in the country.</p>
<p class=subtitle>The Stage is Set</p>
<p>Many of the factors that factors that finally led to the explosion of the Haymarket 
  bomb in Chicago had been in operation long before Johann Most&#8217;s arrival.</p>
<p>The intense public reaction to the Molly Maguire outrages and the riots of 
  1877, as already suggested, had an unhealthy immediate effect upon working class 
  organizations. The few strikes that occurred between 1878 and 1880 were promptly 
  and brutally put down by the police, the militia, and hired gunmen. But the 
  union movement was much too elemental and primal, too powerfully motivated by 
  the belly-hunger of a great mass of people, by the desires of individuals to 
  get on, by the prevalent spirit of America, to be kept down for long by the 
  self-righteous condemnation of the pulpit, the conservative press, the respectable 
  mob at large, or even the police clubs and the fire of the soldiers and the 
  gunmen. The workers&#8217; living conditions became worse. Immigrants continued 
  to pour into the country by the hundreds of thousands every year, expanding 
  the slums working for less than the native workers were willing to take. &#8220;In 
  the cities&#8221;, says Mother Jones, in her Autobiography, &#8220;there was 
  hunger, and rags, and despair&#8221;. </p>
<p>Within a year or two - at any rate by 1880 - it began to appear that the riots 
  and the subsequent reaction, which included the hasty building of new weapon 
  stores and general tightening up of capitalist lines against the working class, 
  had given the wage earners of the country a new and powerful impulse to organization. 
  The fact that whole regiments had been called out to subdue them stirred in 
  the workforce a resentment which began soon to assume vague political aspects 
  and prompted its leaders to think of organizing the unskilled workers whose 
  part in the riots had been so startling and important. </p>
<p class=subtitle>2</p>
<p>Many of the old unions were reorganized and numerous local amalgamations were 
  effected. But the most important working class bodies at that time were certain 
  secret societies whose initiation rites were absurd, fantastic ceremonials conducted 
  by magniloquent officers with high-sounding titles, and whose members recognized 
  one another by elaborate signs and secret passwords. </p>
<p>Of these, the most significant was the Noble Order of the Knights of Labor, 
  founded in 1869 by a Philadelphia garment-cutter, Uriah S. Stephens and six 
  of his fellow craftsmen. Stephens has been described as &#8220;a man of great 
  force and character&#8230; with love of books&#8230; and feeling withal a strong 
  affection for secret organizations, having been for many years connected with 
  the masonic order&#8221;. He had associated with radicals, some of them German 
  refugees of 1848, and from them had acquired a few vaguely socialistic ideas 
  that fitted into his natural but even vaguer humanistic idealism.</p>
<p>The principles of the K of L were set down by Stephens in the secret ritual. 
  &#8220;Open and public association having failed after a struggle of centuries 
  to protect and advance the interest of labour, we have lawfully constituted 
  this assembly&#8221; and &#8220;in using this power of organized effort and 
  co-operation, we but imitate the example of capital heretofore set in numerous 
  instances&#8221;; for, &#8220;in all the multifarious branches of trade, capital 
  has its combinations, and, whether intended or not, it crushes the manly hopes 
  of labour and tramples poor humanity into the dust&#8221;. The K of L, however, 
  meant - timidly, carefully - &#8220;no conflict with legitimate enterprise&#8221;, 
  whatever that was, and &#8220;no antagonism to necessary capital&#8221;. It 
  meant, rather, &#8220;to create a healthy public opinion on the subject of labour. 
  . . and the justice of its receiving a full, just share of the values, . . it 
  has created&#8221;. </p>
<p>For three years the Order was a garment cutters&#8217; club, its membership 
  remaining less than one hundred. In 1872, several ship carpenters, plumbers 
  and other workers were allowed to join, and thereafter it expanded rapidly into 
  a national organization. The secrecy and ceremonials appealed to them and within 
  the lodges were numerous official positions with magnificent titles and uniforms. 
  Grand Master Workman Stephens - for such was his title - declaimed sonorously 
  about &#8216;justice&#8217;, &#8216;the nobility and dignity of labour&#8217;, 
  &#8216;the great brotherhood of toil&#8217; and hinted at the evil doings of 
  the capitalists. But his successor, Terence V Powderly, a machinist by trade, 
  who was elected grand master workman in 1878, cut a still more absurd figure 
  in the national workers&#8217; movement. He excelled even Stephens in vague 
  social idealism, love of abstract words and bombastic oratory. A windbag, a 
  figure of lath and plaster, vain and jealous, loving power, never knowing his 
  own mind, he was blown hither and thither by the force of events. He had an 
  expansive manner and held that &#8216;labour was noble and holy&#8217;, was 
  opposed to &#8216;wage slavery&#8217;, as he boldly called it, but looked with 
  deep disapproval upon the strike as a method to fight it. His ignorance of the 
  forces inherent in modern industrialism was abysmal. He spoke grandiosely on 
  all sorts of subjects, night and day. The man was full of strivings and gropings, 
  a valorous idealist on the platform, but timorous when action was suggested.</p>
<p>The K of L was essentially an assembly of windbags, full of half-hearted revolutionary 
  impulses and crude chicane, affording those like Stephens and Powderly, who 
  loved to hear themselves talk, an opportunity to orate and receive the applause 
  of simple workers, in whose capacity to help themselves as a class they had 
  no intelligent faith. Nearly everything that the K of L achieved in the course 
  of its dramatic career was achieved in spite of its leaders.</p>
<p>During Stephens&#8217; regime the order was entirely secret; not even its name 
  was known to outsiders. Its meeting-halls and gathering places in the forests, 
  and its official announcements in the press were indicated, romantically, by 
  five stars. People would see the mark appear on the door of some auditorium 
  and then hordes of workers would come flocking there. What were they up to? 
  How strong was this mysterious order of the five stars? The conservative, respectable 
  mob, to say nothing of the capitalists, made uneasy by the upheavals of the 
  proletariat in Paris and their famous Commune of 1871, by the Molly Maguire 
  disclosures, and by the riots of 1877, feared that the organization might be 
  dangerous. Suddenly some fateful day a bloody terror might burst upon the country!</p>
<p>Finally, the press and the pulpit began to demand that the ***** come out in 
  the open and announce their aims. Powderly was a politician, a self-seeking, 
  self-conscious public character, sensitive to public opinion. So, in 1878, under 
  his leadership, the order complied with the demand, and the public was informed 
  that the K of L were eager to &#8220;enjoy the blessings of life&#8221; and 
  that their battle-cry was &#8220;Moral worth, not wealth, Is the true standard 
  of individual and national greatness&#8221;. Powderly spoke pretentiously of 
  &#8216;uplift&#8217; . . . &#8216;ideals&#8217; . . . &#8216;principles&#8217;. 
</p>
<p class=subtitle>3</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Powderly&#8217;s and his cronies&#8217; opposition to strikes 
  as a means of gaining for the working class a greater share of industrial profits, 
  numerous walkouts, big and small, occurred the country over, commencing in 1880, 
  when conditions began slowly to improve after the dire effects of the panic. 
  The K of L leaders, so-called, were forced to make concessions to strong elements 
  within the order which insisted upon action.</p>
<p>Most of the K of L strikes, however, as well as others of that period, were 
  unsuccessful because dishonestly or incompetently led. A typical K of L strike 
  in the early years of Powderly&#8217;s regime was that of the telegraphers, 
  in 1883. They had organized nationally and become affiliated with the K of L 
  the year before, The impulse for the movement came from below, strong enough 
  to overcome the objections of the timorous general officers, conscious of their 
  inadequacy. The walkout occurred on 19 June against all commercial telegraph 
  companies, of which lay Gould&#8217;s Western Union, employing some 4000 operators, 
  was the greatest. The workers demanded one day off in seven, an eight hour day 
  shift and seven hour night shift, and a rise in wages.</p>
<p>The strike was a national affair, a topic on the floor of the United States 
  senate. Jay Gould was just then in deep trouble with the public for his over-contemptuous 
  attitude toward it, and a large portion of the press gave its support to the 
  strikers, not with any real feeling for the justice of their cause, but rather 
  to cater to a public prejudice. The country was once more reminded of the existence 
  of the &#8216;labor&#8217; problem.</p>
<p>But the blacklist was already a well-developed method of the capitalists to 
  subdue the workers. In this instance, the Western Union and other companies 
  employed the mere threat of it successfully, Frightened, one by one, the strikers 
  returned to work on the old terms, and by the end of July the strike was a dead 
  failure. There had been no leadership, no discipline, no adequate strike fund.</p>
<p>In the early and middle 1880s there were numerous minor disturbances all over 
  the country, for the most part spontaneous outbursts of badly organized, practically 
  leaderless workers. Yet, in the midst of all the failures, there appeared occasional 
  signs that by and by organized workers might become effective.</p>
<p>Of the few successful strikes, the most notable were the K of L railroad strikes 
  in 1885, On 16 February of that year, Jay Gould&#8217;s Wabash road announced 
  a 10% cut in the wages of its shopmen, Other Gould companies had preceded the 
  Wabash with similar announcements. Within two weeks, close to 5000 shopmen struck 
  on three Gould lines. The engineers, brakemen, firemen and conductors declared 
  themselves in sympathy with the walkout and seemed ready to translate their 
  sympathy into action.</p>
<p>The wage cut did not go into effect; the workers won the strike.</p>
<p>The following summer, however, the Wabash discharged a large force of K of 
  L shopmen, which amounted practically to a lockout, in direct violation of the 
  agreement that had ended the strike in the spring. The K of L then ordered a 
  boycott of the Wabash rolling stock, which, had it been put into effect, would 
  have disorganized over 20,000 miles of railways, The boycott was by this time 
  an effective weapon in the hands of workers to which even the K of L uplifters 
  did not object very strenuously.<br>
  Jay Gould took alarm; the terrible riots of &#8216;1877 were still fresh in 
  his mind, Before matters had gone much further, he hastily invited the K of 
  L railway men&#8217;s leaders to a conference with the managers of his roads, 
  at which he lent his support to proposals to yield to the unions. The unions 
  recalled the boycott order, and in the final settlement the Wabash made several 
  concessions to them.</p>
<p>The concessions were slight, but the victory was nonetheless tremendous, in 
  view of the fact that in the dispute the workers&#8217; leaders were for the 
  first time accepted on equal terms by one of the outstanding plutocrats in the 
  country who had been, and inwardly no doubt continued to be, a leading union-hater. 
  To all seeming, the mighty Jay had been compelled to recognize organized workers 
  as a power equal, if not superior, to himself, Soon after the settlement a Chicago 
  divine and lecturer on social problems was saying: </p>
<blockquote>
  <p>It is not long since William H Vanderbilt dismissed a reference to the will 
    of people with a profane sneer which showed his utter contempt of the people&#8217;s 
    rights Now one whose power in the railroad world is only - to that of Vanderbilt 
    finds that today the demands of his laborers cannot be dismissed that way</blockquote>
<p>There was something intensely dramatic and spectacular in this first important 
  victory. Immediately after it, there began a veritable stampede of the loose 
  toiling masses to join the K of L unions. The membership of the order increased 
  so rapidly that the general officers, fearful lest the organization should become 
  so huge as to be utterly unmanageable, began to refuse charters to new locals. 
  Among the new members were tens of thousands of unskilled and foreign-born workers.<br>
  The press of the country, both radical and reactionary, helped blindly to exaggerate 
  the significance of the victory, little dreaming that within a year it would 
  lead to troubles almost as great as, and more significant than, those of 1877.</p>
<p class=subtitle>4</p>
<p>Meantime, radical ideas were spreading in America. The most widely read book 
  in the 1880s was Henry George&#8217;s Progress and Poverty. In three years it 
  went through more than a hundred editions and George&#8217;s analysis of the 
  economic and social conditions was discussed before workers&#8217; groups, in 
  colleges, from pulpits.<br>
  There was a reason. The industrial conditions were horrible. I quote a few statements 
  that appear in the official surveys of the National Bureau of Labor Statistics 
  in Washington for 1885 and 1886 which contain a hint of the working people&#8217;s 
  plight at that period. Said a clergyman of Fall River, Massachusetts: <br>
  Perhaps&#8230; the evils which exist arise from&#8230; the increasing tendency 
  to regard the operative simply as a wheel, or a pin to a machine. He is, in 
  the eyes of the employers, very much what a mule or a spindle is, and no more&#8230; 
  The employers care not who or what the operative is, or where he lives, or what 
  his character, except as any of these things bear on production&#8230; We are 
  preparing for new Liverpools and new Lancashires on American soil, with ignorance, 
  vice and stupidity as the characteristics of the working population. <br>
  A physician in the same city: <br>
  Every mill in town is making money. . . but the operatives travel in the same 
  old path &#8211; sickness, suffering, smell pay.<br>
  <br>
  The labor commissioner of New Jersey said officially: <br>
  The struggle for existence is daily becoming keener, and the average wage-laborer 
  must practice the strictest economy, or he will find himself behind at the end 
  of the season&#8230; The men&#8217;s remuneration because of female and child 
  labor competition has been reduced to such an extent that only with the aid 
  received from other members of the family are they able to keep the wolf from 
  the door&#8230; Children are occupying the places of adult labor here.<br>
  <br>
  And the labor commissioner of the state of New York: <br>
  Grinding poverty is a very general cause of prostitution. The prominent fact 
  is that a large number of operatives and domestics earn such small wages that 
  a temporary cessation of business, or being a short time out of situation, is 
  sufficient to reduce them to absolute distress, and it becomes a literal battle 
  for life.<br>
  <br>
  I could quote endlessly from the same source. On the other hand there were many 
  people who were inclined to agree with the New York World when it said: <br>
  <br>
  The American laborer must make up his mind, henceforth, not to be so much better 
  off than the European laborer. Men must be content to work for low wages. In 
  this way the workingman will be nearer to that station in life to which it has 
  pleased God to call him. </p>
<p class=subtitle>5</p>
  <p>The union movement - the K of L, the independent trade unions, and the railway 
  brotherhoods - looked formidable numerically. Actually, with such leaders as 
  Powderly, it was anything but effectual. Its ideas were crude, undeveloped. 
  It was, like every other movement in America at that time, chaotic, utterly 
  lacking in statesmanship. This lack is apparent throughout the history of the 
  K of L. When unemployment was general, for instance, the K of L leaders, in 
  an effort to decrease it, officially urged the workers to break beer and milk 
  bottles after emptying them and thus increase employment in the glass industry. 
  This, incidentally, was one of the first cases of sabotage propaganda in America. 
  </p><p>
  Thousands of workers, many of whom were members of the K of L or of regular 
  trade unions, gathered in secret meetings, at which extremists inflamed their 
  minds and emotions, and attended shooting practice in the woods, preparing themselves 
  for the big war on the open job market their necessity impelled them to struggle 
  ceaselessly against members of their own class, but at these underground meetings 
  the idea was impressed upon them that they could obtain redress for their wrongs 
  only as they compelled it by violence. Capitalists used force in keeping down 
  the proletariat; therefore the proletariat was obliged to resort to force.<br>
  Behind this extremist attitude were the abnormal, desperate impulses born of 
  starvation and abuse. </p><p class=subtitle>
  6</p><p>
  In the mid-1880s, as I have suggested, Chicago was the heart of extreme radical 
  propaganda in the United States - and with good reason. Nowhere in America was 
  the capitalists&#8217; contempt for the public interest stronger than in Chicago 
  - for folk who had failed to make big money in general, and for the working 
  class in particular. In no American city was class demarcation sharper, nor, 
  it may be added, did the press anywhere else more vehemently uphold to such 
  extremities the sacred rights of property. The Chicago rich were notorious for 
  their debauchery. After the great fire in 1871, which destroyed the city, the 
  more sanctimonious citizens of Boston and Philadelphia declared that the flames 
  had been sent as a judgement from on high upon a modern city of the plain. Preachers 
  likened it also to Babylon, Tyre and Pompeii. In the rebuilt, booming city the 
  manners of the rich were unchanged.</p><p>
  In the late 1870s and the early 1880s, the militant radicals of Chicago .WI 
  clung to political action as a possible means of improving the conditions of 
  the underdog. In municipal campaigns they managed, now and then, to send one 
  or two men to the city council, though of course their presence there was ineffectual. 
  Then, in the election of 1885, the Socialist Labor Party was badly defeated, 
  losing all representation in the city&#8217;s political life, with the result 
  that the extremists in the movement became even more rabid and violent. . Thenceforth 
  anarchism was definitely a growing movement in Chicago. The active membership 
  of the anarchist clubs perhaps never exceeded 3000, surely a small number in 
  a community of 850,000, but among the leaders were picturesque, intense men 
  - Parsons, August Spies and Michael Schwab of Die Arbeiter Zeitung; Samuel Fielden, 
  an ex-Methodist minister; Oscar Neebe, organizer of the Beer Wagon Drivers; 
  Adolph Fischer, a printer; George Engel, a toy maker; and, to mention but one 
  more, Louis Lingg, organizer of the Carpenters&#8217; Union. They talked much 
  of the revolution, dynamite, human rights, justice, firearms, liberty, arson, 
  and received much sensational publicity in the big conservative newspapers, 
  which referred to their agitation as &#8216;the menace&#8217;. To some of these 
  men dynamite was little more than a word, a vague symbol of people&#8217;s uprising; 
  to the others - Lingg, for one - it was the real stuff. </p><p>
  Reading The Tribune, The Times and The Daily News, the general public was, of 
  course, alarmed. The community developed a state of mind not unlike the Bolshevik 
  scare that gripped the United States after the first world war. Soon every radical, 
  no matter how mild his or her views actually were, was considered an anarchist, 
  just as 40 years later everyone who held notions not endorsed by the Ku Klux 
  Klan, the American Legion, and the Daughters of the American Revolution, was 
  branded a &#8216;bolshevik &#8216;.</p><p>
  With the industrial depression in 1884-1886, the situation was intensified. 
  Tens of thousands were unemployed. There were hopeless strikes, wage cuts, lockouts&#8230; 
  misery. And agitators were busy. &#8220;The workers&#8221;, writes Mother Jones, 
  &#8220;asked only for bread and a shortening of the long hours. The agitators 
  gave them visions. The police gave them clubs&#8221;. The feelings on both sides 
  ran high. The Tribune, according to Mother Jones, &#8220;suggested&#8230; that 
  the farmers of Illinois treat the tramps - unemployed workers that poured out 
  of the great industrial cities - as they did other pests, by putting strychnine 
  in their food&#8221;. </p><p class=subtitle>
  7 </p><p>
  After the K of L victory over the formidable Jay Gould, there was, as I have 
  said, a veritable rush on the part of unorganized workers to join the unions 
  affiliated with the order. The conservative press, as I have also mentioned, 
  helped to bring this stampede about by exaggerating the significance of Gould&#8217;s 
  defeat.</p><p>
  On the streets of Chicago, in saloons, and wherever else workers gathered, one 
  could hear, early in 1886, such songs as: </p><blockquote>
  Toiling millions now are waking--<br>
  See them marching on;<br>
  All the tyrants now are shaking,<br>
  Ere their power&#8217;s gone.<br>
  Chorus: <br>
  Storm the fort, ye Knights of Labor,<br>
  Battle for your cause;<br>
  Equal rights for every neighbor--<br>
  Down with tyrant laws! </blockquote>
  <p>The situation had slipped entirely out of the hands of Powderly and other big 
  officials.</p><p>
  Some trade unions not affiliated with the K of L had decided, in 1884, to start 
  an intensive campaign for the eight hour working day. Subsequently, 1 May, 1886 
  was fixed as the day on which it should be put into effect. As the day - der 
  Tag - approached, the movement gained in volume and determination, especially 
  after the railway men&#8217;s momentous tiff with Jay Gould. This was true not 
  only in Chicago, but all over the country. Eight hour leagues were formed in 
  the cities and huge rallies conducted through the fall and winter of 1885 and 
  the early spring of 1886.</p><p>
  In Chicago the agitation was most intense. Late in 1885, George A Schilling, 
  a socialist, organized the Eight Hour Association, to which the principle bodies 
  of the city, including K of L unions, gave immediate support</p><p>
  The anarchists at first viewed the eight hour movement with scorn, insisting 
  that it was useless to demand anything from the capitalists; the thing to do 
  was to arm the working class and &#8220;take over the whole damn system and 
  change it&#8221;. But as the movement became the all-absorbing topic of the 
  proletariat, they - Parsons, Spies, Schwab, Fielden, and other ultra-radical 
  orators and publicists - joined and, with their talents, soon became the outstanding, 
  if not the most popular, agitators of the cause.</p><p>
  The conservative press, of course, now immediately branded the whole eight hour 
  agitation as &#8216;foreign&#8217;, &#8216;un-American&#8217;, &#8216;anarchistic&#8217;. 
  Individuals who participated in it, whether they were trade unionists, K of 
  L, or whatnot, were not only dirty, low-down foreign scum, but enemies of the 
  United States and everything that was decent and holy. &#8220;The city was divided 
  into two camps&#8221;, quoting again from Mother Jones&#8217; Autobiography. 
  &#8220;The working people on one side - hungry, cold, jobless, fighting gunmen 
  and police clubs with bare hands. On the other side the employers, supported 
  by the newspapers, by the police, by all the powers of the great state itself.&#8221;</p><p>
  The employers and the authorities were being warned by liberal, discerning speakers 
  and publicists that the existing state of affairs was leading to upheavals worse 
  than those of 1877. A few months before the Haymarket explosion a prominent 
  Illinois clergyman was saying in Chicago:</p><blockquote>
  And, my friends&#8230; the laboring classes constitute the bulk of our population, 
  and it will be an unhappy day for this country when any great numbers of them 
  become &#8216;fire and blood&#8217; socialists [i.e. anarchists]. But many things 
  in these days are driving them and drawing them that way&#8230; The country 
  at large would be horrified to see, in plain English, the utterances which are 
  daily circulated by socialist journals among the laborers in our great cities&#8230; 
  And there are other tokens then the noisy threats and appeals of the Socialists. 
  The laboring men have awakened to the power of organization. They have begun 
  to assert themselves where recently they only complained, or were silent&#8230; 
  a power which suddenly dares to measure swords with a railway millionaire like 
  Jay Gould has sprung up. It is growing. It declares its purpose to continue 
  to grow. </blockquote>
  <p class=subtitle>The Haymarket Bomb</p><p>
  The eight hour agitation continued all winter throughout the country.</p><p>
  In Chicago, the anarchists ran the whole show. They held meetings on the lakefront, 
  their crowds consisting mostly of jobless, hungry men, many of whom had no place 
  to sleep. The red flag was displayed at these rallies, the speakers explaining 
  that it was a &#8216;symbol of the people&#8217;s revolutionary spirit&#8217;. 
  Then the black flag appeared, &#8216;symbolical of poverty and hunger of desperation&#8217;. 
  Parsons and Fielden were the most popular speakers. They denounced the Chicago 
  board of trade (&#8216;the board of thieves&#8217;) which had recently dedicated 
  its new $2,000,000 building (&#8216;the temple of usury&#8217;) while 2,500,000 
  men were jobless in the United States.</p><p>
  &#8220;How long will you be content with 15 cent meals&#8221;, asked Fielden, 
  &#8220;when those fellows are sitting down to banquets at 20 dollars a plate?&#8221;</p><p>
  More than 1000 members of the so-called Lehr-und-Wehr Vereine drilled with rifles 
  in secret halls and practiced shooting in the woods.</p><p>
  At the same time the employers were meeting in George M Pullman&#8217;s residence, 
  or in the office of Wirt Dexter, Chicago&#8217;s foremost corporation attorney, 
  to discuss the sinister eight hour movement, &#8216;the damned anarchists&#8217; 
  and what they could do about it all.</p><p>
  The public at large was torn between a vague, distant sympathy for the hard-pressed 
  proletariat and the fear that within the mobs of those sullen-eyed, rough-looking 
  people, jobless and homeless, most of them foreign-born, there lurked something 
  awful and gigantic; and the people shuddered in their homes, their offices, 
  their pews.</p><p>
  Carter H Harrison was mayor of Chicago, serving his fourth consecutive term 
  in office. He was rich and fat, wore silk underwear, hobnobbed with the town&#8217;s 
  wealthiest figures, but at the same time consistently stood up, in all sincerity 
  and in the face of great opposition, for the rights of the underdog. He loved 
  the plain people and enjoyed their affection. He was in sympathy with unions 
  and insisted on having a wide-open town because it was good for business. He 
  believed in freedom and, as a gesture in that direction, appointed radicals 
  to minor offices. He loved Chicago; the city was his &#8216;bride&#8217;, who, 
  he said, &#8220;laves her beautiful limbs daily in Lake Michigan and comes out 
  clean and pure every morning&#8221;.</p><p>
  The mayor tried his best to lessen the tension that had gripped the city during 
  the eight hour movement. He declared that he would not allow troops to be brought 
  in to slaughter workers, insisting that they, too, were citizens of Chicago. 
  But he was practically the only sane man of any influence in town; everybody 
  else had gone mad. The business leaders in the city were too panicky to listen 
  to reason; they believed the agitation had already proceeded too far. It must 
  be stopped. The Tribune printed Articles and letters from its subscribers urging 
  the authorities to break up the workers&#8217; meetings with gunfire - and, 
  if necessary, with dynamite!</p><p>
  Everything seemed to conspire to bring the crisis to a head. The winter was 
  a severe one, causing fearful suffering among the poor. The mayor and charitable 
  institutions opened soup kitchens, but this was a mere drop in the bucket. Gaunt, 
  ragged men and women paraded the streets carrying red and black flags, and the 
  police often dispersed them, kicking and clubbing them, contrary to Mayor Harrison&#8217;s 
  orders. The police, obviously, received their orders from other sources.</p><p>
  On Christmas Day, the anarchists organized a march, on fashionable Prairie Avenue, 
  of several hundred starved and wretched-looking men and women. One old woman 
  carried a red flag, another a black flag. They stopped before the residences 
  of the wealthy, uttering groans and cat-calls, ringing doorbells. The parade, 
  says Mother Jones, &#8220;had no educational value. It only served to increase 
  the employers&#8217; fear and make the police more savage, and the public less 
  sympathetic to the real distress of the workers&#8221;. The anarchist papers 
  printed violent editorials. Die Arbeiter Zeitung said on 21 April 1886: </p><blockquote>
  He who submits to the present order of things has no right to complain about 
  capitalist extortion, for order means sustaining that; and he who revolts&#8230; 
  is a rebel, and has no right to complain if he is met by soldiers. Every class 
  defends itself as well as it can. A rebel who really puts himself opposite the 
  mouth of the cannons of his enemies, with empty fists, is a fool.</blockquote><p>
  The same paper, a week later:</p>
  
 <blockquote>The police and soldiers&#8230; must be met by armed armies of workers&#8230; 
  Arms are more necessary in our time than anything else. Whoever has no money, 
  should sell his watch, if he has one, and buy firearms. Stones and sticks will 
  not avail against the hired assassins and extortionists. It is time to arm yourselves!</blockquote>
  <p class=subtitle>2</p><p>
  Winter passed and the big day - der Tag, the first of May - drew near. </p><p>
  The employers were determined that they would yield no more concessions. The 
  eight hour idea must be fought. Jay Gould had been a damn fool to recognize 
  the unions! They would crush the unions and, run their factories on the open 
  shop basis. </p><p>
  Accordingly, in February the McCormick Reaper Works locked out hundreds of union 
  members and hired scabs and 300 Pinkerton detectives - gunmen - to protect the 
  scabs. This was one of the most important immediate factors in rousing proletarian 
  bitterness, and the agitators, naturally enough, stressed the situation for 
  all it was worth.</p><p>
  One of the organizations involved in the McCormick lockout was the International 
  Carpenters&#8217; Union, of which Louis Lingg, an outspoken anarchist, was the 
  most energetic leader. He believed in dynamite, the real stuff, and advocated 
  its use. Shortly after the lockout he addressed a circular to his followers: 
  </p><blockquote>
  I say we must resist these monsters [i.e., the capitalists and their hired gunmen]. 
  We must fight them with as good weapons, even better than they possess, and 
  therefore, I call you to arms!&#8230; The first of May is coming near. You must 
  kill the pirates. You must kill the bloodsuckers&#8230; Our work is short; we 
  do not want a thirty years war. Be determined!</blockquote><p>
  Parsons, Fielden and Schwab held meetings near the McCormick Reaper Works. Minor 
  riots occurred every few days.</p><p>
  The situation was extremely tense. On one side, hunger and desperation; on the 
  other, greed and fear.</p><p>
  On 1 May Die Arbeiter Zeitung shouted: </p><blockquote>
  Bravely forward! The conflict has begun&#8230; Workers, let your watchword be: 
  No Compromise! Cowards to the read! Men to the front! The die is cast! The first 
  of May is here&#8230; Clean your guns, complete your ammunition. The hired murderers 
  of the capitalists, the police and militia, are ready to murder, No worker should 
  leave his house in these days with empty pockets.</blockquote>
  <p>
  The thronged streets were full of whispers.</p><p>
  Almost at the last moment the executive body of the Knights of Labor in Chicago 
  had withdrawn its endorsement of the general strike on 1 May for the eight hour 
  day. Such men as Powderly had become frightened by their own power; besides, 
  everybody was saying that the movement was &#8216;anarchistic&#8217; and &#8216;foreign&#8217;, 
  and they certainly were no anarchists, nor foreigners.</p><p>
  The public was in suspense. Some of the men in the streets looked desperate. 
  There was some talk that the anarchists intended to bomb the police stations 
  and exterminate the whole force.</p><p>
  But nothing terrible or decisive happened on the first or the second of May. 
  </p><p>
  On 3 May Die Arbeiter Zeitung said: &#8220;A hot conflict!&#8230; Courage! courage! 
  is our cry.&#8221;</p><p>
  On that day the locked-out McCormick employees held a mass meeting near the 
  works. They were desperate. August Spies was speaking to the mob about the eight 
  hour movement when the factory whistle blew and out came the scabs, done with 
  the day&#8217;s work.</p><p>
  A pitched battle followed with stones, bricks, fists and sticks. A few shots 
  were fired. Then the police arrived on the scene and, opening fire on the crowd, 
  killed several people in a few minutes and wounded many more. Spies, enraged, 
  rushed to the office of Die Arbeiter Zeitung and printed his famous &#8216;Revenge!&#8217; 
  circular. A few hours after the shooting the streets wore flooded with the leaflets. 
  &#8216;Revenge!&#8217; </p><p class=subtitle>
  3 </p><p>
  Next morning Die Arbeiter Zeitung screamed on the front page:</p><blockquote>
  BLOOD! Lead and powder as a cure for dissatisfied workers &#8211; This is law 
  and order! &#8230; In palaces they fill their goblets with costly wines and 
  pledge the health of the bloody banditti of law and order. Dry you tears, you 
  poor and suffering. Take heart! Rise in your might and level the existing robber 
  rule in the dust!</p><p>
  On the streets appeared more leaflets calling the workers to a protest mass 
  meeting in Haymarket Square that evening. &#8220;Workingmen, Arm Yourselves 
  and Appear in Full Force!&#8221;</p></blockquote><p>
  In the evening some 3000 men, women and children gathered in the square.</p><p>
  Mayor Harrison, much disturbed, was there. His bride, it seemed, was having 
  a fit. He waddled nervously between the square and the nearby police station, 
  where a small army of officers waited in readiness. He mingled with the ragged, 
  sullen-eyed proletarians, striking match after match without lighting his fat 
  cigar. He explained to a friend: &#8220;I want the people to know that their 
  mayor is here&#8221;. Some of the men wore dark looks, but to the mayor the 
  meeting seemed tame. The speeches were not violent. Parsons discussed economics.</p><p>
  Drops of rain fell. Overhead were dark, threatening clouds; a sharp wind blew 
  from the lake. People were beginning to go home, lest they be caught in the 
  storm.</p><p>
  At 10pm Mayor Harrison, chewing his unlit cigar, waddled back to the station 
  house and there remarked to the inspector in charge: &#8220;Nothing is likely 
  to occur to require interference&#8221;, and went home.</p><p>
  But less than 15 minutes later, the inspector ordered one of his subordinates 
  to turn out the entire force - 176 officers - and march to the square and order 
  the meeting to disband. Palpably, the inspector had orders from someone more 
  powerful in the police department than the mayor; from someone, no doubt, who 
  wanted a riot.</p><p>
  It rained. The crowd had dwindled down to about 500 people, mostly men, The 
  meeting was anything but a success.</p><p>
  Fielden, the last man to speak, was saying: &#8220;I shall be through in a few 
  minutes and then we&#8217;ll all go home.&#8221;</p><p>
  His beard dripping, he spoke briefly. &#8220;In conclusion -&#8221;</p><p>
  Then he saw the army of policemen marching to the square.</p><p>
  Coming within a few feet of the crowd, the captain in command called &#8220;Halt!&#8221; 
  - and, with drawn sword, advanced towards the speaker.</p><p>
  &#8220;I command you&#8221;, he said at the top of his voice, &#8220;in the 
  name of the people to immediately and peaceably disperse!&#8221;</p><p>
  A moment of intense silence; only the sharp wind from the lake swished through 
  the crowd and the police ranks, driving the rain in their faces. </p><p>
  &#8220;Why, captain&#8221;, said Fielden at last, &#8220;we are peaceable&#8221;. 
  (It is certain that he did not say: &#8220;Here are the bloodhounds! Men, do 
  your duty and I&#8217;ll do mine&#8221;, as he was quoted, later, by the police.)</p><p>
  Another spell of silence. Few in the crowd knew what was going on.</p><p>
  Then - suddenly - a blinding flash, a cloud of grey smoke - a terrific detonation, 
  a sickening smell. . . . Someone - possibly an anarchist, probably a hired racketeer 
  - had hurled a bomb from the alley a few feet from the speakers&#8217; stand, 
  just off the right flank of the police detachment.</p><p>
  Confusion. Firing started. Policemen were shooting at the crowd and at one another. 
  They could not see for the smoke. The workers returned fire and the square was 
  immediately strewn with bodies.</p><p>
  Then the police reformed and made a charge on the workers. The latter yelled 
  and groaned, trying to escape the volley of the enraged officers. Some were 
  dragging their dead and wounded friends and relatives with them.</p><p>
  All this happened in two or three minutes.</p><p>
  On the side of law and order, 67 policemen were wounded. Seven of them died. 
  The workers&#8217; casualties were perhaps twice, possibly three times, that 
  many; the number has never been determined. Several seriously wounded workers 
  were taken to the station house along with the dead and injured policemen, but 
  the majority of them were cared for and carried off by relatives and friends.</p><p>
</p><p class=subtitle>
  4 </p><p>
  The following day it was evident that Chicago had neglected to &#8220;lave her 
  beautiful limbs in lake Michigan&#8221;. She was stunned, horrified, crazed. 
  The pages of The Tribune, The Times, The Doily News shrieked and howled. For 
  the first time dynamite had been used in the United States for the destruction 
  of human life.</p><p>
  The papers reported that the city was being &#8216;combed&#8217; for anarchists, 
  which included practically everybody who had any active sympathy for workers. 
  Several hundred arrests were made. The police raided radical newspaper offices 
  and hang-outs. The authorities, it seemed, were determined to make an example 
  of the leaders of &#8216;black terror&#8217;. The editorial writers said that 
  the city was &#8220;determined to stamp out, once and forever, socialism, anarchism, 
  communism - different labels for the same vile monstrosity&#8221;.</p><p>
  People stood on street corners, in the middle of sidewalks, along the bars in 
  saloons, excited and feverish, talking about the awful event of the night before. 
  The anarchists did it - of course! No one paused to think, to question.</p><p>
  &#8220;Hang &#8216;em and try &#8216;em afterward&#8221;, was the prevailing 
  sentiment, not only of the well-to-do and the respectable, but of workers as 
  well. Preachers pounded the pulpits. Each class vied with the other in demanding 
  drastic measures to suppress &#8216;the black international&#8217;. The Chicago 
  K of L issued an official statement:</p><blockquote><p>
  Let it be understood by all the world that the Knights of Labor have no affiliation, 
  association, sympathy, or respect for the band of cowardly murderers, cutthroats, 
  assassins, stirring up the passions of ignorant foreigners, unfurling the red 
  flag of anarchy, and causing riot and bloodshed&#8230; We hope the whole gang 
  of outlaws will be blotted from the face of the earth.</blockquote><p>
  The police &#8216;discovered&#8217; bombs; not only single bombs, but secret 
  dynamite factories, whole arsenals of infernal machines. Newspapers the country 
  over printed wild, exaggerated tales of terrible dynamite conspiracies. Editorially, 
  the press of the country called for the blood of the anarchist agitators.</p><p>
  A grand jury composed of prosperous businessmen indicted Fielden, Parsons, Spies, 
  Schwab, Fischer, Engel, Lingg, Neebe, William Seliger (Lingg&#8217;s landlord) 
  and Rudolph Schnaubelt. Schnaubelt escaped to Europe; the case against Seliger 
  was dismissed.</p><p>
  No criminal lawyer in the city would take their cases. The venomous press suggested 
  that the attorney who would defend the anarchists was no better than an anarchist 
  himself and ought to be hanged with them. Finally, three men engaged in civil 
  practice dared to go against the hostile public sentiment of the entire country. 
  One was William P Black, popularly known in Chicago as Captain Black, a pugnacious 
  fellow, impressive looking, with a mop of grey hair; a serious student of public 
  matters, sympathetic to the working class cause. Another was William A Foster, 
  also an able man. The third was a young man by the name of Sigmund Zeisler, 
  a foreigner recently admitted to the bar.</p><p>
  A defence committee was formed, but contributions to the fund came in slowly, 
  in sums from one to five dollars.</p><p>
  Judge Joseph E Gary, at one time a carpenter, now a reactionary politician, 
  presided at the trial which began on 21 June. The State&#8217;s attorney was 
  the intellectual-looking Julius S Grinnel, who also had high political aspirations.</p><p>
  The public demanded that the accused be tried, if tried they must be, and strung 
  up as swiftly as possible. Newspapers teemed with stories of wholesale dynamite 
  plots. An unprejudiced jury was impossible. At least four of the 12 men finally 
  selected admitted in the examination that they hated all anarchists, socialists 
  and communists.</p><p>
  The charge was murder. Not that any of the eight men were accused of having 
  thrown the bomb, but merely that their inflammatory speeches and editorials 
  had prompted the bomb thrower - whoever that was - to the crime. The public 
  was satisfied that none of the defendants, with the possible exception of Louis 
  Lingg, had personally hurled a bomb, but no one questioned that it was thrown 
  by someone inspired by these men. The prosecution exhibited a collection of 
  apparatus which, it insisted, Lingg had used in manufacturing bombs.</p><p>
  On 19 August the jury found the men guilty and Judge Gary sentenced Parsons, 
  Spies, Lingg, Fielden, Schwab, Fischer and Engel to death. Neebe, who merely 
  owned a financial interest in Die Arbeiter Zeitung, was given 15 years in prison.</p><p>
  When the mob outside the courthouse learned of the verdict it broke into cheers. 
</p>
<p class=subtitle>5</p><p>
  The condemned men and Neebe were allowed to address the court. Their speeches 
  have since been printed and reprinted in pamphlets all over the world.</p><p>
  Fielden spoke for three hours through his heavy beard. He said: </p>
<blockquote>  Today, the beautiful autumn kisses with balmy breeze the cheek of every free 
  man, I stand here never to bathe my face in its rays ever again. I have loved 
  my fellow man as I have loved myself. I have hated trickery, dishonesty, and 
  injustice. If it will do any good, I freely give myself up. </blockquote><p>
  And Spies: </p><blockquote>
  If you think that by hanging us you can stamp out the labor movement, then call 
  your hangman&#8230; You cannot understand it. </blockquote><p>
  And Neebe:</p>
  <blockquote>
  Well, those are the crimes I have committed: I organized trade unions. I was 
  for reduction of the hours of labor, and the education of the laboring man, 
  and the re-establishment of &#8216;Die Arbeiter Zeitung&#8217;, the workingmen&#8217;s 
  paper. There is no evidence to show that I was connected with the bomb throwing, 
  or that I was near it, or anything of that kind. </blockquote><p>
  And Fischer: </p><blockquote>
  The more the believers in just causes are persecuted, the quicker will their 
  ideas be realized.</blockquote>
  <p>And Parsons: </p>
  <blockquote>I am one of those, although myself a wage slave, who hold that it is wrong to 
  myself, wrong to my neighbor... for me&#8230; to make my escape from wage slavery 
  by becoming a master and an owner of slaves myself&#8230; This is my only crime, 
  before high heaven.</blockquote><p>
  And Engel:</p><blockquote>
  I am too much a man of feeling not to battle against the conditions of today. 
  Every thoughtful person must combat a system which makes it possible for the 
  individual to rake and hoard millions in a few years, while on the other side, 
  thousands become tramps and beggars.</blockquote><p>
  Schwab chose to define anarchy as:</p><blockquote>
  A state of society in which the only government is reason; the state of society 
  in which all human beings do right for the simple reason that it is right and 
  hate wrong because it is wrong.</blockquote><p>
  And finally, Lingg &#8211; contemptuous, defiant, as he had been throughout 
  the trial:</p><blockquote>
  I repeat that I am enemy of the &#8220;order&#8221; of today, and I repeat that, 
  with all my powers, so long as breath remains in me, I shall combat it. I declare 
  frankly and openly that I am in favor of using force. I have told Captain Schaack 
  [who had arrested him] and I stand by it; &#8220;if you fire upon us, we shall 
  dynamite you!&#8221; Ah, you laugh! Perhaps you think, &#8220;You&#8217;ll throw 
  no more bombs&#8221;; but let me assure you that I die happy on the gallows, 
  so confident I am that the hundreds and thousands to whom I have spoken will 
  remember my words; and when you shall have hanged us, then, mark my words, they 
  will do the bomb throwing! In this hope I say to you; I despise you! I despise 
  your &#8220;order&#8221;, your laws, your force-propped authority. Hang me for 
  it!</blockquote>
  <p>Frantic attempts were made by the defence, by radical organizations and individuals 
  to save the men. Europe became interested in the case. George Bernard Shaw went 
  about London with a petition for the reprieve of the anarchists, getting signatures 
  of English literary men. Among those who signed it was Oscar Wilde. William 
  Morris wrote to Robert Browning, four days before the executions:</p><blockquote>
  I venture to write and ask you to sign the enclosed appeal for mercy and so 
  to do what you can to save the lives of seven men who have been condemned to 
  death for a deed of which they were not guilty, after a mere mockery of a trial&#8230; 
  I do not know if you have taken note of the events&#8230; nor can I give you 
  a full account of my view of the matter. But I will ask you to believe me as 
  an honest man when I say that these men have been made to pay [because of their 
  opinions] for the whole body of the workers in Chicago who were engaged in a 
  contest with the capitalists last year. You know how much more violent and brutal 
  such contests are in America than in England, and of how little account human 
  life is held there if it happens to thwart the progress of the dollar; and I 
  hope that you will agree that the victors in the struggle need not put to death 
  the prisoners of war they took, after having kept them more than a year in prison. 
  </blockquote><p>
  William Dean Howells took the side of the prisoners. On the other hand, such 
  American radicals or liberals as Robert Ingersoll and Henry George refused to 
  appeal to Governor Oglesby for mercy. Ingersoll explained that, in the civil 
  war, Oglesby had saved his life and he did not wish to embarrass him!</p><p>
  On 10 November 1887, Governor Oglesby commuted the sentences of&#8217; Fielden 
  and Schwab to life imprisonment. On the same day, Lingg blew off his head by 
  exploding a tiny percussion cap in his mouth. His sweetheart had smuggled it 
  into his cell. Parsons declined to apply for a commutation of his sentence to 
  life term, quoting Patrick Henry: &#8220;Give me liberty or give me death.&#8221;</p><p>
  Next morning, before being hanged, Fischer, Engel, Spies and Parsons spoke from 
  the gallows:</p><blockquote><p>
  FISCHER: This the happiest moment in my life. <br><br>
  ENGEL: Hurrah for anarchy!<br><br>
  SPIES: There will come a time when our silence will be more.. powerful than 
  the, voices you strangle today.<br><br>
  PARSONS: Let me speak, O men of America! Will you let me speak, Sheriff Matson? 
  Let the voice of the people be heard. Oh----</p></blockquote>
