  March 1919. History Committee: May Young (waitress), John Mckelvey (Shipbuilder),

<p class="subtitle">ROOT&amp;BRANCH PREFACE</p>
<p>From February 6 to February 11, 1919, nearly 100,000 Seattle workers participated 
  in a general strike. This pamphlet is a history of the strike, written by the 
  History Committee of the General Strike Committee shortly after the end of the 
  strike. It was compiled by Anna Louise Strong, then a &#8220;progressive&#8221; 
  reporter for the union-owned Seattle daily, The Union Record. Before being published 
  in final form, everything was submitted first to the history committee and then 
  published in The Union Record, where workers comments were invited.</p>
<p>We are reprinting it for several reasons. First, it provides a concrete account 
  of one of the few general strikes in this country&#8217;s history. Although 
  conditions have changed considerably, it still gives a good idea of what happens 
  during a general strike and what problems arise. Second, the Seattle general 
  strike was the general strike in the USA that went farthest towards workers&#8217; 
  management, both in concept and in practice. It was seen, by both participants 
  and opponents, as part of a process through which workers were preparing themselves 
  to run industry and society, Final authority in running the strike rested with 
  a General Strike Committee, three members from each striking local, elected 
  by the rank-and-file. The 300 members of the committee were mostly rank-and-filers 
  with little previous leadership experience. During the strike, this committee 
  or its Executive Committee of 15 virtually ran Seattle. The strike was not a 
  simple shutdown of the city. Instead, workers in different trades organized 
  themselves to provide essential services, such as doing hospital laundry, getting 
  milk to babies, collecting wet garbage, and many other things.</p>
<p>Third, the idea of strikers providing partial services presented here can be 
  useful not only in general but in more limited strikes. Such tactics can help 
  to keep non-striking workers (i.e. workers outside the striking plant, industry, 
  or service) on the side of the strikers and at the same time hit the capitalists 
  more directly. For example, in the 1970 postal strike, letter carriers promised 
  to deliver welfare checks even while on strike. In Cleveland, in 1944, streetcar 
  workers threatened to refuse to collect fares in order to win a pay increase 
  the City Council gave in before they actually used the tactic. Another possible 
  example would be if garbage workers picked up garbage every but the wealthy 
  and business sections. This type of action would in most cases have to be taken 
  outside the union, since few union bureaucracies would use such a clearly class-directed 
  tactic, and thus of necessity the workers would have to organize this themselves.</p>
<p class="subtitle">HISTORICAL BACKGROUND OF THE STRIKE</p>
<p>The Seattle strike took place in a time of upheaval and crisis throughout the 
  world. There had been a revolution in Russia, followed by revolts in Germany, 
  Hungary, and several other European countries, it was widely believed that workers 
  in these countries were overthrowing capitalism and taking over management of 
  production for themselves. The Russian Revolution was supported by large numbers 
  of workers in the U.S. as elsewhere. Late in 1919, longshoremen in both Seattle 
  and San Francisco refused to load arms and munitions destined for Admiral Kolchak, 
  leader of the counterrevolution in Siberia, and in Seattle they beat up the 
  scabs who tried to load them onto the government-chartered ship. To many workers, 
  the Russian revolution, as they conceived it (not realizing to what extent the 
  Bolsheviks had already destroyed the power of the workers&#8217; own factory 
  committees and soviets and instituted authoritarian rule), was something to 
  be followed here. [Root &amp; Branch note: As the leaflet &#8220;Russia Did 
  It&#8221;, circulated during the Seattle General Strike (referred to in the 
  text but never quoted), put it: &#8220;The Russians have shown you the way out. 
  What are you going to do about it? You are doomed to wage slavery till you die 
  unless you wake up, realize that you and the boss have nothing in common, that 
  the employing class must be overthrown, and that you, the workers, must take 
  over the control of your jobs, and through them, the control over your lives 
  instead of offering yourself up to the masters as a sacrifice six days a week, 
  so that they may coin profits out of your sweat and toil.&#8221;]</p>
<p>In this country also there was widespread labor turmoil. Vastly expanded production 
  for World War I and the cut-off of immigration made labor scarce, and placed 
  workers in a powerful position. To ensure steady production, under the changed 
  conditions, business and government made a deal with the conservative American 
  Federation of Labor. Government and management would give up union-breaking 
  and allow the A.F.L. to organize; in return, the unions would prevent strikes. 
  (This wartime experience of government- guaranteed unionization later became 
  the model for containing workers&#8217; movements in the 1930&#8217;s.) However, 
  despite the appeals to patriotism, the promises of a &#8220;new era&#8221; after 
  the war,-and the opposition of government, business, and the A.F.L., strikes 
  mushroomed during the war: the war years 1916-1918 averaged 2.4 times as many 
  workers on strike as 1915.</p>
<p>Two factors were largely responsible for this. First, there was an enormous 
  inflation associated with the war: the cost of living practically doubled from 
  August 1915 to the end of 1919. Thus while real wages increased, they lagged 
  far behind workers&#8217; expectations; meanwhile, the work week was greatly 
  lengthened. Second, as one wartime labor mediator wrote, &#8220;the urgent need 
  for production ... gave the workers a realization of strength which before they 
  had neither realized nor possessed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Big strikes practically stopped spruce lumber production and closed down the 
  most important copper areas early in the war. In Bridgeport, Conn., the most 
  important munitions center in the U.S., workers repeatedly stopped production 
  in defiance of the orders of both the National War Labor Board and their own 
  national union leaders.<br>
  Increasing militancy was accompanied by a growing spirit of solidarity. For 
  example, shipyard workers on the Pacific Coast tied up the yards for several 
  months in sympathy with the lumber strikers in the Northwest, refusing to handle 
  &#8220;ten-hour lumber&#8221; in order to aid the lumberers struggle for the 
  eight hour day. General strikes developed in Springfield, Ill., Kansas City, 
  Mo., Waco, Texas, and Billings, Montana, all to support particular groups of 
  striking workers.</p>
<p>When the war ended, the conflict increased. Now that the great war-time industrial 
  expansion was over, capitalists widely felt it necessary to reduce wages relative 
  to prices if profits were to be maintained. Thus the government simultaneously 
  ended war-time price controls and allowed corporations to resume their traditional 
  union-breaking policies. Between June 1919 and June 1920 the cost of living 
  index (taking 1913 as 100) rose from 177 to 216. Unemployment increased considerably 
  right after the end of the war. At the same time, workers were eager to receive 
  the benefits that war propaganda had promised them. The &#8220;new era&#8221; 
  they had been promised turned out to mean declining real incomes, growing unemployment, 
  and the undermining of what little defense against arbitrary management authority 
  they had won.</p>
<p>As a consequence, more workers participated in strikes in 1919 than in any 
  other year in American history except 1946. There were large strikes in the 
  New England and New Jersey textile districts, involving 120,000 workers, largely 
  opposed by the unions.</p>
<p>Three hundred fifty thousand steel workers walked out, crippling most of the 
  industry. They were met with a reign of terror in the large steel districts 
  in Western Pennsylvania, &#8220;red raids&#8221; and deportations from the federal 
  government, and lukewarm support (and at times treachery) from the trade union 
  movement. Since the A.F.L. unions had traditionally been all white, the employers 
  had no trouble recruiting 30 to 40 thousand black workers as strikebreakers. 
  The strikers held out for more than two months, but finally succumbed to the 
  overwhelming power of the steel industry and the government.</p>
<p>There were several other large strikes, many of them &#8220;outlaw&#8221; or 
  wildcat, heartily and openly opposed by the unions. The most important of these 
  was the strike of the railroad workers, which spread across the country. It 
  was eventually ended by the combined pressure of repression and some concessions. 
  Most protracted was the mass upheaval in the coalfields, with sporadic strikes, 
  national strikes, and armed battles running from 1919 into 1922. In the course 
  of these struggles, the idea of workers&#8217; management of production often 
  came to the fore. For example, in the course of a wildcat strike of Illinois 
  miners, a mass-meeting of 2,000 from the Nigger Hollow Mines adopted a resolution 
  which read:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;In view of the fact that the present-day system of Society, known 
    as the capitalist system, has completely broken down, and is no longer able 
    to supply the material and spiritual-needs of the workers of the land, and 
    in further view of the fact that the apologists for and the beneficiaries 
    of that system now try to placate the suffering masses by promises of reforms 
    such as a shorter workday and increases in wages, and in further view of the 
    futility of such reforms in the face of the world crisis that is facing the 
    capitalist system; therefore be it ... Resolved, that the next National Convention 
    of the U.M.W.A. issue a call to the workers of all industries to elect delegates 
    to an industrial congress, there to demand of the capitalist class that all 
    instruments of industries be turned over to the working-class to guarantee 
    that necessities, comforts, and luxuries be produced for the use of humanity 
    instead of a parasitical class of stockholders and bondholders, and that the 
    congress be called upon to pass an amendment to the Constitution of the United 
    States legalizing all such action in the aforementioned Congress.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Similar forces were at work in Seattle. Radical sentiment had simmered there 
  even during the war. When a socialist and former president of the Seattle A.F.L., 
  Hulet Wells, was convicted for opposing the draft and then tortured in prison, 
  the Seattle labor movement erupted with giant street rallies. Seattle union 
  membership had increased from 15,000 in 1915 to 60,000 by the end of 1918. Most 
  of the unions were affiliated with the A.F.L. but their ideas and action differed 
  greatly from A.F.L. policy; as Harry Ault, editor of The Union Record, and a 
  moderate in the local labor movement, put it: &#8220;I believe that 95 per cent 
  of us agree that the workers should control the industries. Nearly all of us 
  agree on that but very strenuously disagree on the method. Some of us think 
  we can get control through the Cooperative movement, some of us think through 
  Political action, and others think through industrial action.&quot;</p>
<p>Right after the end of the war, the I.W.W. (Industrial Workers of the World) 
  and the A.F.L. Metal Trades Council cooperated in sponsoring a Soldiers&#8217;, 
  Sailors&#8217;, and Workingmen&#8217;s Council, taking the Soviets of the Russian 
  revolution as their model.</p>
<p>If the Seattle General Strike was an aspect of the stormy conflicts throughout 
  the U.S. and the world in 1919, it also grew out of the specific historical 
  conditions in Seattle. Partially because of its geographic isolation, the Seattle 
  labor movement had developed a unique structure. Whereas most unions emphasize 
  the relation of workers to others in their own industry or trade, the most important 
  identification of Seattle workers was with the workers of Seattle as a whole. 
  (In Seattle, an attack on one group of workers was felt as an attack on all.) 
  This was reflected in and partially caused by the fact that most collective 
  bargaining was coordinated through the Central Labor Council, in which all A.F.L. 
  unions were represented. Such city-wide labor councils have been centers of 
  radical activity in other countries, but in 20th century America they have been 
  extremely weak. The very newness of most of the Seattle labor movement meant 
  that there had been little time for a local union leadership with its own interests 
  to separate itself off from the rank-and-file. Although the union leaders in 
  Seattle certainly had their doubts about the general strike, they did not actively 
  try to smash it--in marked contrast to union leaders&#8217; behavior in other 
  general strikes, notably in San Francisco in 1934. Thus while the workers of 
  Seattle had to create a new organ, the General Strike Committee, they did not 
  come into direct conflict with the existing union structure, precisely because 
  of the factors which made that structure unique.</p>
<p class="subtitle">LIMITATIONS OF THE STRIKE AND OF THE HISTORY</p>
<p>There were many limitations both in the thought and actions of the participants 
  in the Seattle General Strike and in this account of the Strike, which leaves 
  many important questions open. Perhaps most striking in the pamphlet is the 
  strong emphasis on the non-violence of the strike, its peaceful intent, its 
  maintenance of &#8220;law and order.&#8221; To some extent, this stress can 
  be explained by the fact that the History was written in part to serve as a 
  defense for many radicals and other participants who were arrested after the 
  strike was over. Also, it should be remembered that the author, who was one 
  of those arrested, was a &#8220;progressive&#8221; newspaper writer and not 
  a striking worker. However, it is true that the strike was entirely peaceful, 
  that from the beginning it was conceived in a peaceful framework, and that this 
  per shaped the development of the strike. Given the situation in Seattle, this 
  made sense. The strike was almost completely effective and thus did not require 
  mass picketing (which could lead to violence) to shut things down. There was 
  no possibility of successful revolutionary action, which would have involved 
  armed struggle, in as small and isolated a place as Seattle, whose workers were 
  more radical than those in most other parts of the country it would have been 
  bloodily crushed by the much stronger forces of reaction. What is objectionable 
  in the Strike History is the emphasis on peacefulness, its elevation to a principle 
  rather than a tactic to what extent this was shared by the participants we do 
  not know. </p>
<p>Also strange is the attitude towards the Japanese workers expressed here. The 
  Japanese workers had also gone on strike and were invited to send delegates 
  to the General Strike Committee, but with no vote. It is unclear what the context 
  of this decision was, but this might have been a serious and potentially destructive 
  limitation in the class-consciousness of those who made the decision. The pamphlet 
  fails to give much information on what the Wobblies (the Industrial Workers 
  of the World) and other radicals did during the strike, what role they played, 
  or what had been the effect of their years of activity and propaganda (some 
  of it about &#8220;The General Strike&#8221;) on the participants The Wobblies 
  were especially active in the shipyards. But the general strike was by no means 
  a Wobbly creation, as some people have portrayed it.<br>
  Because of its early date, the pamphlet does not tell much about what happened 
  after the strike. The account Anna Louise Strong gives in her autobiography 
  is discouraging, although apparently accurate. She notes that the economic crisis 
  of 1920-21 came to Seattle a year before it came to other cities. The Seattle 
  shipyards closed a year earlier than the yards of Hog Island and San Francisco 
  which also worked on government orders; perhaps by accident, perhaps because 
  of &#8220;shrewd men in the East who decided that &#8216;red Seattle&#8217; 
  must be tamed.&#8217; She continues, &#8216;our shipyard workers drifted to 
  other cities to look for work. The young, the daring, the best fighters went 
  ... The life died out of a dozen &#8216;workers&#8217; enterprises&#8217; which 
  were part of our &#8216;inevitable road to socialism.&#8217; Over-expanded cooperatives 
  went bankrupt in a storm of recriminations Workers fought each other for jobs 
  and not the capitalists for power.&#8221;</p>
<p>Would it have made any difference if the strike had gone farther, had lasted 
  longer, managed more enterprises, been willing to resort to violence? Probably 
  not. Of more significance is the question: to what extent was the decline of 
  the workers movement in Seattle (and in other places throughout the country) 
  a direct result of the economic crisis, as Strong suggests, and to what extent 
  were other factors involved?</p>
<p>One of the major problems of the workers in the strike was their leaders. This 
  is recognized in the pamphlet and a fair amount of information is given concerning 
  it, mostly about the attempts of the national unions to force their Seattle 
  locals to break the strike There is much that can be added from other sources 
  as well Seattle&#8217;s union leadership was notoriously radical Yet the decision 
  to strike was made while most of the &#8220;labor leaders&#8221; were at a special 
  conference in Chicago to organize a national general strike to free Tom Mooney 
  [Root &amp; Branch note According to one of them, Strong, the general strike 
  would probably not have occurred if they had been in town &#8220;They were terrified 
  when they heard that a general strike had been voted.... It might easily smash 
  something--us, perhaps, our well- organized labor movement.&#8221; They went 
  along with the General Strike because it was happening and in the hopes of controlling 
  where it went and bringing it to a speedy conclusion. The established union 
  leaders never did manage to gain control of the strike, but they had more and 
  more influence as the strike went on Strong also pointed out that as soon as 
  any worker was made a leader he wanted to end that strike a score of times in 
  those 5 days I saw it happen Workers in the ranks felt the thrill of massed 
  power which they trusted their leaders to carry to victory But as soon as one 
  of these workers was put on a responsible committee, he also wished to stop 
  &#8216;before there is riot and blood.&#8217; The strike could produce no leaders 
  willing to keep it going. All of us were red in the ranks and yellow as leaders.&#8221;</p>
<p>This situation was dramatized when the Executive Committee voted 13 to 1 on 
  Saturday (the third day of the strike) to recommend ending the strike that night. 
  The 300 members of the General Strike Committee were almost persuaded until 
  they took a supper break and talked with members of their own rank-and-file; 
  they returned to the meeting and voted overwhelmingly to continue the strike. 
  All of this suggests that the problem was not one of &#8220;bad&#8221; or &#8220;yellow&#8221; 
  leaders, but was inherent in the division between &#8220;leaders&#8221; and 
  &#8220;led&#8221;. The strikers could continue only insofar as they kept decisions 
  in their own hands.</p>
<p>For us, one of the most important questions in any strike is to what extent 
  do the participating men and women take over direction of their activities themselves, 
  and to what extent are they simply following the directives of an alternative 
  elite A strike committee, for example, can be only a means by which different 
  groups of workers coordinate their activity; on the other hand, it can be a 
  new directing authority. Many questions about decision-making in the Seattle 
  strike are not answered by the Official History.</p>
<p>Who was on the General Strike Committee of 300 and the Executive Committee 
  of 15? Were they rank-and-filers or leaders? If the former (as turned out to 
  be the case) what was their position and level of activity in the A.F.L. unions? 
  Did the rank-and-file ever meet during the strike&#8217; When did the delegates 
  on the General Strike Committee consult them?</p>
<p>From other books, we have gathered that there were union meetings during the 
  strike and that these union meetings, unlike most today or even most A.F.L. 
  union meetings outside Seattle at that time, did allow some kind of democracy 
  and communication--the rank-and- file really could control what happened to 
  a fair degree</p>
<p>Also it is probably true that the 30,000 rank-and-file workers a day who participated 
  in the mass meals that had been arranged discussed the strike with each other 
  at these meals. This was most likely the major way in which mass pressure was 
  put on the Strike Committee members, many of whom came to these meals. (Most 
  of these questions are not answered in any other accounts of the strike either.)</p>
<p>Exactly who ran those services that were run by &#8220;workers&#8221; during 
  the strike? Were they the local union leaders? Were they workers elected from 
  the rank-and-file? Were the decisions about how to run things made at mass meetings? 
  If done by delegates, to what extent did they contact the rest of the workers 
  about doing these things?</p>
<p>These are important questions to ask, about what for us was perhaps the most 
  important aspect of the General Strike. Workers&#8217; management is the basis 
  of the socialist society we hope to see created and to help and immediately 
  recallable delegates when not, and then only after full discussion of the crucial 
  issues by those to whom the delegate is responsible. (For one view of this see 
  Root &amp; Branch Pamphlet #1, Workers Councils by Anton Pannekoek.)<br>
  It will also mean a drastic change in peoples&#8217; daily lives and relationships.</p>
<p>This brings us to another set of questions left unanswered by the pamphlet. 
  What did the participants do with their time? To what extent did they just sit 
  at home (except for the mass meals, which maybe half of them came to) or have 
  a vacation, as some of the strike bulletins told them to do? How were their 
  daily lives and relationships with friends, family, coworkers affected?</p>
<p class="subtitle">GENERAL STRIKES TODAY</p>
<p>Finally, while it is useful for us today to study what happened during the 
  Seattle General Strike, what problems the workers faced and how they tried to 
  solve them, it is important also to point out the respects in with the situation 
  and thus the problems are different today (and were different, in most places 
  outs in 1919 as well). As we have already pointed out, the Seattle union movement 
  was uniquely democratic even for its own time. A general strike today would 
  probably have to be wildcat, in opposition to, fought by, and out of the control 
  of the union bureaucracy. This is because most unions are bureaucratic, hierarchical 
  structures which allow little meaningful participation of rank-and-file members. 
  Their function is to act as middlemen in the labor market: insuring employers 
  a quiet and docile labor force between contracts, and at contract time making 
  sure that both the demands and the methods used to win them, whether &#8220;collective 
  bargaining&#8221; or strikes, do not threaten the system. These features seem 
  to be inherent in the nature of modern trade unions.</p>
<p>A second difference is that the U.S. government would most likely play a more 
  active and repressive role in fighting a general strike today. In fact it was 
  very unusual for 1919 that there was not more repression and violence on the 
  part of the employers and the government.</p>
<p>Third, a general strike now would probably require much more mass participation 
  both in decision-making and in physical activity. The former because a general 
  strike would be done in conflict with the union structures and workers would 
  have to build new organizations to run the strike (which at the outset, at a 
  minimum, would probably mean mass participation), the latter because most cities 
  or areas create. But workers&#8217; management does not mean appointing leaders 
  to make all the decisions, even if these leaders are workers, It means that 
  workers make those decisions that affect them (in the area of production, these 
  decisions would be: what is produced, how is it produced, by whom, and how is 
  it distributed). These decisions should be made directly when possible, by rotated 
  now are not as isolated as Seattle was, and it would be necessary, even if the 
  strike was totally effective within the city or area, to have mass picketing 
  and related activities in order to stop shipments coming into the city or area 
  from the outside and to prevent the use of troops as strikebreakers. These are 
  the ideas that have occurred to us in connection with the pamphlet. Other people 
  approaching it from different perspectives and experiences would naturally have 
  other questions and thoughts.</p>
<p class="title">THE SEATTLE GENERAL STRIKE</p>
<p class="author">Originally printed by the History Committee of the General 
  Strike Committee, March 1919. History Committee: May Young (waitress), John

<p class="subtitle">INTRODUCTION</p>
<p>From coast to coast went the report that a revolution was imminent in Seattle. 
  A General Strike had been called in sympathy with the shipyard workers, and 
  no one knew what would come of it. Both before and after the strike, government 
  officials in Washington and other prominent persons declared that Bolshevism 
  had attempted to make its first appearance in the Northwest. In Seattle itself 
  the tension before the General Strike is difficult to describe. Business men 
  took out riot insurance on their warehouses and purchased guns. The press appealed 
  to the strikers not to ruin their home city. Later they changed their tone and 
  became more threatening, appealing to the strikers to state &#8220;which flag 
  they were under,&#8221; and if under the American flag, to put down Bolshevism 
  in their midst.</p>
<p>Many opponents of organized labor hoped to see the Labor Movement of Seattle 
  broken by the attempt to handle a General Strike, and many old-timers in the 
  labor Movement feared that this would indeed happen.</p>
<p>Meantime the people of the city acquired supplies for a long siege. Grocery 
  stores sold enormous quantities of goods. Hardware stores ransacked their storehouses 
  for discarded supplies of lamps of the sort used by last summer&#8217;s resorters 
  in beach camps, and sold them out at a substantial advance in price. A few of 
  the wealthy families were reported in the press as having moved to Portland, 
  to be out of the &#8220;upheaval.&#8221;</p>
<p>And yet, when the strike occurred, never had there been less outward turmoil 
  in the city of Seattle. Ordinary police-court arrests sank below normal. Quiet 
  reigned throughout the city. Even the ordinary meetings of radical groups were 
  voluntarily suspended lest they give an opportunity to some one to start trouble. 
  In short, as a reporter from a nearby town declared &#8220;while the authorities 
  prepared for riots, labor organized for peace and order.&#8221; And peace and 
  order obtained.</p>
<p>Now that the strike has passed into history, it is the purpose of this account 
  to gather up the information in scattered documents, in the press, and in the 
  minutes of the strike committee and relate what happened during the strike in 
  the labor world of Seattle. We do this because the General Strike is a new weapon 
  to the workers of the United States. Before our strike occurred, we did not 
  know how the weapon which we held in our hands would &#8220;go off.&#8221; And 
  we have gained an experience which we believe will be of use to the Labor Movement 
  of our country.</p>
<p>In the uncertainty and tension before the strike occurred, when no one knew 
  exactly what might come of it, the statement that &#8220;this is not a strike 
  but a revolution&#8221; was first made by the mayor of Seattle. It was the morning 
  paper, the Post-lntelligencer, which first publicly announced the alleged &#8220;Bolshevik&#8221; 
  character of the strike, in a cartoon showing the red flag hoisted above the 
  stars and stripes in the city of Seattle. </p>
<p>To what extent Revolution was or was not in the minds Of workers participating 
  in the strike, will be discussed later, after the actual happenings of the strike 
  have been made clearer. But since an editorial published in the Union Record 
  (the official daily organ of the Central Labor Council) the day before the strike, 
  has been quoted in partial form from coast to coast, as a sign of revolutionary 
  intentions, we give it here in full:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>On Thursday at 10 A.M.</p>
  <p>There will be many cheering, and there will be some who fear. Both these 
    emotions are useful, but not too much of either. Ware undertaking the most 
    tremendous move ever made by LABOR in this country, a move which will lead--NO 
    ONE KNOWS WHERE! We do not need hysteria. We need the iron march of labor.</p>
  <p>LABOR WILL FEED THE PEOPLE. Twelve great kitchens have been offered, and 
    from them food will be distributed by the provision trades at low cost to 
    all. LABOR WILL CARE FOR THE BABIES AND THE SICK. The milk- wagon drivers 
    and the laundry drivers are arranging plans for supplying milk to babies, 
    invalids, and hospitals, and taking care of the cleaning of linen for hospitals. 
    LABOR WILL PRESERVE ORDER. The strike committee is arranging for guards, and 
    it is expected that the stopping of the cars will keep people at home. A few 
    hot-headed enthusiasts have complained that strikers only should be fed, and 
    the general public left to endure severe discomfort. Aside from the in-humanitarian 
    character of such suggestions, let them get this straight: NOT THE WITHDRAWAL 
    OF LABOR POWER, BUT THE POWER OF THE STRIKERS TO MANAGE WILL WIN THIS STRIKE. 
    What does Mr. Piez of the Shipping Board care about the closing down of Seattle&#8217;s 
    shipyards, or even of all the industries of the northwest? Will it not merely 
    strengthen the yards at Hog Island, in which he is more interested?</p>
  <p>When the shipyard owners of Seattle were on the point of agreeing with the 
    workers, it was Mr. Piez who wired them that, if they so agreed he would not 
    let them have steel. Whether this is camouflage we have no means of knowing 
    but we do know that the great eastern combinations of capitalists could afford 
    to offer privately to Mr. Skinner, Mr. Ames, and Mr. Duthie a few millions 
    apiece in eastern shipyard stock, RATHER THAN LET THE WORKERS WIN.</p>
  <p>The closing down of Seattle&#8217;s industries, as a MERE SHUTDOWN, will 
    not affect these eastern gentlemen much. They could let the whole northwest 
    go to pieces, as far as money alone is concerned.</p>
  <p>But, the closing down of the capitalistically controlled industries of Seattle, 
    while the workers organize to feed the people, to care for the babies and 
    the sick, to preserve order--this will move them, for this looks too much 
    like the taking over of power by the workers.</p>
  <p>Labor will not only Shut Down the industries, but Labor will reopen, under 
    the management of the appropriate trades, such activities as are needed to 
    preserve public health and public peace. If the strike continues, Labor may 
    feel led to avoid public suffering by reopening more and more activities UNDER 
    ITS OWN MANAGEMENT. And that is why we say that we are starting on a road 
    that leads, no one knows where!</p>

<p>This editorial was perhaps more variously interpreted than any statement made 
  during the strike. The Post-Intelligencer published it the next morning and 
  made no further comment. And perhaps comment is needless, since each man will 
  interpret it according to his own intentions.</p>
<p>It might be mentioned, however, that the editorial was submitted, as were all 
  matters affecting the strike, to the members of the Conference-Committee of 
  the Metal Trades, before it was published. And at the very time when it was 
  being held aloft as the banner of revolution, by the capitalist press of the 
  country, members of Labor and other liberal minded citizens of Seattle were 
  declaring that here at last was, out of the turmoil, a Suggestion of some truly 
  constructive attainment that might come out of the General Strike.</p>
<p>For the mood of Labor, as the General Strike drew near, was one of deep seriousness. 
  They knew that they were facing a situation as yet untried, and they did not 
  know what would result from it, of good or bad, for the City of Seattle and 
  the labor movement in that city.</p>
<p>What did come out of it, as will be seen as the story proceeds, was precisely 
  what was hoped for in this editorial, &#8221;more and more activities under 
  the management of labor.&#8221; The stimulus to cooperative enterprise and to 
  the enthusiastic working together of unions was the most important, permanent 
  and constructive result of the General Strike. To supplement the editorial given 
  above, we call attention to the two Anise verses printed as an appendix to this 
  book [ which only one, They Can&#8217;t Understand, was reprinted by Root &amp; 
  Branch], and also to an editorial printed in the Union Record some weeks after 
  the strike, of which we quote only parts:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Concerning Revolution</p>
  <p>We are growing tired of explaining that we didn&#8217;t mean this and that; 
    we are weary of seeming to take the negative explanatory attitude in connection 
    with a faith of which we are proud, a faith which adds meaning to our lives. 
    We want to tell, in positive words, the glorious thing we do mean.</p>
  <p>If by revolution is meant violence, forcible taking over of property, the 
    killing or maiming of men, surely no group of workers dreamed of such action. 
    But if by revolution is meant that a Great Change is coming over the face 
    of the world, which will transform our method of carrying on industry, and 
    will go deep into the very sources of our lives, to bring joy and freedom 
    in place of heaviness and fear--then we do believe in such a Great Change 
    and that our General Stake was one very definite step towards it.</p>
  <p>We look about us today and see a world of industrial unrest, of owners set 
    against workers, of strikes and lockouts, of mutual suspicions. We see a world 
    of strife and insecurity, of unemployment, and hungry children. It is not 
    a pleasant world to look upon. Surely no one desires that it should continue 
    in this most painful unrest.<br>
    We see but one way out. In place of two classes competing for the fruits of 
    industry, there must be, eventually ONLY ONE CLASS sharing fairly the good 
    things of the world. And this can only be done by the workers learning to 
    manage.</p>
  <p>When we saw in our General Strike: The Milk Wagon Drivers consulting late 
    into the night over the task of supplying milk for the city&#8217;s babies; 
    The Provision Trades working twenty-four hours out of the twenty-four on the 
    question of feeding 30,000 workers; The Barbers planning a chain of co-operative 
    barber shops; The steamfitters opening a profitless grocery store; The Labor 
    Guards facing, under severe provocation, the task of maintaining order by 
    a new and kinder method; When we saw union after union submitting its cherished 
    desires to the will of the General Strike Committee: then we rejoiced. For 
    we knew it was worth the four or five days pay apiece to get this education 
    in the problems of management. Whatever strength we found in ourselves, and 
    whatever weakness, we knew we were learning the thing which it is necessary 
    for us to know.</p>
  <p>Someday, when the workers have learned to manage, they will begin managing. 
    And we, the workers of Seattle, have seen, in the midst of our General Strike, 
    vaguely and across the storm, a glimpse of what the fellowship of that new 
    day shall be.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="subtitle">THE SHIPYARDS STRIKE</p>
<p>The General Strike in Seattle grew out of the strike of some 35,000 shipyard 
  workers for higher wages. The Seattle shipyards are on a basis of closed shop 
  and collective bargaining between the various yard-owners and the Metal Trades 
  Council of Seattle. The Council is composed of delegates from twenty-one different 
  craft unions, (seventeen at the time of the first strike vote). These separate 
  unions no longer make separate agreements with the yard-owners; a single blanket-agreement 
  is made at intervals by the Metal Trades Council for all the crafts comprising 
  it. This was the situation before the United States entered the war.</p>
<p>In August 1917 the workers had succeeded in establishing a uniform scale of 
  wages for one-third of the Metal Trades men working in the city. Some of the 
  ship yards were unable to reach an agreement on account of having clauses in 
  their contracts with the government preventing them from raising wages without 
  the government&#8217;s consent. The Macy board came out on the Coast to adjust 
  the wages and instead of bringing about uniformity in the wage scale through 
  their system of applying the increased cost of living to wages received that 
  had been brought about through collective bargaining, applied the increase to 
  the wages received the year before and owing to some of the crafts having been 
  in a disorganized condition at that period and others having been organized 
  and in a position to maintain their standards, the application of the increase 
  gave some crafts 60 cents per day more than they had requested and the great 
  majority of basic ship yard trades 22 cents per day less than they were receiving 
  in the other yards and shops Making a difference of 82 cents per day between 
  the crafts which created dissatisfaction from the very start.</p>
<p>There was bitter opposition to this among the Seattle workers, who saw themselves 
  deprived of advantages gained by long years of organization and struggle. But 
  the International Officers of various crafts involved had signed the memorandum 
  creating the Macy Board, and the men, while protesting, and refrained from striking 
  for patriotic reasons, because of the war needs of the country. The Seattle 
  workers maintained that according to the constitution of the various craft unions, 
  the International Officers of the various crafts had no authority thus to bind 
  their locals, without a referendum vote. This was felt all the more keenly as 
  the local crafts had themselves given over their rights to the Metal Trades 
  Council, in order that they might bargain for the entire industry at once, and 
  they felt that power was wrongfully taken from the instrument they had built 
  for their own protection.</p>
<p>For more than a year they continued work, though under constant protest against 
  the fairness of the agreement, to which they constantly stated they had not 
  been a party. Appeal after appeal was made, with no result. While continuing 
  at work, the Seattle shipyard workers established world records in the building 
  of ships. So great was their efficiency that official records state that 26 
  percent of all ships built for the United States Shipping Board during the war 
  were built in Seattle alone.</p>
<p>After the armistice was signed, and after repeated failure to get relief through 
  appeals, the various crafts of the Metal Trades took a strike vote by referendum. 
  According to the strong conviction of the Seattle unions, in voting on these 
  matters each worker should count as one, no matter in which union he belongs. 
  According to the constitution of the various international organizations and 
  the Metal Trades Department of the American Federation of Labor, however, the 
  vote is counted by crafts, and requires a majority of the crafts represented 
  in order to settle an issue. Thus in Seattle, where the boilermakers and Shipbuilders&#8217; 
  Union is about as large as the other twenty put together, it would have only 
  one vote in twenty-one. The majority of men in the yards might be overwhelmingly 
  one way and the majority of craft unions might be the other way.</p>
<p>In this particular case, however, the majority, counted either way, was in 
  favor of the strike. Ten of the seventeen craft unions declared for the strike, 
  each according to its own constitution, which in some cases required two-thirds, 
  in other cases a three-fourths vote. Of the remaining seven unions, only one 
  failed to secure a majority vote for the strike. In counting the majority of 
  workers the desire for the strike was even more noticeable, since it was precisely 
  in the large unions that the vote went strong for the strike.</p>
<p>The vote was counted on December 10, 1918, and was announced and held by the 
  Metal Trades Council to use whenever they decided the time had come.</p>
<p>Meantime attempts at negotiation were continued. Failing to secure satisfaction, 
  on Thursday evening, January 16, the strike was called to take effect the following 
  Tuesday morning. The Tacoma Metal Trades Council took the same action.</p>
<p>The demands of the men were $8.00 per day for mechanics, $7.00 for specialists 
  of semi-skilled mechanics, $6.00 for helpers with a scale of $5.50 for laborers, 
  eight hours per day, and forty-four hours per week. This demand, however, was 
  not final insofar as the vote was concerned and had there been a compromise 
  offered affecting all men in the yards in the same proportion it would have 
  been necessary to resubmit the vote to the membership for acceptance or rejection.</p>
<p>Many evidences point to the fact that it was the raise in pay for the lower-paid 
  men which was most desired. Many of the skilled men were already getting more 
  than the minimum asked under the new scale. They were, however, strong in their 
  advocacy of the strike on account of the condition of the laborers. It is stated, 
  on many good authorities, that Seattle businessmen, and especially Seattle landlords, 
  had taken occasion to profiteer to a greater degree than in other places along 
  the coast, and that consequently the cost of living in Seattle had increased 
  far above that in Los Angeles and other California points. This bore hardest 
  on the lower paid men.</p>
<p>The Conference Committee which had, conferred with the employers reported that 
  the yard owners were willing to grant an increase to the skilled mechanics but 
  not to the lower paid helpers. The men stood together in their unwillingness 
  to accept such an agreement, regarding this as a bribe to induce the skilled 
  men to desert their brothers. The shipyard workers came out and the yards closed 
  down, making no attempt whatever to run.</p>
<p>Special reference must be made to the attitude of Charles Piez, Director General 
  of the Emergency Fleet Corporation. During war time, while ostensibly admitting 
  the right of the workers to bargain collectively with their employers, he informed 
  the Seattle yard-owners that if they gave in to the demands of their workers, 
  he would not let them have steel.</p>
<p>When the appellate board, which reviewed the decision of the Macy Board, ended 
  in a deadlock, Piez told James Taylor president of the Metal Trades Council 
  and local representative of the Seattle workers with the Macy Board that the 
  men were free to deal directly with their employers. He later confirmed this 
  statement by telegram to Mr. Skinner of Skinner &amp; Eddy Corporation, and 
  in an interview to Mr. Ashmun Brown, published in the Post-Intelligencer of 
  January 24th.</p>
<p>But when the yard-owners and the workers took him at his word and entered into 
  conference, he again threatened the yard-owners, this time with the withdrawal 
  of contracts, in case they changed the wage scale.</p>
<p>This attitude continued throughout the strike. In a most perplexing manner 
  one telegram from Mr. Piez stated that the yard-owners were free to make their 
  own dealings with the men and that he had no power to prevent them: another 
  stated that government contracts would be denied any yards which changed the 
  rate of wages: still another stated that as far as he was concerned the government 
  would not allow, even later, any raise in the war-time wages.</p>
<p>Throughout the strike, he seemed consistent only on one point-- that he would 
  have no dealings whatever with the men until they had returned to work.</p>
<p class="subtitle">SYMPATHETIC STRIKE ASKED FOR</p>
<p>The strike of the shipyard workers occurred on Tuesday morning, January 2 1st. 
  On the following evening, at the meeting of the Central Labor Council, a delegate 
  body composed of representatives from all the unions in the city, including 
  the unions of the Metal Trades, a request was presented from the Metal Trades 
  Council, asking for a General Strike throughout the city, in sympathy with the 
  shipyard workers.</p>
<p>This request was approved by the Central Labor Council and went out to the 
  various unions to vote on, as they hold the final authority in case of a strike 
  of their members. On the following Sunday, a meeting of executive officers of 
  local unions was held which recommended to the Central Labor Council that the 
  General Strike, if it should be favorably voted upon, should be governed by 
  a Strike Committee, composed of three delegates elected from each striking union, 
  and that this General strike Committee should be called to meet on the following 
  Sunday.</p>
<p>By the next Wednesday meeting of the Central Labor Council, so many unions 
  had declared their intention to strike, that the suggestion of the executive 
  officers of unions was accepted and a General Strike Committee called to meet 
  on Sunday morning, February 2nd, at 8 o&#8217;clock. This General Strike Committee 
  composed of delegates from 110 unions and the Central Labor Council, held the 
  ultimate authority on all strike matters during the time of the sympathetic 
  strike.</p>
<p><em><strong>Some of the striking unions</strong></em></p>
<p>The completeness with which the unions of Seattle voted for the General Strike 
  came as a surprise to many unionists. Union after union sacrificed cherished 
  hopes, &#8220;in order to go out with the rest.&#8221; The Longshoremen&#8217;s 
  Union, in which, after many vicissitudes, the Truckers had at length combined 
  with the Riggers and Stevedores, had just put through a closed-shop agreement 
  for the waterfront of Seattle which was seriously imperiled and in fact, broken 
  down, by their participation in the General strike.</p>
<p>The Street Car Men were 100 per cent organized, after a long and bitter fight 
  which had included a street car strike. They were looking forward at last, at 
  last, after a year of waiting, to some fruit from their labors. Poorly paid, 
  and with long hours, they expected a decision to be handed down from the Supreme 
  Court of the State, and on the very day after the date set for the General Strike, 
  which would assure them a substantial advance in wages. All this seemed to them 
  endangered. Yet a majority of them voted in favor of standing with the rest 
  of labor. And although the Street Car Men were later among the first unions 
  to go back, at the orders of their executive committee and an international 
  officer, yet even the most radical union men, knowing the pressure under which 
  they labored, were inclined to urge:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be too hard on those boys: they risked a great deal.&#8221; 
    Many weak unions, knowing that they risked their jobs as individuals and their 
    existence as unions, yet took this chance and went out with the rest. Among 
    these were the Hotel Maids, the Cereal and Flour Mill Workers, the Renton 
    Car Builders.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Over against these were the votes of the old and conservative unions, unused 
  to indulging in sympathetic strikes or &#8220;in demonstrations.&#8221; The 
  most unusual was perhaps the vote of the Typographical Union, a union whose 
  control of its own jobs has been for years so strong that strikes have fallen 
  into disuse in its organization. Yet it gave a majority vote in favor of striking, 
  although its strike was not allowed by its International, as it failed to get 
  the required three fourths votes.</p>
<p>The Musicians&#8217; Union, another conservative union, took two votes. It 
  was almost S to I against the idea of the General Strike, but 6 to I in favor 
  of striking with the rest of organized labor, in case the others decided to 
  go out. In other words, it stood for solidarity even against its own preferences.</p>
<p>The Carpenters&#8217; Union, 131, an old, conservative union, which has become 
  one of the &#8220;big businesses&#8221; of the city, due to its ownership of 
  a very profitable building, voted for the strike by a majority of &#8220;better 
  than 2 to I.&#8221; &#8220;There was no one down there haranguing us, either,&#8221; 
  said one of the members. &#8220;We wouldn&#8217;t have stood for it. We took 
  a secret ballot and decided to strike; and then we put our fate in the hands 
  of the Strike Committee and stuck till the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Teamsters&#8217; strike is remarkable because of the great pressure under 
  which they labored. It is stated that 800 calls came into their office during 
  the strike, from members of their own and other unions, complaining that fuel 
  had given out and that they could not get any heat on account of the strike 
  of the Teamsters. Many people realized for the first time how this union, which 
  handles the transportation of freight in a modern city, is at the basis of all 
  the city&#8217;s activities.</p>
<p>These are only a few of the unions striking; others will be mentioned in connection 
  with activities which they carried on. But these are sufficient to show the 
  great variety of crafts which sank their own interests for the sake of the sympathetic 
  strike in Seattle.</p>
<p>It is interesting to note, in passing, that among the few unions which did 
  not go on strike were various groups of government employees. Workers in the 
  Post Office Department stated on the floor of the Central Labor Council that 
  the regulations were such that they practically faced jail for striking. Thus 
  for the first time, the Labor Movement in Seattle was brought face to face with 
  the fact that government ownership may mean, not greater freedom for the workers 
  but greater rigidity of regulations, and less freedom for the individuals employed 
  than does even private ownership.</p>
<p class="subtitle">ORGANIZING FOR THE STRIKE</p>
<p>Four days before the strike actually took place; the meetings of the General 
  Strike Committee began. With their first session on Sunday, February 2, 1919, 
  authority over the strike passed from the Central Labor Council, which had sent 
  out the call, and from the Metal Trades Council, which had asked it, and was 
  centered in a committee of over 300 members, elected from 110 local unions and 
  the Central Labor Council, for the express purpose of managing the strike.</p>
<p>The first meeting was called to order at 8:35 in the morning, and continued 
  in session until 9:35 that evening, with short intermissions for meals. From 
  this time on until the close of the strike, there were meetings daily and at 
  almost all hours of day and night, of either this General Strike Committee, 
  or of the Executive Committee of Fifteen to which it delegated some of its authority. 
  The volume of business transacted was tremendous; practically every aspect of 
  the city&#8217;s life came before the strike committee for some decision.</p>
<p>A general strike was seen, almost at once, to differ profoundly from any of 
  the particular strikes with which the workers of Seattle were familiar. It was 
  not enough, as some of the hasty enthusiasts declared, to &#8220;just walk out.&#8221; 
  The strikers were at once brought face to face with the way in which the whole 
  community, including their own families, is inextricably tied together. If life 
  was not to be made unbearable for the strikers themselves, problems of management, 
  of selection and exemption, had to take the place of the much simpler problem 
  of keeping everyone out of work.</p>
<p>The strikers had no quarrel with the city of Seattle or with its inhabitants, 
  of whom they themselves and their families comprised perhaps half. They had 
  no particular quarrel with the city government, and most of them took pride 
  in the municipally owned light and water and garbage systems, the municipal 
  car line and the public port. While they were doubtless deeply touched by that 
  spirit of unrest and desire for a new world which is sweeping the world today, 
  they had no definite revolutionary intentions.</p>
<p>Consequently the problems of what should be done about the water supply, the 
  lighting system, the hospitals, the babies&#8217; milk supply, came before a 
  committee of quiet working people whose stake in all these things was as great 
  as that of any persons in the city and who, while they intended to make a tremendous 
  and solid demonstration of sympathy with their brothers in the shipyards, had 
  at the same time no desire to wreck the city&#8217;s life.</p>
<p>They realized that they were undertaking something new in the American labor 
  movement; they were not quite certain where it would lead; but they felt themselves 
  strong enough to handle whatever problems might arise.</p>
<p class="subtitle">The Committee Organizes</p>
<p>To make the problem harder, the General Strike Committee was not, like the 
  Central Labor Council, composed of delegates who had experience in working together. 
  They were a new group, a very large and unwieldy mass of unacquainted individuals, 
  upon whom, almost at once, great and momentous questions descended.</p>
<p>The quantity of business transacted and the businesslike attention to many 
  aspects of complicated questions, is shown in the minutes of the committee, 
  and indicates a much higher level of efficiency and business-like methods that 
  could normally be expected from such a large governing group.</p>
<p>The morning session of the first day was taken up with passing on credentials. 
  Eighty unions, in addition to the 21 unions of the Metal Trades, presented acceptable 
  credentials at this meeting. A few other unions were added later, making 110 
  in all.</p>
<p>All unions which had voted to strike, or which belonged to a district council 
  which was striking as a unit, were granted three delegates. A few of the officials 
  of the labor movement were granted seats in the meeting by special vote. Several 
  irregular credentials were turned down. The first appearance of the inevitable 
  problem of the relation of the strike to the city authorities occurred when 
  the Garbage Wagon</p>
<p>Drivers asked for permission to explain why they had voted against the strike. 
  They stated that Dr. McBride, the health commissioner of Seattle, had told them 
  that they must take care of the hospitals and sanitariums, subject to penalty 
  under the law. They had not known whether the strike committee would make any 
  exemption in favor of these emergency needs, and so had voted not to strike. 
  Later the Garbage Wagon Drivers&#8217; delegates were seated and certain exemptions 
  were made in the interests of health.</p>
<p>Another fundamental problem which raised its head in this first meeting was 
  the opposition of officers of international unions. The stereotypers stated 
  that one of their international officers was in the city and would probably 
  try to force them back to work. They wanted to know what support the unions 
  of Seattle could give them in case their international officers supplied men 
  to fill their places and otherwise disciplined them. The committee declared 
  that the sympathetic strike would not be called off until the stereotypers were 
  reinstated in any positions lost as the result of striking.</p>
<p>The date on which the strike should be called came in for much discussion, 
  it was finally decided to fix the following Thursday, February 6, at 10 a.m., 
  and to ask Tacoma and Aberdeen to postpone the general strike, which they had 
  ordered, until the time agreed on by Seattle. An executive committee of fifteen 
  was next appointed to work with the metal trades committee in formulating a 
  plan of action, and to present this to the Central Labor Council on the following 
  Wednesday evening. Almost at once other motions made this committee permanent 
  and instructed it to consider all questions of exemption that might arise in 
  the handling of the general strike. The decisions of this committee were at 
  times subject to appeal by the General Strike Committee, but in practice, repeal 
  was not found necessary Committees on publicity, on finance and on tactics were 
  also appointed, and many other minor matters of business were disposed of Among 
  these were the forwarding of a resolution to Washington, D C, demanding the 
  removal of Mr Piez of the shipping board, and the adoption of a resolution that 
  no officer or committeeman should receive any salary during the strike.</p>
<p>Just at the close of the meeting two slogans were suggested. &#8220;We have 
  nothing to lose but our chains and a whole world to gain&#8221; was rejected 
  in favor of &#8220;Together We Win.&#8221; The unions of Seattle were declaring 
  in favor of labor&#8217;s solidarity; they were not declaring in favor of the 
  well known phrases of the class war.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Executive Committee Organizes</p>
<p>Even while the first meeting of the General Strike Committee was going on, 
  the newly appointed Executive Committee of Fifteen met and prepared for business. 
  Brother Nauman, of the Hoisting Engineers, was elected chairman, and Brother 
  Egan, of the Barbers, secretary. Three subcommittees were appointed to consider 
  exemptions from the general strike order, under three main heads: Construction, 
  Transportation, and Provisions.</p><p>
  Committees on miscellaneous exemptions, on grievances and on general welfare 
  were also appointed.</p><p>
  The Cooks Union reported at this time that their arrangements for feeding the 
  strikers and the public were well under way. The executive committee decided 
  upon daily meetings. As a matter of fact, so many and so important were the 
  matters brought before them that they found themselves compelled to meet more 
  than once a day.</p><p class="subtitle"</p>
  First Exemption Granted.</p><p>
    On the following day, Monday, the Committee of Fifteen met again. Before them 
  came a delegation from the Firemen&#8217;s Local 27, whom they had requested 
  to appear. After some discussion the committee requested the firemen to stay 
  on the job. This was the first exemption granted in the strike. It was followed 
  by many more.</p><p>
  The transportation subcommittee was instructed to arrange for the necessary 
  forms of permit and signs to designate the autos and trucks used by organized 
  labor in carrying on the necessary activities of the strike. Here again the 
  necessity of exemption was recognized.</p><p>
  C.R. Case, head of the department of streets of the city of Seattle, was the 
  first department head to appear before the committee to state city needs. He 
  pointed out the fact that the water supply of Queen Anne Hill and West Seattle 
  depended on electrical help from the City Light and Power. He also stated that 
  large quantities of food in cold storage would spoil if the power system did 
  not run, and that without the street lights the city would be a prey to lawlessness 
  and disorder and thuggery. He mentioned the needs of gas in hospitals and laboratories, 
  and the need of transportation for the various city institutions.</p><p>
  The &#8216;Committee of Fifteen&#8217; realized what they were facing, if a 
  strike were carried through without exemptions. They appointed a special hour 
  on the following day at which they requested heads of city departments to appear 
  and state their needs, and they ex pressed as the sense of the committee that 
  they cooperate with these heads in every way possible.</p><p class="subtitle">
  Organization of Laundry Workers</p><p>
  One of the neatest little bits of team work between four different organizations 
  came up for approval at this first meeting of the executive committee of 15. 
  The Laundry Drivers&#8217; Union had at first voted not to strike, but later 
  changed their vote. They had a great deal to lose in any strike, as they had 
  built up laundry routes with much patience and the effort of many years. They 
  were working under an agreement with the Laundrymen&#8217;s Club, the organization 
  of laundry owners.</p><p>
  There was also in Seattle a Mutual Laundry, owned by organized labor, and the 
  question of its operation came to the fore. After consultation between the laundry 
  drivers and inside laundry workers, it was proposed that hospital laundry only 
  should be handled; that a certain number of wagons should be exempted and furnished 
  with signs and permits to serve the hospitals; that one laundry should be agreed 
  on as the one best qualified to handle hospital laundry and should be allowed 
  to operate under a permit, with a sign, &#8220;Hospital Laundry Only, by Order 
  of General Strike Committee.&#8221; This laundry should not be the Mutual Laundry, 
  which did not care to handle hospital work.</p><p>
  The laundry workers served notice to their employers to take no more laundry, 
  as it could not be finished, and then requested the Committee of Fifteen to 
  allow them to work a few hours past the time of the calling of the strike, in 
  order that the clothes already in the plants should not mildew from dampness.</p><p>
  A note from the Laundry Owners Club, accepting the Washington Laundry as the 
  one to be exempted, was also submitted, together with the rest of the requests 
  from the laundry drivers and laundry workers. It was a well-thought out program, 
  indicating complete agreement with the entire laundry industry, and it was accepted 
  by the Committee of Fifteen.</p><p class="subtitle">
  The Problem of the Butchers</p><p>
  The meat cutters presented an entirely different problem from that of the laundries. 
  Ir of a complete organization of the industry, they had a small and struggling 
  union, organized in a few shops, but unable to gain an entrance into some of 
  the big markets which were controlled by the representatives of the packers.</p><p>
  If they should strike, and withdraw their men from the little shops, which had 
  dealt fairly with the union, were they not penalizing their friends and strengthening 
  their enemies whose non-union shops would be running full blast?</p><p>
  The somewhat original and interesting solution proposed by the Committee of 
  Fifteen was that that the meat cutters should strike with the rest of labor, 
  and should then contribute their time without charge to supply the public with 
  meat through certain specified union shops, demanding only that the saving of 
  their wages be deducted from the cost of meat. In the end, the strike of the 
  meat cutters was incomplete, due to the handicap they labored under.</p><p class="subtitle">
  Law and Order Committee</p><p>
  By Tuesday noon, still two days before the strike, the need of a law and order 
  committee was felt to be pressing, and the Committee of Fifteen appointed a 
  committee of three to handle this matter. An advertisement was placed in the 
  Union Record asking that labor union men who had seen service in the United 
  States army or navy come to a meeting to discuss important strike work. This 
  was the beginning of the famous Labor&#8217;s War Veteran Guards, who did such 
  splendid service in preserving order during the strike.</p><p class="subtitle">
  Demands for Exemptions</p><p>
  Demands for exemptions came in thick and fast on Tuesday, now that the strike 
  was actually looming near. The proposed meeting with heads of city departments 
  never came off, but requests from several public officials came in formally 
  for exemptions. These were referred to their appropriate committees, considered, 
  returned with recommendations, and either granted or rejected. In some cases 
  a conditional grant led the Committee of Fifteen into the position of actually 
  prescribing the conduct of certain lines of activity. Here are a few selections 
  from Tuesday&#8217;s minutes:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> &#8220;King County commissioners ask for exemption of janitors to care for 
    City-County building. Not granted.&#8221;</p>
  <p> &#8220;F.A. Rust asks for janitors for Labor Temple. Not granted. (The committee 
    was playing no favorites: it is worth noting, however, that a few days later, 
    when the Co-operative Market asked for additional janitor help because of 
    the large amounts of food handles for the strikers&#8217; kitchens, their 
    request was allowed.)</p>
  <p> &#8220;Teamsters&#8217; Union asks permission to carry oil for Swedish hospital 
    during strike. Referred to transportation committee. Approved.&#8221;</p>
  <p> &#8220;Port of Seattle asks to be allowed men to load a governmental vessel, 
    pointing out that no private profits are involved and that an emergency exists. 
    Granted.&#8221; (Note: This was on a later date.)</p>
  <p> &#8220;Garbage Wagon Drivers ask for instructions. Referred to public welfare 
    committee, which recommends that such garbage as tends to create an epidemic 
    of disease be collected, but no ashes or papers. Garbage wagons were seen 
    on the streets after this with the sign, &#8216;Exempt by Strike Committee.&#8221;</p>
  <p> Drug Stores&#8212;Prescriptions Only</p>
  <p> &#8220;The retail drug clerks sent in statement of the health needs of the 
    city. Referred to public welfare committee, which recommends that prescription 
    counters only be left open, and that in front of every drug store which is 
    thus allowed to open a sign be placed with the words, &#8216;No goods sold 
    during general strike, Orders for prescriptions only will be filled. Signed 
    by general strike committee.&#8217;</p>
  <p> &#8220;Communication from House of Good Sheperd. Permission granted by transportation 
    committee to haul food and provisions only.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  This is by no means all the business that came before the Committee of Fifteen 
  in a single afternoon. An appointment of a committee of relief to look after 
  destitute homes, the creation of a publicity bureau, an order that watchmen 
  stay on the job until further notice, and many other matters were dealt with 
  and after this eventful afternoon there followed a night meeting at 10 p.m.</p><p class="subtitle">
  To Fix an End for the Strike</p><p>
  Should a final limit be fixed to the general strike? Or should it start to end--no 
  one knew where? This as the question discussed on Tuesday evening by the executive 
  meeting. Many of the older members of the labor movement frankly dreaded the 
  general strike. They saw in it even such Possibilities as the complete disruption 
  of Seattle&#8217;s labor movement. They urged that a definite time limit be 
  fixed to the sympathetic strike, with the threat to repeat it unless action 
  was secured on, the difficulties of the Metal Trades. Foremost among those urging 
  this limit was James Duncan, secretary of the Central Labor Council, and F. 
  B. Ault, editor of the Union Record.</p><p>
  The executive committee of the Metal Trades was at first reported as having 
  approved such a time limit, but after they had conferred with their general 
  conference committee, which refused to agree to the proposal, the Metal Trades 
  Council sent word shortly after midnight that they had no request to make. They 
  also stated that the mine workers of the state would be asked to strike and 
  that the State Federation of Labor would be requested to co-operate with the 
  strike.</p><p>
  The move to fix a time limit to the sympathetic strike consequently failed.</p><p class="subtitle">
  Take Over Printing Plant</p><p>
  On Wednesday the same grist of requests for exemptions and for directions came 
  before the Committee of Fifteen. The Trade Printery asked for exemption on the 
  ground that it was printed material needed by the various unions. The request 
  was denied, and the Trade Printery was asked instead to turn over its plant 
  to the strike committee, to be run by printers giving their services. To this 
  the Trade Printery agreed.</p><p>
  The day before this offer was made the Equity Printing Co. offered to put its 
  plant at the disposal of the strike committee, volunteering free labor. This 
  offer was favorably considered by a sub-committee, but rejected by the Committee 
  of Fifteen.</p><p>
  The auto drivers were given permission to carry &#8220;mail only&#8221; on the 
  Des Moines road. They were also allowed to answer emergency calls for hospitals 
  and funerals, provided those calls came through the Auto Drivers&#8217; Union.</p><p class="subtitle">
  Ministers Appeal</p><p>
  The Ministerial Federation sent representatives to see the Committee of Fifteen 
  on this day. After submitting the resolutions which they had already sent to 
  Mr. Piez and Woodrow Wilson as evidence of their sympathy with labor&#8217;s 
  cause, they formally requested postponement of the general strike for one week 
  to give a chance for peaceful settlement. They were given a rising vote of thanks 
  for their interest, but their request was not granted. The telephone girls were 
  requested to stay on the job temporarily.</p><p>
  The school janitors&#8217; request to remain on the job was refused, and they 
  ware referred to the Engineers&#8217; Union, which on the following Saturday 
  allowed them to return. Bake ovens at Davidson&#8217;s bakery were allowed to 
  operate, all wages to go into the general strike fund. This was the usual policy 
  adopted when union men were allowed to work for private employers in a matter 
  of public emergency.</p><p class="subtitle">
  THE QUESTION OF CITY LIGHT</p><p>
  The eventful Thursday drew near. One most important matter was still unsettled--the 
  question of city light. At the request of the Committee of Fifteen, Mayor Hanson 
  came to the Labor Temple to a night meeting for conference on the subject. The 
  meeting convened shortly before midnight, and the mayor arrived after midnight, 
  remaining until 3:30 in the morning of Thursday.</p><p>
  The electrical workers had voted to strike without exemptions. On the day before 
  the strike an interview purporting to be from Leon Green, their business agent, 
  appeared in the morning paper, announcing that not a single light would burn 
  in Seattle, and that the telephone system, the newspapers and every enterprise 
  depending on juice&#8221; would cease to run.</p><p class="subtitle">
  &#8220;No Exemptions&#8221;</p><p>
  To the question, &#8220;How about hospitals, where people may die for want of 
  light,&#8221; Green was stated to have replied, &#8220;No exemptions.&#8221; 
  The same answer was made to the question of the automatic fire alarm system. 
  More than any other one event during the entire strike, this front page report 
  of Green&#8217;s intentions aroused both fear and resentment, not only among 
  outsiders, but within the ranks of organized labor as well.</p><p>
  The mayor, who had previously taken no sides, announced that city light should 
  run, even if he had to bring in soldiers to run it. Appeals were made to the 
  public for volunteers to run the city light plant. And meanwhile the general 
  public, uncertain of the outcome, laid in supplies of oil lamps and candles.</p><p>
  The electricians took the ground that a complete tie-up would shorten the duration 
  of the strike. In answer to this the city authorities stated that the shutting 
  down of city power would shut off the water supply in West Seattle and on Queen 
  Anne Hill; would mean the spoiling of large quantities of food in the cold storage 
  warehouses, while the darkening of the streets would inevitably lead to disorder, 
  and the shutting off of lights from the hospitals might mean many deaths.</p><p>
  All committees Much Concerned</p><p>
  The various committees dealing with the strike were all deeply concerned. The 
  Committee of Fifteen requested the electricians to allow enough electricity 
  to operate the fire alarm system; they also appointed a committee of three to 
  formulate a solution of the electrical supply problem, and called for a late 
  night meeting to make final decision.</p><p>
  At the same time the conference committee of the Metal Trades, charged with 
  the conduct of the original strike of the shipyard workers, called into conference 
  the three men who been appointed by the electrical workers to handle their part 
  in the strike. At first the committee of electrical workers stood firm for a 
  complete shut-down, but when it was evident that the representatives of the 
  Metal Trades were much opposed, they finally consented to allow exemptions if 
  a committee on exemptions could be installed in the city light plant, with authority 
  to state what parts of the system should be allowed to run.</p><p class="subtitle">
  First Conference with the Mayor</p><p>
  At this point A. E. Miller, chairman of the conference committee, called up 
  Mayor Hanson on the telephone and asked him to join the conference. The mayor 
  came over at once to the Collins building and announced that city light and 
  city water should not be interfered with. He refused to recognize any committee 
  on exemptions, but finally, after a long discussion, consented to meet with 
  such a committee and take up with them, section by section, the various parts 
  of the lighting system, in an effort to prove to them that no part of the system 
  should be shut down. A committee of three went over to the mayor&#8217;s office, 
  but a deadlock occurred at once on the question of street lighting, which the 
  committee of three refused to allow.</p><p>
  Upon this the Engineer&#8217;s Union announced to the mayor that if the electricians 
  left they would operate enough of the plant to supply hospitals and other public 
  needs. </p><p class="subtitle">
  Midnight Meeting With Mayor</p><p>
  All the various pieces of consultation and planning on the subject of city light, 
  which had started spontaneously in different quarters as soon a the Green interview 
  appeared in the paper, came to a head in the midnight session of the Committee 
  of Fifteen, called the night before the strike at the Labor Temple. The subject 
  under consideration had been recognized all day as the most serious problem 
  which had yet arisen, involving questions of relations with the city government, 
  as well as the relations between individual unions and the general strike committee. 
  In addition to the Committee of Fifteen, representatives of the electrical workers, 
  the engineers and the conference committee of the Metal Trades were present.</p><p>
  The mayor, invited at a late hour by telephone, appeared shortly after midnight, 
  and reiterated his statement that city water and city light must run. He said 
  that he would prefer to run them with the union men, but that he would run them 
  with soldiers from Camp Lewis or Bremerton if necessary. He added that he did 
  not care about the other public utilities. The car line was not essential; in 
  fact, he might even have the men given a lay-off so that they would not lose 
  their civil service rating. But light and water, he stated, were needed for 
  public health and public peace.</p><p>
  The mayor finally left at 3:30, and the Committee of Fifteen voted, after his 
  withdrawal, to order the electricians back to run the city light plant, with 
  the exception of the commercial service. A committee was appointed to announce 
  this decision to the mayor, who, when called on the telephone, said he would 
  be in his office at 8:30 in the morning.</p><p>
  In the end the city light plant ran without interruption, as far as was apparent 
  to the citizens of Seattle. A month after the strike a member of the strike 
  committee of the electrical workers, when asked how this happened, made the 
  following statement: &#8220;The matter of city light was a bluff between Green 
  and Hanson. We had the operators in the sub station only partially organized 
  and could not have called them off if we had wanted to. We could and did call 
  out the line men and meter men, who responded. But their absence made little 
  immediate difference, and they went back before the strike was called off.</p><p>
  The engineers were in a better position than we to close down city light, but 
  this they declined to do, and only called off their men after it was sure that 
  the city light could run anyway.&#8221;</p><p>
  It was perhaps a rather inglorious explanation of a matter which caused so vital 
  a stir. But, however much bluffing entered into it, a few facts stand out as 
  interesting. First, that the executive committee of the strike, believing that 
  it had the power to shut down city light, ordered that all city lights should 
  run except the commercial power. This is important because it shows the temper 
  of mind in the executive committee. Second, that up to the time when the strike 
  was actually in full swing, Mayor Hanson was not the &#8220;revolution quelling 
  strong man&#8221; that he has been announced as since, but a worried and busy 
  mayor, not sufficiently familiar with the details of his light plant to call 
  Green&#8217;s bluff and endeavoring for many hours in midnight session to argue 
  the strike committee into saving city light from serious inconvenience. It is 
  perhaps not so thrilling a picture, but it is a more human one.</p><p>
  ON THURSDAY AT 10A.M.</p><p>
  The strike had been called for Thursday at 10 a.m. At that hour the street cars 
  began to pull for the barns, the workers all over the town left their tasks, 
  and the strike was on. Some crafts had stopped before the hour set. The cooks 
  had been on strike all the morning, and were working hard preparing food for 
  the strikers&#8217; kitchens.</p><p>
  According to the business press of the city, Seattle was &#8220;prostrate. According 
  to an admission in the morning paper, &#8220;not a wheel turned in any of the 
  industries employing organized labor or in many others which did not employ 
  organized labor.&#8221;</p><p>
  Regular A.F. of L. Strike<br>
  Some 60,000 men were out on strike. The strike was called, organized and carried 
  through by the regular unions of the American Federation of Labor, acting regularly 
  by votes of the rank and file. It was a strike in the calling and conduct of 
  which, contrary to statements made widely throughout the country, no I.W.W. 
  had any part.</p><p>
  Yet the strike affected more organizations than those in the American Federation 
  of Labor. Organizations of the I.W.W. also struck at once, and sent word that 
  if any of their members proved unruly, they themselves would put them out of 
  town and keep them out; as they intended to show the A. F. of L. that they could 
  co operate in a strike without causing disorder. Since no disorder of any kind 
  occurred in Seattle in connection with the strike, it will be seen that they 
  were as good as their word.</p><p class="subtitle">
  Japanese Strike</p><p>
  Among the other organizations striking were the Japanese barbers and restaurant 
  workers. In fact, all the Japanese section of the city was closed up tight and 
  remained closed. The response of the Japanese workers added greatly to the good 
  feeling between them and the American workers, and they were invited to send 
  delegates to the general strike committee, but without vote.</p><p>
  As has been said, the strike was from the beginning to the end under the firm 
  control of duty elected representatives of regular AFL unions, and any other 
  organizations which had also struck had no voice or vote in its conduct. </p><p class="subtitle">
  Many Individual Strikers</p><p>
  How many individuals, unconnected with any organizations, struck just out of 
  a feeling of fellowship for labor will never be known. But there were many of 
  them. In the nature of the case, word is only heard of a few, an elevator boy 
  in an office building of conservative business men, two laborers working for 
  a landscape gardener, and hundreds of other sporadic cases of this type occurred. 
  Persons of this kind had not even a union to protect them in securing their 
  jobs again, yet they struck out of a feeling of sympathy, and a desire to be 
  &#8220;a part of the general strike of Seattle&#8217;s labor movement.&#8221; 
  </p><p class="subtitle">
  Second Meeting of General Strike Committee</p><p>
  Two hours after the strike began the general strike committee held its second 
  full meeting, Thursday at noon. An avalanche of business descended upon it. 
  For three and a half days the Executive Committee of Fifteen had been the authority 
  in strike matters. Now at last the strike was on and the general committee met 
  to survey its handiwork. The greater part of the first session was devoted to 
  attempting to unwind the tangles of the city light situation, which is elsewhere 
  described.</p><p class="subtitle">
  Exemptions Referred to Executive Committee</p><p>
  The regular grist of request for exemptions began to the general committee to 
  come in to the general committee, but was soon found to be too burdensome for 
  so large a body to deal with. It was finally directed that all exemptions should 
  go first to the Committee of Fifteen.</p><p>
  A few typical instances of the type of exemption asked for from the general 
  strike committee are as follows:</p><p>
  Seattle Renton Southern asks permission for transportation in carrying mail. 
  All motions made on this were tabled. Co-operative Market says that the milk 
  supply is short, and the farmers have offered to deliver it if permission is 
  granted. This was referred to the joint council of teamsters. The longshoremen 
  ask permission to handle government mails, customs and baggage. Permission is 
  given for the mails and customs. The postal clerks ask that enough taxi company&#8217;s 
  cars be exempted to give them transportation over the city. This was refused. 
  The icemen ask for exemption in transporting ice to hospitals and drug stores. 
  This was referred to the joint council of teamsters.</p><p>
  Meanwhile words of greeting and help came from nearby towns. Tacoma had called 
  her strike at the same time as Seattle. Various unions in Renton also struck. 
  Everett sent a d to state that if any work was sent to Everett from Seattle, 
  they would call out their men. The mine workers from Taylor offered financial 
  assistance.</p><p>
  The Renton mine workers, being affiliated with the Seattle Central Labor Council, 
  struck. Other organizations of mine workers sent good wishes and the statement 
  that they stood ready to strike if the movement was made statewide.</p><p>
  Meanwhile the Committee of Fifteen had been called upon for additional minor 
  exemptions. They granted permission to the street car men to appoint six of 
  their watchmen for the car barns. They gave permits to the plumbers and steamfitters 
  for seven men to act in emergencies only under the direction of the Plumbers&#8217; 
  Union. These details are of particular interest in showing the closeness with 
  which the city was tied up, and the inevitable result in placing power in the 
  hands of the strike committee over many aspects of the city&#8217;s life.</p><p>
  I. W. W. Cards Recognized for Meals</p><p>
  On Friday morning a new issue came before the general strike committee. A committee 
  from the Transport Workers, an I.W.W. organization, appeared to protest because 
  their &#8220;red cards&#8221; were not recognized at the strikers&#8217; commissaries. 
  At these eating houses the general public paid 35 cents, while men with union 
  cards were admitted for 25 cents. The general strike committee voted that all 
  union cards, regardless of affiliation, should be recognized in the eating places.</p><p>
  This instance of a tendency to cut across the barriers that existed before the 
  strike also came out in discussion concerning the Japanese workers, who had 
  struck in unison with the Americans. After much discussion between those who 
  wished to offer the Japanese full representation on the general strike committee 
  and those who wished only to send a committee to confer with them, it was finally 
  decided to invite them to have seats in the general strike committee, but without 
  vote.</p><p class="subtitle">
  The Mayor Makes Demands</p><p>
  Twenty-four hours after the strike began came the pre-emptory demand of the 
  mayor that the strike be called off. It was perhaps the very completeness and 
  success of the strike, together with the alarm of the business men that brought 
  him to take this aggressive attitude.</p><p>
  At all events, Mayor Hanson, who 36 hours before had spent long hours conferring 
  with the Committee of Fifteen regarding the city light, suddenly adopted a different 
  position. He issued a proclamation to the people announcing that he had plenty 
  of soldiers to maintain order; he sent word out by the United Press throughout 
  the country that he was putting down an attempted Bolshevik revolution. And 
  he sent word to the general strike committee that he wished at once to see their 
  representatives.&#8217;</p><p>
  To these represent he declared that unless the strike was at once called off 
  he would reopen all industries, using soldiers and declaring martial law if 
  necessary. The time first fixed by the Mayor was Friday at noon, but as it was 
  noon before his communication finally reached the general strike committee he 
  deferred the hour till 8 o&#8217;clock Saturday morning.</p><p>
  Already there were members of the committee who had been from the beginning 
  in favor of a limited strike. But, according to the statements of committee 
  members, this action of the mayor&#8217;s solidified resistance. This view of 
  the mayor&#8217;s intrusion was given by Ben Nauman the following Wednesday 
  at the Central Labor Council:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> &#8220;Ole attempted to call the strike off at noon of Friday, and said 
    that if we didn&#8217;t do it he&#8217;d declare martial law. Then he said 
    that unless we declared the strike off Saturday morning he&#8217;d declare 
    martial law. We didn&#8217;t declare it off, and Ole didn&#8217;t declare 
    martial law. Finally, he made many of the members of the committee so mad 
    we couldn&#8217;t declare it off ourselves.&#8221;</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="subtitle">THE STRIKE CALLED OFF</p><p>
  The picture of the calling off of the strike given by Mayor Hanson to the press 
  of the country was dramatic enough. It is significant that it was not printed 
  in the press of Seattle; it was not for &#8220;home consumption.&#8221;</p><p>
  According to the accounts that went around the country, &#8220;the Central Labor 
  Council, which is composed of the heads of the various unions, is controlled 
  by the radicals. Labor tried to run everything.</p><p>
  &#8220;We refused to ask exemptions from any one. The seat of government is 
  at the City Hall. We organized 1,000 extra police, armed with rifles and shotguns, 
  and told them to shoot on sight anyone causing disorder. We got ready for business. 
  &#8220;I issued a proclamation that all life and property would be protected; 
  that all business should go on as usual. And this morning our municipal street 
  cars, light, power plants, water, etc., were running full blast. &#8220;There 
  was an attempted revolution. It neyer got to first base.&#8221;</p><p class="subtitle">
  Lost His Head</p><p>
  This was the account of the Seattle strike sent out by the mayor of Seattle. 
  Later, the president of the Port of Seattle said of Mayor Hanson, in a speech 
  in Washington: &#8220;He is a pretty good fellow, and a mighty good advertiser. 
  But he lost his head completely. He spent $50,000 of the taxpayers&#8217; money 
  for extra policemen which were never needed. Tacoma spent no money and Tacoma 
  had no trouble.&#8221;</p><p class="subtitle">
  How the Mayor Shifted His Ground</p><p>
  It was not until the second day of the strike that Mayor Hanson under the pressure 
  of business men finally took sides against the strikers. Two days before the 
  strike he took James Duncan, secretary of the Central Labor Council, and Charles 
  Doyle, its business agent, out to lunch at Rippe&#8217;s Cafe, paid for the 
  dinner, and talked over the coming strike in a most friendly manner.</p><p>
  &#8220;Now boys,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I want my streetlights and my water, 
  and the hospitals. That&#8217;s all. I don&#8217;t care about the car line or 
  the other departments.&#8221; Perhaps it was the very completeness of the strike, 
  or perhaps the pressure from meetings of business men. Or perhaps the tilt with 
  Green over city light had angered and unnerved him. At any event, on Friday 
  morning he issued a proclamation to the citizens, announcing that he had 1500 
  policemen and 1500 soldiers and calling upon the citizens to go about their 
  business as usual.</p><p>
  He also called up James Duncan and said that the strike must close by noon. 
  When Mr. Duncan replied that this was impossible, he asked that the Executive 
  Committee of the Strike should come to his office at once. He was told that 
  this message would be transmitted but that the committee was very busy and might 
  be unable to come as a body.</p><p>
  The Executive Committee sent a sub-committee of six members to confer with the 
  mayor. The mayor urged them to call off the strike, saying that if the matter 
  could be settled locally they had won &#8220;hands down,&#8221; but that Mr. 
  Piez must be seen, and that &#8220;that group&#8221; had already double-crossed 
  the city and were probably double-crossing the shipyard workers. He offered 
  that if the strike were at once called off, to &#8220;lock up his desk and go 
  to Washington with them, to try to get the wages of the lower paid men raised,&#8221; 
  a demand which he declared to be just.</p><p>
  In case the strike was not called off, he threatened martial law. The committee 
  replied that they were not afraid of martial law, and if that was the mayor&#8217;s 
  next card, they had still other cards themselves. The gas workers had n been 
  ordered out, and the mine workers of the state were ready to go out.</p><p>
  &#8220;If you want the strike to spread, declare martial law,&#8221; they said. 
  &#8220;And furthermore, you don&#8217;t know how the boys in Camp Lewis will 
  stand on the question of strikebreaking.&#8221;</p><p>
  &#8220;By G-, said the mayor, &#8220;if they are not loyal I want to know it.&#8221;</p><p>
  &#8220;If you want to see the streets of Seattle run with blood to satisfy your 
  curiosity about loyalty, we don&#8217;t&#8221; replied Mr. Duncan.</p><p>
  The committee suggested that if they could meet with representatives of the 
  Conciliation Board, the latter might be able to present some offer that they 
  could make to the men as a reason for going back. Consequently the mayor called 
  J. W. Spangler, a banker, and Rev. M. A. Matthews, down to the office, as representing 
  a group of business and civic organizations.</p><p>
  Mr. Spangler said that he must report to &#8220;his people;&#8221; a further 
  conference was then set for 8 o&#8217;clock in the evening.</p><p class="subtitle">
  Tone Seems Changed</p><p>
  When Mr. Spangler returned that evening, his tone had changed. Whereas in the 
  afternoon he had called the labor men by their first names, he was now very 
  short, stating that &#8220;his people&#8221; took the stand that this was a 
  revolution and they would not deal with revolutionists. He admitted that he 
  himself was &#8220;not fooled&#8221; and did not consider it a revolution, but 
  that &#8220;his people&#8221; did; and that they refused to dicker in any way 
  until the strike was called off.</p><p>
  &#8220;That&#8217;s final, is it, Spangler?&#8221; said Hanson, and on being 
  told that it was he said to the Strikers committee: &#8220;Then that&#8217;s 
  all there is to it, boys.&#8221;</p><p>
  From this time on the mayor definitely sided against the strikers. He threatened 
  martial law; he issued his statement to the press of the country branding the 
  strike a revolution. The interpretation of his action given by the strikers 
  since that time has been that he tried, like a good politician, to play both 
  sides, but when it became necessary to choose, he sided with the business group. 
  After the strike was over, when employees of the city were being penalized for 
  having taken part in it, and when officials of the Central Labor Council went 
  to the mayor to intercede men, he remarked:</p><blockquote><p>
  &#8220;You think we couldn&#8217;t run an open shop town here if we wanted to,&#8221; 
  clearly indicating that he had dropped his attitude of conciliation toward the 
  Seattle labor movement for one of hostility.</p></blockquote><p class="subtitle">
  The Fateful Saturday Morning</p><p>
  Many striking inaccuracies occur in the announcement made to the press of the 
  country by Mayor Hanson. &#8220;We refused to ask exemptions from anyone&#8221; 
  he proclaimed. The fact was that he had been conferring regarding exemptions 
  for several days.</p><p>
  &#8220;I issued a proclamation and this morning all our municipal street cars, 
  light, power plant, water, etc., were running full blast.&#8221; The only effect 
  of the mayor&#8217;s proclamation was that seven cars began to run On the Municipal 
  car line.</p><p>
  The water, power and lights had been running from the beginning. On Saturday 
  morning, the time when the mayor called upon business to resume under his protection, 
  business simply did not resume.</p><p>
  The main car lines of the city were not running. A picture taken of Second and 
  Pike streets, one of the busiest corners of the city, at 9 o&#8217;clock on 
  Saturday morning, shows a deserted city. Teamsters, trucks and autos were absent. 
  The restaurants were closed. </p><p class="subtitle">
  What Did Stop the Strike?</p><p>
  What did stop the strike, then, if the mayor&#8217;s proclamation had so little 
  effect? Pressure from international officers of unions, from executive committees 
  of unions, from the &#8220;leaders&#8221; in the labor movement, even from those 
  very leaders who are still called &#8220;Bolsheviki&#8221; by the undiscriminating 
  press and, added to all these, the pressure upon the workers themselves, not 
  of the loss of their own jobs, but of living in a city so tightly closed.</p><p>
  Saturday morning at 8 o&#8217;clock, the hour specified by the mayor for the 
  reopening of industry, saw the General Strike still in full swing. The strike 
  committees were still discussing exemptions, and sending delegates to other 
  cities to explain the strike and ask for support.</p><p>
  But the Executive Committee of Fifteen was seriously considering a resolution 
  for calling off the strike. It was realized that in some form or other the city 
  would have to resume some activity soon. On Saturday afternoon this committee 
  brought in to the General Strike Committee resolution fixing Saturday night 
  as the close of the strike. This had been passed by a vote of 13 to I in the 
  Executive Committee, one member being absent and one voting against it.</p><p>
  The resolution follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> WHEREAS; the unparalleled autocratic attitude of Charles E. Piez, General 
    Manager of the Emergency Fleet Corporation, in refusing to permit the shipyard 
    ?! and employees of this community to enter into a mutually sati agreement 
    as to wag and working conditions (which would not add to the government cost 
    one penny) so aroused the indignation of all unionists in Seattle as to cause 
    them to express that indignation through the medium of a general strike; and</p>
  <p> WHEREAS; it has been recognized that the objectives of such a strike would 
    be extremely limited and consequently no good could be accomplished by continuing 
    such a strike indefinitely; and</p>
  <p> WHEREAS; on the 7th day of February, 1919, the Executive Strike Committee 
    was in session deliberating upon the advisability of calling off said strike 
    on the ground that its object had been fully attained through the unprecedented 
    demonstration of solidarity and the encouragement to the workers in other 
    ship building centers to further co-operate; and</p>
  <p> WHEREAS; the ill-advised, hysterical and inexcusable proclamation of Mayor 
    Ole Hanson tremendously embarrassed the committee in carrying out its plans, 
    by reason of the fact that it suggested coercion; and WHEREAS; martial law 
    having been suggested and threats made to throw the military forces of this 
    nation in the balance on the side of the employing interests; and</p>
  <p> WHEREAS; thirty thousand shipyard workers have been on strike for a period 
    of sixteen days, and sixty-five-thousand workers have been on strike for a 
    period of three days without so much as a fist fight or any other minor disturbance; 
    now, therefore be it</p>
  <p> RESOLVED; that we recommend that the Executive Committee for the general 
    strike, recommend that the general strike, excepting the shipyard workers, 
    be called off at 12 midnight, Saturday, February 8, with the understanding 
    that all persons, who went on strike return to their former positions, holding 
    themselves in readiness to respond to another call from the General Strike 
    Committee in case of failure to secure a satisfactory agreement of the Metal 
    Trades&#8217; demands within a reasonable length of time; and, be it further</p>
  <p> RESOLVED; that Organized Labor of this community express to the Mayor, anti 
    all others, its deep regret at the action taken, and announce as law abiding 
    citizens they have no fear of martial law or any other acts of intimidation 
    used by those pr to represent the public, but who in reality are representing 
    anyone class; and further be it</p>
  <p> RESOLVED; that we take this opportunity of expressing to the strikers our 
    deep appreciation and admiration for the splendid spirit and order maintained 
    under the most trying and aggravating circumstances.</p>
</blockquote>
<p class="subtitle">
  Not Yet Ready to Quit</p><p>
  All afternoon and all night the discussion raged in the General Strike Committee. 
  Many of the most prominent men of the labor movement, including the persons 
  who have since been denounced by Mayor Hanson as &#8220;leaders of revolution&#8221; 
  argued most strongly in favor of ending the Strike.</p><p>
  In spite of their arguments, however, after a discussion which lasted until 
  4:12 in the morning, the voting of the General Strike Committee showed such 
  an overwhelming defeat of the resolution that it was unanimously decided to 
  continue the strike. It was obvious that the Executive Committee of Fifteen 
  and the old-timers in the labor movement were more cautious than the larger 
  committee just elected from the rank and file.</p><p>
  But the break had already begun to appear. Whether the recommendation of the 
  Committee of Fifteen was merely a wise forecast of what was about to happen, 
  or whether their action and the uncertainty about the closing of the strike 
  gave encouragement to the thought of returning, by Monday morning, when the 
  General Strike Committee again met, several unions had gone back to work, under 
  orders from international officers or from their own executive committees, in 
  many cases hastily called and without full attendance. In no case is it recorded 
  that this return was taken by the rank and file.</p><p>
  Most important of these unions were the Street Car Men and the Teamsters. The 
  former reported that they had returned by order of their Executive Committee 
  on recommendation of an international officer, but that they would come out 
  again if called by the General Strike Committee.</p><p>
  The Teamsters had also returned on recommendation of the joint Council of Teamsters, 
  but the rank and file had called another meeting for Monday afternoon at which 
  it was predicted that they would go out on strike again.</p><p>
  An incident in connection with the return of the Teamsters to work is enlightening, 
  as it shows what results may happen through a minor personal friction. On Sunday 
  evening Auditor Briggs, international officer of the Teamsters&#8217; Union, 
  appeared before the Committee of</p><p>
  Fifteen and stated that he had tried to gain the floor both in the Central Labor 
  Council and at the General Strike Committee and had been denied admission. He 
  stated that it was as a result of this attitude toward him (an A.F. of L. representative 
  and international officer) by the persons responsible for the strike that he 
  had ordered the teamsters back, and that he might have acted differently if 
  he had been treated by these bodies as the Committee of Fifteen had treated 
  him.</p><p class="subtitle">
  Roll Call on Monday Shows Some Missing</p><p>
  A few other scattering unions were found missing from their places when the 
  General Strike Committee met on Monday morning. The Barbers had gone back, instructed 
  thereto by a meeting of their Executive Committee.</p><p>
  At this meeting a member of the Lady Barbers was also present, arriving late, 
  and through this fact some confusion arose, a few of the Lady Barbers going 
  back to work without the knowledge of their officers. The majority, however, 
  led by their own Executive Committee, remained out.</p><p>
  As a matter of fact all the women&#8217;s unions showed a strong feeling f loyalty 
  toward the strike, many of them outlasting the men of the same craft.</p><p>
  The Stereotypers were also back at work, reporting that they had been under 
  severe pressure from their international officers, but had only gone back on 
  the report made to them on Saturday night, that the strike was being called 
  off.</p><p>
  The Auto Drivers, Bill Posters, Ice Cream Drivers, and Milk Drivers were not 
  present and were reported as having returned to work. Some of these Organizations 
  belonged to the Joint Council of Teamsters and were included in the general 
  order that was issued by that body.</p><p>
  It was reported that the newsboys had been ordered back by a small meeting of 
  their Executive Committee, at which not even a quorum was present, but that 
  they were holding a general union meeting that evening to settle the question. 
  All other unions were still out on strike and many of them voted enthusiastically 
  to remain &#8220;to the last ditch.&#8221;</p><p>
  A few unions, while sticking to the strike, reported that it might involve them 
  in great hardship. The Sailors&#8217; Un1or for instance, felt that by striking 
  they were placing the Seaman in jeopardy. The Hotel Maids stated that, since 
  they were a small&#8217; union with much competition from non-union girls, they 
  stood to lose their jobs.</p><p>
  At the end of the Monday morning session the Executive Committee of fifteen 
  again submitted a revised resolution, calling for all unions which had returned 
  to work to go out on strike again, in order that all might return in a body 
  the following day, Tuesday at noon. The resolution was passed almost at once 
  by the General Strike Committee. The voting was confined to the &#8220;allies&#8221; 
  or sympathetic strikers, the shipyard workers not being granted a voice.</p><p>
  The text of the resolution was as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p> WHEREAS, this strike committee now assembles in the midst of the general 
    understanding of the true status of the general strike; and</p><p>
    WHEREAS, the Executive Committee is sufficiently satisfied that regardless 
    of the ultimate action that the rank and file would take, the said committee 
    is convinced that the rank and file did stand pat, and the stampede to return 
    to work was not on the part of the rank and file, but rather on the part of 
    their leaders.</p>
  <p> (However, be it understood that this committee does not question the honesty 
    of any of the representatives of the general movement.) Therefore, be it</p>
  <p> RESOLVED, that the following action become effective at once, February 10, 
    1919:</p>
  <p> That this strike committee advise all affiliated unions that have taken 
    action to return their men to work, that said unions shall again call their 
    men to respond immediately to the call of the rank and file until 12 noon 
    February 11, 1919, and to then call this strike at a successful termination, 
    and if developments should then make it necessary that the strike be continued, 
    that further action should be referred to the rank and file exclusively. In 
    the evening the Teamsters reported that a meeting of the rank and file had 
    unanimously voted to strike, again till Tuesday noon in accordance with the 
    recommendation of the General Strike Committee.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  It was generally expected that the Street Car men would also strike again, since 
  they had reported on Sunday to the Committee of Fifteen that their Executive 
  Committee had full power to call them out again, if it seemed needed in the 
  interests of solidarity, and since they had reported on Monday to the General 
  Strike Committee that they would go out again if called to do so by the General 
  Strike Committee. It took, however, some hours to summon a meeting of the Street 
  Car Men&#8217;s Executive Committee, who were at work; and when they were called 
  together, they stated that a meeting of the men to decide on the matter could 
  not be held in time. Consequently the street car men did not come out again.</p><p>
  The meeting of Newsboys took a vote and decided to remain on strike till Tuesday 
  noon. So also did the meeting of Auto Drivers.</p><p>
  It will be noticed that all cases in which the unions voted on the question 
  were decided in favor of the request of the General Strike Committee, while 
  all in which the Executive Committees or the International officers took action, 
  were decided against the General Strike Committee.</p><p>
  This fact was apparent from the beginning of the strike to its close that it 
  was not a strike engineered by leaders, but one voted for, carried on, and kept 
  up by that part of the rank and file that attends union meetings or takes part 
  in referendum votes. The influence of recognized &#8220;leaders&#8221; was in 
  every case on the side of greater caution and conservatism than was actually 
  displayed.</p><p class="subtitle">
  CONSTRUCTIVE ACTIVITIES OF STRIKE: FEEDING THE PEOPLE</p><p>
  Among the pieces of constructive organization carried on during the general 
  strike was the supplying of milk to babies by the milk wagon drivers&#8217; 
  union, the handling of hospital laundry by joint agreement between the laundry 
  drivers, laundry workers, and laundry men; the feeding of strikers and many 
  of the general public by the provision trades, and the maintaining of public 
  peace by the Labor War Veteran Guard.</p><p class="subtitle">
  Milk Stations for Babies</p><p>
  The arrangements made by the laundry drivers and laundry workers for handling 
  hospital laundry are related elsewhere. The milk wagon drivers at first attempted 
  to make a similar type of agreement with the milk dealers or dairy owners. They 
  worked out a plan for neighborhood milk stations all over the city, and for 
  downtown depot stations from which delivery might be made to hospitals.</p><p>
  This plan was submitted to the employers. It was soon felt by the union that 
  the employers were attempting to direct the operation of the plan in such a 
  way as to gain credit themselves in relieving the milk situation of the city. 
  Furthermore, the plan of the employers involved opening of downtown dairies 
  only, which the union believed would leave thousand babies, and especially of 
  th classes, unable to get milk.</p><p>
  The milk wagon drivers&#8217; union therefore withdrew from the attempt to work 
  together with the employers and established through their own organization 35 
  neighborhood milk stations all over the city. The employers meantime combined 
  together and operated one pasteurizing plant at which they themselves did the 
  work, and from which they distributed milk to the various dairies in the city. 
  For this distribution they applied for exemption of one truck, and the milk 
  wagon drivers&#8217; union endorsed their request to the general strike committee. 
  The hospitals were required to come to these dairies for their supply of milk.</p><p class="subtitle">
  Arranged all Over Town</p><p>
  The dairies thus supplied by the milk dealers were only eleven in number, so 
  located that it would have been impossible for the mothers of Seattle to secure 
  milk unless they owned automobiles. The milk Wagon drivers therefore chose 35 
  locations properly spaced throughout the city, secured the use of space in stores, 
  and proceeded to set up neighborhood milk stations.</p><p>
  The stations were announced as open from 9 to 2, but the milk was always gone 
  before noon. The amount handled increased as the days went on until about 3,000 
  gallons were handled in the various stations. The first day the supply ran noticeably 
  short, especially in some parts of town, but by the third day of the strike 
  the irregularities were ironed out and the supply was more adjusted to the need.</p><p>
  The milk was brought into town by the small private dairymen, whose dairies 
  were near the city and had consequently been thoroughly inspected by the board 
  of health, it was raw milk, pure, and authorized for babies. Each dairyman was 
  given the address of a different milk station and made his deliveries direct. 
  The over-supply at some and the under-supply at others was changed the second 
  day by a small amount of delivery handled by the milk drivers&#8217; union between 
  stations.</p><p clsas="subtitle">
  Union Loses Money</p><p>
  The men at the stations gave their services free, and as a result the union 
  stood to make a small profit on their activities in spite of the loss in efficiency 
  which always occurs when a new system is put into effect.</p><p>
  But this gain was more than offset by heavy losses in connection with the supply 
  of milk to the strikers&#8217; eating places. The estimate of the number of 
  people who would have to be fed was much heavier than the number of those who 
  actually came, some 3,000 gallons of milk ordered for these kitchens was never 
  required, and as the milk drivers&#8217; union had contacted for this with the 
  farmers they stood the loss. The milk came from farms and could not have been 
  transferred to the milk stations, because it was un-inspected and not usable 
  for babies. A loss of $700 was therefore sustained by the milk wagon drivers&#8217; 
  union as part of their contribution toward m an emergency in the city of Seattle.</p><p>
  The union has, however, gained in an understanding of the milk problems of a 
  large city, and in ability to do the teamwork of co operation whenever, in the 
  inevitable development of industry, t is seen desirable to handle the milk of 
  the city as a co-operative unit.</p><p class="subtitle">
  Feeding the Strikers</p><p>
  The heaviest and most complicated job of organization fell to the provision 
  trades, charged with feeding the strikers and such members of the general public 
  as desired to patronize the strikers&#8217; commissaries.</p><p>
  The restaurants of Seattle are almost 100 per cent organized. When the vote 
  of the cooks and assistants, the waiters and waitresses threatened to close 
  them down the restaurant owners took the matter philosophically. Many of them 
  offered their kitchens to the cooks for the preparation of food for the strikers 
  and some offered their entire establishments to the unions for the duration 
  of the strike.</p><p>
  It was realized that the feeding of people through a few large restaurants would 
  be much simpler and less expensive than feeding them in specially arranged halls. 
  But for various reasons the offer of the restaurant owners was refused. Chief 
  among the reasons was the fact that to take a few restaurants and omit others 
  would be unfair to the owners who were omitted.</p><p>
  One restaurant owner said to the union: &#8220;Sure, take my whole place and 
  run it. When you boys get through I&#8217;ll have some business.&#8221; The 
  truth behind this remark made it impractical to take some restaurants and leave 
  others. In a few of the outlying districts, where it could be done without discrimination, 
  an occasional restaurant was taken over in its entirety for the duration of 
  the strike, with the cons of the owners.</p><p class="subtitle">
  Open Twenty-one Eating Places</p><p>
  Some 21 eating places were opened in various parts of the city. The food was 
  cooked in large kitchens, the use of which was donated by various restaurants, 
  and was then transported to various halls where it was served, cafeteria style. 
  The original plan called for each person to bring his own &#8220;eating utensils, 
  but this caused so much dissatisfaction that large quantities of paper plates 
  and pasteboard cups were bought, together with small quantities of dishes, tin 
  cups, knives, forks, and spoons.</p><p>
  The trials of the commissary department were many. It had to organize the supply 
  of a large but quite unknown number of meals. It faced difficulties in securing 
  provisions, in transporting cooked materials, in bringing the volunteer cooks 
  to and from their homes. Each of these problems depended on the working together 
  of people who had not had time to become welded into a complete organization.</p><p>
  Delay was experienced on the opening day from many causes. Some of the kitchens 
  promised were withdrawn at the last moment, and the cooks and provisions sent 
  there had to be taken elsewhere. The arrangements for transporting cooked food 
  from one place to another did not work perfectly. In many places the first meal 
  of the day was not ready until 4 or 5 in the afternoon. When it arrived there 
  was only the smallest possible supply of dishes, and the patrons had not noticed 
  the order that each must bring his own. There was no corps of dishwashers to 
  keep up the meager supply of dishes until the waitresses&#8217; union, assisted 
  by patrons, leaped into the breach and organized this very necessary branch 
  of service.</p><p>
  Many of the strikers had been without food all day, as the restaurants had not 
  been open for breakfast. Consequently on the first day there was a certain amount 
  of inevitable grumbling from hungry men. By the second day, however, the difficulties 
  were much reduced and meals began to appear with regularity.</p><p class="subtitle">
  Zeal and Sacrifice under Difficulties</p><p>
  The amount of zeal and sacrifice of many of the cooks deserves special mention. 
  It was expected that they would be taken to and from their work by the auto 
  drivers&#8217; union, but these arrangements did not always work at first, and 
  men who had labored 12 to 14 hours at the hardest kind of work sometimes found 
  themselves faced with a five mile walk home, and another day on the morrow of 
  the same kind of labor.</p><p>
  Through all these difficulties the commissary committee, consisting of William 
  Hinkley, Bert Royce, William Wilkening, and Harry Nestor, with the special assistance 
  of Fred Leandoys, business agent of the cooks, made persistent headway. They 
  had greatly overestimated the number of people that would need to be fed, for 
  many people stayed at home for one or all meals. In the end they were serving 
  30,000 meals a day with little trouble or friction. It was a task magnitude 
  of which only those can appreciate who have attempted to feed even a thousand 
  people with a completely new organization of personnel and facilities.</p><p>
  There was some confusion as to the price of meals. It was at first reported 
  that union men should pay 25 cents a meal, and the general public 35 cents. 
  Different modifications took place in this order, sometimes without reaching 
  all the eating houses. On the final day the price was 25 cents to everyone.</p><p>
  This covered a full and very substantial meal of beef stew, with large chunks 
  of beef and whole potatoes and carrots, spaghetti with tomato sauce, bread and 
  coffee. On some days the menu was varied by steak, or pot roast and gravy, in 
  place of the stew. It will be seen that the diet chosen was by no means an inexpensive 
  one, especially as every person was allowed as much as he could eat.</p><p class="subtitle">
  Money Loss of Kitchens</p><p>
  After the strike was over and the committee of the Metal Trades who had guaranteed 
  the bifls added up their accounts they found a loss of some $6,000 to $7,000.</p><p>
  Nearly $1,000 worth of bread was left on the last day and had to be given away. 
  Over $1,000 had been spent on equipment, and $1,500 for trucks to haul the food 
  from place to place. In addition to this the first day of the strike showed 
  a loss, for this day alone, of over $5,000, due to the difficulties of getting 
  started and the spoiling of so much food which soured before the next day. Much 
  of this was due to 0 the number of meals that would be necessary, and much of 
  it to the fact that a few hours was not long enough to get the machinery of 
  transportation and operation into running order.</p><p>
  &#8220;If the strike had lasted four or five days more,&#8221; states Bert Swain, 
  secretary of the Metal Trades Council, &#8220;we would have come out even, and 
  after that, reduced the price. Another time there should be some one caterer 
  at the head for the buying of supplies, and some one person in charge of transportation. 
  We did not realize how large a feature of the job the transportation work would 
  be.&#8221;</p><p class="subtitle">
  PRESERVING THE PEACE</p><p>
  It was the universal testimony that never had strike been carried on so peacefully 
  as the Seattle general strike. &#8220;Sixty thousand men out and not even a 
  fistfight&#8221; was the way one labor group expressed it.</p><p>
  The city was far more orderly than under ordinary conditions. The general police 
  courts arrests sank to 32 on the first day of the strike, 18 on the second, 
  and 30 on the Monday morning report for Saturday and Sunday. Not one of these 
  arrests was due in any way to the strike.</p><p>
  Maj. Gen. Morrison, who came over from Camp Lewis in charge of troops, told 
  the strikers&#8217; committee which called upon him that in 40 years of military 
  experience he had not seen so quiet and orderly a city.</p><p class="subtitle">
  Reasons Given for Order</p><p>
  What was the reason for this order? Mayor Hanson says it was secured by his 
  extra police. &#8220;They knew we meant business and they started no trouble&#8221; 
  he declared, in the pronouncement sent broadcast through the country. &#8220;While 
  the business men and the authorities prepared for riots, labor organize for 
  peace.&#8221; Such is the statement of a reporter from a near-by city, who came 
  to get a first-hand view.</p><p>
  Robert Bridges, president of the port of Seattle, wrote a letter to the Central 
  Labor Council in which he declared that &#8220;it was the members&#8217; of 
  organized labor who kept order during the strike. To them and to no one else 
  belongs the credit.</p><p>
  &#8220;It was a great spiritual victory for organized labor,&#8221; he declares, 
  &#8220;a victory that cannot be taken from you not withstanding many assertions 
  that others than yourselves were responsible for preserving that peace and order.&#8221;</p><p>
  He alluded to the show of force and the calling in of the troops as &#8220;an 
  aggravation&#8221; rather than a help, tending to give labor the impression 
  that violence was expected from them. &#8220;Notwithstanding these extraordinary 
  precautions, which were an extreme aggravation to them, the members of organized 
  labor restrained themselves and went about their way quietly and peaceably. 
  I sincerely hope that this will establish a precedent for future strikes.&#8221;</p><p class="subtitle">
  The View of the Business World</p><p>
  There is no doubt that large numbers of business men in Seattle believed the 
  view that has been sent broadcast throughout the nation, that it was the action 
  of Mayor Hanson in bringing in machine guns, increasing the police force by 
  six hundred men, and deputizing some 2,400 citizens of all varieties with the 
  right to carry guns, that stopped a bloody and violent revolution in the Northwest. 
  This is the time honored method of the authorities, and the business world as 
  a class believes in it, and expects machine guns to prevent violence.</p><p class="subtitle">
  Bitterness among Business Men</p><p>
  Bitterness was great in the business world. Some reasons why it was greater 
  among them than among the strikers may be touched upon later; here we will merely 
  quote the statement made to the writer by a prominent public official who was 
  mixing much with both sides:</p><p>
  &#8220;It is only necessary to mix among the business men of this city and then 
  among the strikers, and hear their remarks, or even watch their faces, to find 
  out which ones have murder in their hearts!&#8221;</p><p>
  It was a commonly noticed fact that women on trains running into Seattle, or 
  in clubs, or in gatherings of other kinds, expressed the view that those strikers 
  ought to be stood up against a wall and shot down.&#8221; Two weeks after the 
  strike, a prominent businessman remarked to friends: &#8220;If that strike had 
  lasted a few days longer, there would have been some people hung.&#8221; The 
  expectation, even the desire, to see the streets run with blood, was heard constantly 
  in business offices.</p><p>
  &#8220;I had four hundred requests for guns,&#8221; said one proprietor of a 
  hardware store, &#8220;and not one from a laboring man, as far as I could judge 
  them.&#8221;</p><p>
  Two thousand four hundred citizens, according to the mayor&#8217;s statement, 
  were given authority to use stars and guns. The process by which this authority 
  was secured is thus described by two young men who were deputized:</p><p>
  &#8220;We went into an office and held up our hands and someone mumbled some 
  oath or other and they pinned a star on us and turned us loose.&#8221;</p><p>
  One responsible business man who secured a star in order to &#8220;protect his 
  property&#8221; relates overhearing two &#8220;young kids&#8221; who had just 
  been deputized, and who were openly exulting in the hope of &#8220;potting a 
  striker.&#8221;</p><p class="subtitle">
  Soldiers Brought In</p><p>
  In addition to the armed men thus turned l somewhat irresponsibly in the city&#8217;s 
  streets, soldiers were brought over from Camp Lewis. These were, however, hardly 
  seen at all by the citizens, as they did not appear on the streets in any numbers.</p><p>
  It was fortunate for the city of Seattle that the soldiers came under the charge 
  of a man like Maj. General Morrison. Vested, in the absence of President Wilson 
  from our shores, with the right to declare martial law if he deemed it necessary, 
  he appeared to wish to conduct himself in such a manner as to bring no censure 
  from the president for hasty action. To a committee of strikers who called upon 
  him to ask about the mayor&#8217;s threat of martial law he replied that if 
  any martial law was necessary, he himself would declare it, and it would be 
  no bluff when he declared it.</p><p>
  Two facts deserve comment in connection with the calling in of the Soldiers 
  One is that the high pile of &#8220;literature&#8221; about the strike which 
  had been furnished Maj. Gen. Morrison to give him &#8220;information&#8221; 
  contained not a single page of authentic statement from the strikers.</p><p>
  Denunciations in un-tempered language from small business sheets, together with 
  unauthorized dodgers, some of which seemed to come from the I.W.W., were there 
  in abundance. The whole collection tended to foster a belief in the revolutionary 
  character of the strike but not one single copy of the official announcements 
  published by the strike committees; and not a copy of the Union Record or the 
  strike bulletin, of which over 100,000 had been sent broadcast. The major general 
  did not even know of the existence of the Union Record, the official organ of 
  the Central Labor Council, and the paper which has the largest circulation of 
  any newspaper in the Northwest. Who compiled the collection of &#8220;information&#8221; 
  for him is not known, but its intent was obvious.</p><p>
  A second interesting fact is that when the writer of this history called upon 
  the successor of Maj. Gen. Morrison, to secure information regarding the calling 
  in of the troops such information was not available. The officer in charge stated 
  that he was not authorized to inform the people of Seattle either the number 
  of men sent over, nor at whose request or order they had been sent, nor for 
  what purpose they were in the city, whether to guard government property or 
  to give general aid in case of trouble. It thus appears that military authorities 
  may be quartered in an American city, and the people of that city be denied 
  the right to know at the time or afterward for what purpose or at whose request 
  they have come and what they propose to do.</p><p class="subtitle">
  Labor Organizes for Order</p><p>
  Meanwhile the strikers &#8220;organized for peace and order.&#8221; They realized 
  that they had nothing to gain and everything to lose by a riot in the streets. 
  The tone of the editorial comment in the Strike Bulletin and the Union Record, 
  both before the strike and after,, a marked absence of bitterness and a prevalence 
  of good humor.</p><p>
  &#8220;A machine gun may be a good argument, but it does mighty little execution 
  where there are no crowds&#8221; was one little squib to discourage the forming 
  of large groups in the streets.</p><p>
  &#8220;Wild rumors are floating around. Be careful how you believe them. The 
  worst of these tales yesterday was that the strikers had blown up the city water 
  dam. Whoever started this is responsible for much unnecessary mental anguish. 
  The strikers are not blowing up anything. So runs another of the &#8220;Strike 
  Notes.&#8221;</p><p>
  &#8220;Keep quiet. Let the other fellow do the quarreling,&#8221; was another 
  slogan passed around. The Strike Bulletin commented favorably on the use of 
  public libraries which had increased with a tremendous bound during the strike, 
  and urged small community sings and recreational gatherings for the purpose 
  of &#8220;making the most of your leisure time.&#8221; And it ended: &#8220;This 
  is fine weather for a vacation, anyway.&#8221;</p><p>
  Editorials on &#8220;Keep Smiling&#8221; poked gentle fun at the self-important 
  new youthful deputies who pushed their way through crowds at the Labor Temple, 
  and urged the workers to remember that &#8220;when you were 18 you thought you 
  ran the world,&#8221; and not to grow angry at the youths.</p><p class="subtitle">
  Labor&#8217;s War Veterans</p><p>
  In addition to this constant stream of propaganda in the interests of quietness 
  and order, a group of some 300 union men who had seen service in the U. S. army 
  or navy were organized into Labor&#8217;s War Veterans. F. A. Rust, head of 
  the Seattle Labor Temple Association, an old and tried and rather conservative 
  member of organized labor, was at the head.</p><p>
  In an interview with the mayor before the strike, Mr. Rust was told that he 
  could have his men deputized and given police authority if they would come down 
  and be sworn in. He refused this suggestion.</p><p>
  &#8220;We think it will reassure the public to know,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that 
  we have no guns. We know that we can keep order in our own ranks without the 
  use force, if there is any shooting done, it will not be by us.&#8221;</p><p class="subtitle">
  &#8220;We Have No Guns&#8221;</p><p>
  Scrawled across the blackboard at one of the headquarters of the War Veterans 
  Guard ran the words: &#8220;The purpose of this organization is to preserve 
  law and order without the use of force. No volunteer will have any police power 
  or be allowed to carry weapons of any sort, but to use persuasion only. Keep 
  clear of arguments about the strike and discourage others from them.&#8221;</p><p>
  The method of dispersing crowds was thus described by one of the volunteers: 
  &#8220;I would just go in,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and say: &#8216;Brother Workingmen, 
  this is for your own good. We mustn&#8217;t have crowds that can be used as 
  an excuse to start any trouble.&#8217; And they would answer: &#8216;You&#8217;re 
  right, brother,&#8217; and begin to scatter.&#8221;</p><p>
  This was the method used in dispersing the crowd that gathered when the first 
  unsuccessful attempt was made to start the municipal car line, One of the guards 
  reporting on this stated that, &#8220;the regular police didn&#8217;t get in 
  until we had the crowd moving, and then they came over Swinging their sticks 
  and saying &#8216;get out of here.&#8217;</p><p class="subtitle">
  The &#8220;Shooting&#8221; Star</p><p>
  One of the &#8220;aggravations&#8221; mentioned by Mr. Bridges as tending to 
  provoke disturbance, but which failed to cause any trouble because of the methods 
  used by the Labor&#8217;s War Veterans Guard, was the action of the Star, a 
  Scripps paper, which, until the advent of the Union Record, had been the largest 
  paper in the Northwest. Its circulation by the time the strike occurred had 
  been almost cut in two.</p><p>
  With the help of men who worked under the direct order of international officers, 
  the Star published a small issue on the afternoon of the strike, and sent a 
  boy to the Post Office corner to dispose of them. A large and somewhat irritated 
  crowd gathered. A hurry call sent to the headquarters of the Labor Guard brought 
  out several men who succeeded in quietly dispersing the crowd.</p><p>
  Then one of the Labor Guard talked to the boy, explaining what scabbing meant. 
  The youth declared that he would stop if he could get back to the Star office, 
  whereupon the guard hailed a passing automobile belonging to a union man and 
  sent the boy with his papers to the paper that sent him out.</p><p>
  On the following day the Star again printed its paper with a cordon of police 
  drawn up at both ends of the street. The papers were passed out by police and 
  were sent into the residence districts in machines full of armed guards. The 
  strikers made at no time any attempt to interfere. The episode seriously injured 
  what remaining popularity the Star had with the workers of Seattle. It has been 
  alluded to in spontaneous cartoon and comment, as the &#8220;shooting Star.&#8221;</p><p class="subtitle">
  A Permanent Gain </p><p>
  The Labor War Veteran Guard was organized with two headquarters, each with a 
  chairman and secretary in charge for eight hour shifts day and night. The men 
  in charge were in every instance exceptional appearing individuals, the kind 
  one instinctively classes as &#8220;leaders of men.&#8221; The groups acting 
  under them were loyal labor men, most of who could have received from $5 to 
  $6 a day as special police, if they had acted under the police department instead 
  of volunteering their service for labor. But they believed in the &#8220;big 
  idea&#8221; behind the Labor Guard, which one of them expressed thus:</p><p>
  &#8220;Instead of a police force with clubs, we need a department of public 
  safety, whose officers will understand human nature and use brains and not brawn 
  in keeping order. The people want to obey the law, if you explain it to them 
  reasonably.&#8221;</p><p>
  The Labor War Veteran Guard co-operated with the police force and worked without 
  friction with them. How long this would have lasted cannot be estimated, since, 
  of course, the fundamental principles underlying the two groups are dissimilar.</p><p>
  The Labor Guard is to become a permanent organization in Seattle for the purpose 
  of preserving order in labor&#8217;s own ranks, during strikes, parades, public 
  meetings and similar events.</p><p class="subtitle">
  OUR OWN ACTIVITIES</p><p>
  Some misunderstanding, intentional or otherwise, was caused by the interpretation 
  given by the daily press to the editorial in the Union Record which spoke of 
  &#8220;opening up more and more activities under our own management. This was 
  held to presage a violent overturning of government and a seizure by force of 
  property in the city.</p><p>
  As a matter of fact, without disturbance or disorder, more and more activities 
  in Seattle have opened under the management of labor; and the move in this direction 
  seemed to be only a beginning. A month after the strike, when this was written, 
  union after union is talking cooperative stores of various kinds.</p><p>
  These range the simple desire to start the cooperative workshop in which members 
  of the same union hall co-operate to produce--to more elaborate schemes for 
  enlisting groups of unions in starting a department store. The barbers union 
  is talking of a chain of co-operative barber shops. The jewelry workers have 
  already opened a store on the Rochdale plan. The steamfitters and plumbers are 
  carrying on a flourishing grocery business.</p><p>
  The interest in &#8220;our own activities&#8221; has been tremendously stimulated 
  by the strike. Both money for starting movements and money for patronage come 
  easily. The members of organized labor have had the experience of working together 
  and they appear to want more of it.</p><p>
  Some of the unions, like the cooks, milk wagon drivers and laundry Workers, 
  have had the experience during the strike of co-operation on a large scale. 
  These particular organizations are not announcing plans for co-operation at 
  present, as their relations with their employers are satisfactory. But it is 
  evident from the tone of discussion that the rank and file in these organizations 
  feel a new sense of power to organize and manage activities of their own craft 
  or industry. They are ready to use it, when occasion comes.</p><p class="subtitle">
  Cooperative Markets Stimulated</p><p>
  The Cooperative Meat Market grew greatly during the strike. It had three shifts 
  of men working to supply the strikers&#8217; kitchens. On the first Friday in 
  February, during the strike, this concern did a cash business of $6,257, including 
  over $3,000 worth of meat bought by the strikers&#8217; kitchens. The contrast 
  of this with the first Friday in January, when the cash business was $2,126, 
  or with the entire month of January, when the business was $37,000, shows the 
  big gain during the period of the strike.</p><p>
  How much of this gain will be permanent cannot be told. Of course, the strikers&#8217; 
  kitchens are no longer supplied, but the increase over the January sales, even 
  after the strike terminated, is still noticeable. Some of this no doubt would 
  have come through natural expansion, but the strike called attention more quickly.</p><p>
  The Co-operative Grocery, (Rochdale plan) traces its sudden growth not only 
  to the strike, but to a raid conducted on its office a week before the strike, 
  during which the books were seized. Before that time, the business ranged from 
  $250 to $500 a day; but the first Saturday after the raid a record of $1,100 
  was established. During the strike, the business was still nearly three times 
  what it had been before the raid.</p><p>
  Membership in the grocery organization, which involves a $10 entrance fee, also 
  increased 70 per cent during this period. Much interest started in outlying 
  districts, and plans are now discussed for a large number of branch stores.</p><p>
  In Tacoma, the interest in Rochdale stores also reached a climax, resulting 
  in the establishing of three such stores in a p of two weeks. At the same time, 
  the Sheet Metal Workers&#8217; union opened a cooperative shop owned by their 
  organization, and the auto- mechanics laid plans and raised money for an auto 
  repair shop owned by the union, while the painters and decorators are getting 
  a similar project under way.</p><p class="subtitle">
  The Pipe Trades Grocery</p><p>
  One of the most enthusiastic developments of the General Strike was the profitless 
  grocery run by the steamfitters and plumbers. It was started to furnish provisions 
  to strikers at wholesale cost plus the overhead cost of handling. Rent was secured 
  free from the Union Record, striking steamfitters gave their time without charge, 
  and the organization advanced a preliminary $1,500 to buy goods. On the first 
  day the store was crowded with customers and has remained so ever since.</p><p>
  Then the steamfitters went into various unions and sold &#8220;grocery tickets,&#8221; 
  entitling the recipient to $5 worth of groceries. With receipts from these tickets, 
  together with another $1,500 advanced from the organization treasury, and $2,100 
  from the plumbers, they had capital enough to buy out a $15,000 business on 
  a prominent corner.</p><p>
  Already (a month after the strike) they are buying potatoes, eggs, butter, meats 
  and milk direct from the farmers, and expect before long to get flour direct 
  from the co-operative mill. They are doing a business of $1,800 per day. When 
  the strike of the shipyard workers is over and the steamfitters and plumbers 
  go back to work, those who are retained to care for the store will be paid wages. 
  The plan is at present to pay $8 a day to everyone employed from the manager 
  down, this being the wage demanded by their trades.</p><p clsas="subtitle">
  Striking Against Their Own Plants</p><p>
  Undoubtedly the business of the various union-owned activities in Seattle would 
  have received a larger boost, if it had not been for the policy pursued by the 
  strikers of &#8220;striking against their own plants.&#8221; For when the capitalistically 
  controlled industries of Seattle were shut down, no discrimination was shown 
  by the strikers; the union owned activities also took a vacation.</p><p>
  The underlying reasons for this were many. Among them is the fact that the workers, 
  striking as crafts, were naturally in the position of employees, not owners, 
  in each particular union-owned industry. To a janitor, the Labor Temple association 
  was as much of an &#8220;employer of labor&#8221; as was the City-County building.</p><p>
  But the main reason was that the vast majority of the workers, not contemplating 
  revolution, knew that after the strike they would still have to do business 
  in a business world. And the standards of fairness in that world demanded that 
  they should not unfairly favor one of two competing concerns, if they hoped 
  to deal satisfactorily with both of them.</p><p>
  There was even talk of closing down the Cooperative Market, but the need for 
  food prevailed over this idea. However, the Mutual Laundry shut down; the Labor 
  Temple went without janitors, except for volunteers; and the Union Record stopped 
  for a day and a half.</p><p>
  This shut-down caused more protest from the strikers than any other in the closing 
  of industries. The Union Record was &#8220;their paper;&#8221; many of them 
  hoped to see it sweep the others from the streets as the only paper issued. 
  The craving for news, for printed matter of any kind Connected with the strike, 
  became very urgent. It was a need almost greater than that for food.</p><p>
  The plant of the Union Record, under the direction of the Strike Committee with 
  a volunteer force, published for free distribution a &#8220;Strike Bulletin,&#8221; 
  a small two-page sheet without advertisements and with no telegraph news service 
  except such as bore directly on the strike.</p><p>
  On the afternoon when it was given out, streets surrounding the Union Record 
  office were jammed with a crowd of perhaps 5,000 people. Even the efforts of 
  the Labor Guard were insufficient to keep them away. But the Strike Bulletin 
  served only to aggravate the desire for reading matter, and on Saturday, the 
  third day of the strike, after the</p><p>
  Star had disregarded the strike by sending out papers on wagons with armed police, 
  and after the Post-lntelligencer had managed to issue a four-page sheet which 
  was given away at its own doors, the General Strike Committee directed the Union 
  Record to start printing again. At the same time, the General strike Committee 
  assumed full responsibility for the fact that the paper had not been published.</p><p>
  The grounds for closing down the Union Record are given by its editor, E B Ault, 
  and board of directors, as follows &#8220;Since the strike was not revolutionary 
  in intent, the conduct of the official organ of the Central Labor Council was 
  a matter for careful consideration. The printing trades on the other papers 
  had been asked and were expected to strike in concert with all the other trades.</p><p>
  After the purposes of the general strike had been served these men were expected 
  to go back to work in the offices from which they had walked out, and the management 
  of the Union Record felt that it would be unfair business practice to take advantage 
  of their competitors by operating during the strike, and also felt that it would 
  make it much harder for the printing trades to return to their work with continued 
  amicable relations with their employers.</p><p>
  &#8220;Then, too, news is as much a part of public service as transportation, 
  and since transportation was stopped news naturally should have been stopped 
  in order that the community might know what labor solidarity really meant. The 
  needs of the workers could be and were served by the issuance of a strike bulletin 
  carrying all the essential developments of the day.</p><p>
  &#8220;The policy of the management of the paper was explained to the executive 
  committee of the general strike committee and met with the approval of that 
  body. That it was justified has been proved by the fact that the circulation 
  of the paper has increased tremendously since the strike, and by the further 
  fact that the opponents of organized labor have not been able to point to any 
  unfairness on our part in 0 the strike.</p><p class="subtitle">
  THE AFTERMATH</p><p>
  There were no arrests during the strike for any matters connected with the strike. 
  There was, as the strikers liked to remark, &#8220;not even a fist-fight.&#8221;</p><p>
  But no sooner was the strike over than the county authorities sent out and arrested 
  thirty-nine members of the Industrial Workers of the World, on the charge of 
  being &#8220;ring-leaders of anarchy.&#8221; Some of these arrests were accomplished 
  by raiding the IWW headquarters, and then stationing a plain clothes man in 
  the office of the secretary to arrest all members as they came in to pay their 
  dues. Most of the members were soon released, only a few of the more prominent 
  being held.</p><p>
  The Socialist party headquarters was also raided and the Socialist candidate 
  for the city council arrested. The Equity Printing Plant, a co-operative printing 
  establishment, the stock of which is owned by various organization of workers 
  and many industrial workers, was raided, its manager arrested and the plant 
  closed. Later the plant was allowed to reopen, for eight hours daily under the 
  constant surveillance of policemen. The policemen opened the plant in the morning, 
  locked it up at night, and supervised its operation during the day. A marked 
  falling off in business was stated to be the result.</p><p>
  The cause given for all these arrests was the passing out of leaflets during 
  the strike, which were alleged to have been prepared by the IWW or radical Socialists 
  and to have been printed at the Equity Printing Plant. Chief among these was 
  a dodger entitled &#8220;Russia Did It,&#8221; urging the workers to operate 
  their own industries.</p><p>
  The arrested men had no connection with the Central Labor Council or with the 
  General Strike. They claimed, however, that they were arrested because of a 
  desire of the authorities to prosecute someone on account of the strike, and 
  that they, being undefended by any union, were the easiest victims. They asked 
  the central Labor Council to come to their defense.</p><p>
  A committee of the Central Labor Council was appointed to investigate their 
  case, and reported that in its opinion no one of the leaflets on which charges 
  were Passed gave any evidence of anarchy Or desire for violence, but were rather 
  socialistic in their teaching. They alluded especially to the setting of a policeman 
  in the Equity Printing Plant, together with the remark of the chief of police 
  that he did this because &#8220;he got tired of what they were printing&#8221; 
  and his further remark to a protesting committee that if any more committees 
  came to see him he would close down the plant entirely.</p><p>
  Declaring that an &#8220;invasion of fundamental rights had taken place,&#8221; 
  through unlawful raids and arrests, they announced that &#8220;fundamental rights 
  do not go by favor, and when they are denied to one they are denied to all.&#8221;</p><p>
  While expressing their opposition to the IWW as a dual organization, and urging 
  workers everywhere, in the interests of solidarity, to join the regular labor 
  movement, they yet recognized the existence in this case, of &#8220;one common 
  enemy.&#8221;</p><p>
  Their recommendation was adopted by a practically unanimous vote: &#8220;That 
  the Central Labor Council immediately takes up the defense of these men, in 
  order that the fundamental rights involved in these cases which are necessary 
  to our own existence, shall be preserved.&#8221;</p><p>
  There the cases stand at present (March 6) with several workers, presumably 
  members of the I.W.W. arrested on the charge of criminal anarchy in connection 
  with the strike, and the Central Labor Council coming to their defense because 
  &#8220;fundamental rights are involved.</p><p class="subtitle">
  WON OR LOST?</p><p>
  From coast to coast the newspapers declared that the General Strike in Seattle 
  was lost. The Seattle newspapers announced the same fact; the workers were creeping 
  back to work downcast, that they had lost their strike. The press then proceeded 
  to offer them many bits of advice and admonition, chiefly that they must &#8220;clean 
  house&#8221; at once, and get rid of their radical leaders.</p><p>
  But strange to say, except for an occasional note of regret, the workers of 
  Seattle did not go back to work with the feeling that they had been beaten. 
  They went smiling, like men who had gained something worth gaining, like men 
  who had done a big job and done it well. The men went back, feeling that they 
  had won the strike; although as yet there was no sign from Washington that Piez 
  would relent on a single point.</p><p>
  They went back laughing at the suggestion that they &#8220;clean house of their 
  radical leaders who had tried to make a Bolshevik revolution.&#8221; They knew 
  quite well that these same leaders were the men who had counseled caution and 
  moderation, who had urged them to fix a time limit, and had later urged a return 
  before the individual unions should start back, one at a time. They knew that 
  these &#8220;radical leaders&#8221; were really more conservative than the voting 
  rank and file that goes to meetings: and they were amused at the attempts of 
  the press to make them believe otherwise. They had chosen the strike themselves, 
  and it had been a great experience.</p><p>
  Hardly a word of regret was heard from the men who had lost five days&#8217; 
  pay for a cause, It was the men whose business had been hurt, the men who had 
  expected riot and found none, who told them they had &#8220;failed.&#8221;</p><p>
  So it is worth considering for a moment, to what extent was the Seattle General 
  Strike won--or lost?</p><p class="subtitle">
  What Was the Strike For?</p><p>
  What did the workers expect to gain? What were they striking for?</p><p>
  It is easy, once we have had an experience, to analyze the complex motives that 
  went into it. But reasoning and analysis cannot take place before there is an 
  experience to learn from. There had never been a General Strike in this country. 
  None of Seattle&#8217;s workers had ever lived through one. So it is not surprising 
  that we should be able now to see the fact that many varied motives and reasons 
  entered in the Seattle General Strike, and that we had not had the experience 
  at the time to state to ourselves very clearly just what we wanted or expected.</p><p>
  Some were striking to gain a definite wage increase for their brother workers 
  in the shipyards. Some few, a very few, were striking because they thought &#8220;The 
  Revolution&#8221; was about to arrive. But the vast majority were striking &#8220;just 
  for sympathy,&#8221; just as a show of solidarity. The extent to which they 
  were also moved, half- Consciously, by the various forms of labor&#8217;s upheaval 
  going on throughout the world, cannot be estimated, consciously perhaps, not 
  very much; but unconsciously and instinctively, a great deal. Strikes and upheavals 
  were in the air.</p><p>
  For a Definite Gain?<br>
  Those who struck for a definite aim; the raise of the wages in the Shipyard, 
  did not gain their aim. It is true that men were hurrying here from Washington, 
  D.C., to look into matters. It is true that some gain may the end be influenced 
  by the strike. But the sympathetic strikers went back to work with Piez still 
  interfering in the local Situation.</p><p>
  Possibly one of the reasons they did not gain a definite end was that no end 
  was stated quite definitely and simply enough. And perhaps one lesson that other 
  cities may learn from the experience of</p><p>
  Seattle is this: &#8220;If you are striking for a definite aim, and refusing 
  to come back until you have gained it, make your aim so clear and simple that 
  everyone in the city will know the one man on whom to bring pressure, and what 
  one act to demand of him.&#8221;</p><p>
  If the strikers had said: &#8220;We are remaining out until Mr. Piez definitely 
  and publicly states that he will leave Seattle employers and employees alone 
  to bargain together over their own affairs,&#8221;--if they had asked anything 
  so simple as that it is quite possible that the worried business men and the 
  general public of Seattle would have been led to concentrate their annoyance 
  on Mr. Piez until he gave into this definite demand.</p><p>
  But what they were asking--a raise in wages in the shipyards--was not something 
  which either Mr. Piez alone, or the Seattle shipyard owners alone, or the Seattle 
  Chamber of Commerce alone could give them. It was something that demanded joint 
  action by several different people.</p><p>
  And consequently the persons in the community who felt the ill effects of the 
  general strike had no immediate outlet for their grievance. They felt that they 
  were being annoyed and punished for something which was not their fault and 
  about which they had the power to do nothing. This fact undoubtedly accentuated 
  the feeling of bewildered bitterness in the business world. They could see no 
  constructive plan in the strike. They naturally jumped to thoughts of revolution 
  and disorder.</p><p class="subtitle">
  For Revolution?</p><p>
  Those workers, of whom there were probably few, who thought &#8220;the social 
  revolution&#8221; was ready to start in Seattle, were also doomed to disappointment.</p><p>
  Probably hardly any of the so-called &#8220;leaders, accused by the press of 
  trying to start Bolshevism in America, believed that the revolution was at hand. 
  Such belief as there was occurred in isolated cases in the rank and file and 
  was expressed by the disappointed youthful cry of the boy in the Newsboys&#8217; 
  Union: &#8220;I thought we were going to get the industries.&#8221;</p><p>
  The men who had been longer in Seattle&#8217;s labor movement, even those among 
  them who look forward to &#8220;the revolution&#8221; ultimately, were quite 
  certain that it was not coming now. They knew that it was not coming because 
  the majority of Seattle&#8217;s workers did not have the intentions or the past 
  experience on which revolution is built. And yet, while no revolution occurred 
  and none was intended, the workers of Seattle feel themselves, because of their 
  experience, in the position of men who know the steps by which an industrial 
  revolution occurs.</p><p>
  An editorial in the Union Record, two weeks after the strike, discusses the 
  workers&#8217; government just arising in Belfast, and draws comparison with 
  the Seattle general strike. &#8220;They are singularly alike in nature. Quiet 
  mass action, the tying up of industry, the granting of exemptions, until gradually 
  the main activities of the city are being handled by the strike committee.</p><p>
  &#8220;Apparently in all cases there is the same singular lack of violence which 
  we noticed here. The violence comes, not with the shifting of power, but when 
  the &#8216;counter-revolutionaries&#8217; try to regain the power which inevitably 
  and almost without their knowing it passed from their grasp. Violence would 
  have come in Seattle, if it had come, not from the workers, but from attempts 
  by armed opponents of the strike to break down the authority of the strike committee, 
  over its own members. </p><p>
  &#8220;We had no violence in Seattle and no revolution. That fact should prove 
  that neither the strike committee nor the rink and file of the workers ever 
  intended revolution.</p><p>
  &#8220;But our experience, meantime, will help us understand the way in which 
  events are occurring in other communities all over the world, where a general 
  strike, not being called off, slips gradually into the direction of more and 
  more affairs by the strike committee, until the business group, feeling their 
  old prestige slipping, turns suddenly to violence, and there comes the test 
  of force.&#8221;</p><p class="subtitle">
  To Express Solidarity?</p><p>
  We come then to the last of the reasons entering into the general Strike reason 
  which was the simplest and the most important. The vast majority struck to express 
  solidarity. And they succeeded beyond their expectations.</p><p>
  They saw the labor movement come out almost as one man and tie up the industries 
  of the city. They saw the Japanese and the IWW and many individual workers join 
  in the strike, and they responded with a glow of appreciation. They saw garbage 
  wagons and laundry wagon going along the streets marked &#8220;exempt by strike 
  committee.&#8221; &#8216;Hey saw the attention of the whole continent turned 
  on Mr. Piez and the Seattle shipyards. </p><p>
  They learned a great deal more than they expected to learn--more than anyone 
  in Seattle knew before. They learned how a city is taken apart and put together 
  again. They learned what it meant to supply milk to the babies of the city; 
  to feed 30,000 people with a brand-new organization. They came close for the 
  first time in their lives &#8220;to the problems of management.&#8221;</p><p>
  They went back proud of themselves for the way they had come out; proud of themselves 
  for the way they had kept order under provocation: glad to have gained so much 
  education with so little comparative suffering; glad to have worked shoulder 
  to shoulder with their fellow unionists on a lot of big problems; and a bit 
  relieved, to tell the truth, that no one had been raided, no one shot and that 
  the labor movement of Seattle was still &#8220;going strong.&#8221; For they 
  were quite aware that they had held in their hands a weapon which might have 
  exploded in any one of a dozen different directions. They were glad to find 
  themselves able to use it, to examine it and to lay it down without any premature 
  explosions.</p><p>
  And that is why they went back from the &#8220;glorious vacation&#8221; feeling 
  that they had won. Not perhaps exactly the things they had set out to win, but 
  something better. At any event, whether this be the explanation or not, the 
  fact remains that the workers went back, most of them, not feeling defeated, 
  but feeling quite reasonably successful, glad they had struck, equally glad 
  to call it off, and especially glad to think that their experience would now 
  be of use to the entire labor movement of the country as it makes its plans 
  for the Mooney general strike, by giving the necessary information of just what 
  happens in a community when a general strike occurs, what problems arise, and 
  how one city met them. And, for the giving of this needed knowledge and education, 
  the labor movement of Seattle rejoices to know that both its successes and its 
  mistakes will be of equal advantage to the labor movement of the country. </p><p>
