<p class="title">Unions and Workers: Limitations and Possibilities</p>
<p class="author">By Martin Glaberman</p>
<p>We are dealing with a complex and controversial question. The question of labor, 
  of the working class, of the union movement, has always been controversial. 
  The first problem is to try to understand the reasons for what everyone clearly 
  sees, and that is the decline of the organized labor movement in the United 
  States. Membership in the unions has gone down, the power of the unions has 
  gone down, and the influence of the unions in politics has gone down, and on 
  and on.... The tendency of many people, from the left, from the center, from 
  the right, is to lay the blame on individual union leaders. Better leaders mean 
  better unions. More militant leaders mean more militant unions.</p>
<p>I believe that sociologists need a little bit of history. In 1911 a book called 
  Political Parties by Robert Michels appeared, describing the bureaucratization 
  of the working class movements in Europe. It was based on a study of the German 
  Social Democratic Party. But bureaucratization has been a characteristic of 
  labor organizations, political parties, trade unions, etc., ever since. It has 
  been true of the socialist parties of Europe, it has been true of the trade 
  unions, and it has been true of the trade unions in the United States. If it 
  can be traced back that far, it seems to me it is somewhat superficial to blame 
  it on union leaders or the quality of union leadership. Why do such organizations 
  always choose bureaucratic leaders? There has to be something objective, something 
  fundamental, some thing that is continuing in the world that leads to the bureaucratization 
  of working class organizations.</p>
<p>I want to deal with three aspects of the decline of the union movement in the 
  United States; not simply bureaucratization, but decline. One element is the 
  role of the government. It is clear that in the United States the government 
  has been on the whole less sympathetic to labor, labor movements, labor organizations, 
  than countries in Western Europe. That, of course, is not an absolute. All one 
  has to do is look at the Thatcher government in Great Britain to see equivalent 
  records of anti-labor activity in Europe. But what people fail to realize is 
  something that is distinctive about American history and American development. 
  In Number 10 of the Federalist Papers, James Madison made a very interesting 
  point in his argument that people ought to vote in favor of the new constitution. 
  Essentially, what he said was that we, in the United States, are a country of 
  small property holders, primarily farmers. But we can look across the sea and 
  see the rise of a populous working class in the major cities of Europe. What 
  we need to do is protect ourselves from the inevitable change to a majority 
  of propertyless workers. His argument for the constitution was that the constitution 
  would make sure that a popular majority could not easily win control of the 
  government. This was accomplished by the division of powers, the separation 
  of federal and state, the separation of legislative, judicial, executive, and 
  so forth.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Legacy of the Founding Fathers</p>
<p>It strikes me that one of the reasons the United States tends to be at least 
  twenty years behind the rest of the industrial world in things like social welfare, 
  labor legislation, etc., is that legacy. The founding fathers were brilliant 
  and they built very well. They did what they intended to do, namely, prevent 
  a popular majority from easily and quickly winning control of the government.</p>
<p>The tendency always, even among sociologists, is to blame the victim. The reason 
  the American labor movement is in trouble, it is claimed, and the reason the 
  United States is backward is because of the backwardness of the American working 
  class. We do not have the political parties, we do not have the kind of union 
  movement, and we do not have the same history as the working classes of Europe. 
  Not quite. American workers built labor parties, called workingmen&#8217;s parties, 
  in the 1820&#8217;s and 1830&#8217;s, before the British working class had even 
  won the right to vote. They were quickly absorbed into the existing bourgeois 
  parties, the Whigs, the Democratic- Republicans, etc... They were co-opted, 
  as we would say today. Perhaps that was because the American working class in 
  that period was still young, still not fully formed. But, in any case, it seems 
  to me that it is impossible to describe that working class as backward. American 
  workers are a product of American history, as we all are. But backwardness is 
  not one of the characteristics of the American working class.</p>
<p>The point also needs to be made that the European labor and socialist parties 
  are not particularly superior to the American Democratic Party. They invariably 
  support their own national imperialisms, they supported NATO and the cold war, 
  and, if one looks at Great Britain, they are not especially adept at fighting 
  off right wing strike-breaking and anti-labor legislation.</p>
<p>Will the election of Bill Clinton, the governor of a right-to- work state, 
  make a difference and begin to turn things around? Perhaps, but not by much. 
  There will be some differences resulting from new appointments to boards and 
  agencies that unions have to deal with. There may eventually be further differences 
  resulting from new appointments to the federal courts. But the attempts of the 
  union movement to modify some of the existing anti-labor legislation, such as 
  Taft Hartley and Landrum-Griffith, could not even get through Democratic controlled 
  Congresses before the Reagan-Bush administrations. Are the chances for pro-union 
  legislation improved? Perhaps, but not by much. <br>
  In the United States there is another factor which has been amply documented, 
  particularly in labor history. One of the characteristics of the American labor 
  movement is something which labor historians have called the social compact. 
  It goes back at least to the garment unions in New York in the early years of 
  this century. Essentially it is an arrangement, some times formal, sometimes 
  informal, by which the unions receive for their members wages, fringe benefits 
  and so on, and in return give to the employer workers who work. At the height 
  of the militant 1930&#8217;s John L. Lewis, the head of the CIO, announced publicly, 
  with great pride, that a CIO contract was a guarantee against strikes. It was 
  not true then, and it probably won&#8217;t be true now or in the future. Nevertheless, 
  it gives a sense of what was involved. You give us wage increases, you give 
  us fringe benefits (although that came somewhat later)&#8212; in other words, 
  you give us things outside the process of work and we will see that our members 
  behave in a disciplined way and work and don&#8217;t wildcat and don&#8217;t 
  sabotage and don&#8217;t take days off and so on.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Social Unionism</p>
<p>One of the things that you hear in discussions of the American labor movement 
  is that we ought to go back to the days of &#8220;social unionism.&#8221; What 
  is forgotten is that social unionism is essentially a form of the social compact 
  and it is associated most strongly with Walter Reuther. What Walter Reuther 
  did was propose all kinds of plans; plans for the restructuring of the automobile 
  industry for war production; plans for the restructuring of the automobile industry 
  for conversion to peace-time production. He marched in civil liberties parades 
  in the South and in Washington. (He did not fight for upgrading blacks inside 
  the plants, inside the unions which he controlled.) And what he created in the 
  UAW, and what exists, more or less, in most large industries is what has been 
  called by labor relations people a one party state. That is, there is a certain 
  formal democracy, but one party rules.</p>
<p>If you permit me a little leeway, I would like to give you an experience out 
  of my own past. Years ago I got a job at a General Motors plant in Detroit. 
  The day before I was to get seniority and be protected by all the elements of 
  the union contract, the foreman called me over and told me I was fired. Which 
  was a mistake, because all he had to do, since I had no rights at all as a probationary 
  employee, was to tell me I was no longer needed and lay me off. But he said 
  I was fired, so I asked him to call the committeeman. The committeeman came 
  over &#8212; it was a hot Saturday, and I remember I had the pleasure of sitting 
  in the foreman&#8217;s air-conditioned office while he and the committeeman 
  wandered around the plant discussing my fate. They returned about an hour or 
  two later and the committeeman told me that Joe here will not fire you if you 
  agree not to do all these terrible things you were supposed to have done. Well, 
  since I didn&#8217;t admit that I had done them in the first place, although 
  some were done and some were not, I agreed. I agreed to stop beating my wife, 
  so to speak. I kept my job and I came in to work on Monday and I had seniority 
  and a totally different relation to the company. I could not be fired easily; 
  I could only be disciplined in a long process.</p>
<p>This is the union at its best. But what never left me is the argument that 
  the committeeman used to win me my job back. He said, look, management and labor 
  had a meeting several months ago and we agreed that we could not run the plant 
  without each other. Why do you come to me after this guy is fired? What you 
  should have done was come to me before he was fired and tells me the problem. 
  Then I go over to him and put my arm around him, and I say, hey, buddy, we don&#8217;t 
  work like that here. So I straighten him out, you don&#8217;t have a problem, 
  I don&#8217;t have a problem, and we don&#8217;t have to write a grievance.</p>
<p>In other words, he won his case, he won my case, because the foreman did not 
  permit him to participate in the management of the employees. I have been a 
  committeeman and I have been a steward, and that is part of the reality. You 
  see a guy fast asleep in the toilet. You can let him sleep, or you can wake 
  him up and say, hey, buddy, if you get caught there is no way I can save your 
  job. What is the difference? What I am doing is enforcing the contract, enforcing 
  the company rules. That, it seems to me, while not exactly what Michels said 
  years ago, is fundamentally the objective basis for the bureaucratization of 
  the union movement. It is based on contracts in which the company and the union 
  work out ways of living together.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Decline of the Social Compact</p>
<p>Why then the decline, why isn&#8217;t the social compact working? There is 
  one specific element that has to be seen in the social compact. That is the 
  militancy and the resistance of ordinary workers on their jobs. If the workers 
  weren&#8217;t militant and the workers didn&#8217;t resist, there would be no 
  basis for the compact. Why should a company agree with the union to grant concessions 
  if they did not need the union to help discipline workers and keep workers at 
  work? So the underlying reality is a working class that is consistently resisting 
  its life at work and the union which gets concessions outside of the work process 
  and provides discipline inside the work process.</p>
<p>What has changed in recent years? First, obviously, a much more conservative, 
  a much more reactionary, anti-labor ad ministration. Secondly, a long period 
  of substantial unemployment. Thirdly, the growing possibility to move production, 
  originally to other parts of the United States where labor is cheaper, but also 
  to move production abroad. As a consequence, it was possible for companies to 
  smash unions and to break strikes in ways which were not possible in the 30&#8217;s 
  or 40&#8217;s or 50&#8217;s or 60&#8217;s. The labor movement has been weakened 
  because the fundamental basis of the compact, that each side brings something 
  substantial to the table, was no longer as true as it was in the past.</p>
<p>Another sign of that reality is the continual change in the way corporations 
  try to deal with working class unrest. In 1991 there was a strike at the Lordstown 
  plant of General Motors which, in a matter of days, began to shut down more 
  and more plants of GM. Lordstown has a very interesting history. When it was 
  a new plant in the 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s, there was a lot of unrest there. 
  It was new, many of the workers were young, there was a lot of absenteeism, 
  there was sabotage, there was dope in the plant, etc.. At one point, in the 
  discussion of general unrest, of which Lordstown was typical, Time made a significant 
  observation: that everyone knows that what Marx said was wrong, but what is 
  forgotten is that one thing he talked about was true and is still relevant &#8212; 
  and that is alienation. That is what workers at Lordstown and elsewhere are 
  experiencing, the kind of alienation in work that Marx talked about. What emerges 
  is different stages of how to deal with that. There was Taylorism. In the 60&#8217;s 
  and 70&#8217;s there was job enrichment. That was the Scandinavian model. The 
  idea at Volvo was that if you get a team of six people together, each one, not 
  with a specific job, but sharing the work of putting an engine together, you 
  would get workers who were much more satisfied than otherwise.</p>
<p>That it didn&#8217;t quite work the way it was supposed to was reflected in 
  the fact that Swedish auto plants could not find enough Swedish citizens to 
  take these supposedly enriched jobs and they had to depend heavily on imported 
  labor. The reasons are not hard to find. One of the American plants that was 
  written up frequently as an example of job enrichment was a Gaines dog food 
  plant in Topeka, Kansas. An examination of that experience would illustrate 
  the limitations of such a program. To begin with, the plant had 90 workers, 
  which is not exactly the Ford assembly line. The workers were given the right 
  to organize the work in ways that suited them best. They even had the right 
  to interview and pass on new hires &#8212; to make sure that new workers were 
  compatible with the regular work force. But the basic problem was the nature 
  of the work itself. Dry dog food pellets were poured into sacks automatically, 
  the sacks were sealed and then placed on a loading dock. A simple question would 
  be: how enriched could that job ever become? I had visions of a young worker, 
  passing muster with his fellows and hired to be part of the work team. After 
  a couple of weeks I could picture this worker grumbling that this was a lousy 
  job, dull and meaningless. His fellow workers would try to correct him and tell 
  him that this used to be a lousy job, but now it was much better. And this young 
  worker would say that he didn&#8217;t know how the job used to be, but he did 
  know that it was a lousy job. The end of the story is that after a number of 
  years, job enrichment was abandoned by the company.</p>
<p class="subtitle">The Japanese Model</p>
<p>Now job enrichment has run its course and you have the Japanese model, Quality 
  Circles. One of the things they have in common is something which Taylor saw 
  and which most people do not relate to Taylorism. Taylor understood that workers 
  know how the job is done and managers don&#8217;t. The key to Taylorism was 
  that you first had to find out what the worker knew, and then management appropriated 
  that and reorganized the work. That is the point of job enrichment that is the 
  point of Quality Circles that is the point of the Japanese system. In fact, 
  in Japan there is an enforced program in most major companies of employee suggestions. 
  Your pay in creases, your merit increases, literally depends on your regularly 
  bringing suggestions to management. Again, this assumes that workers know about 
  work and managers don&#8217;t. That is the reality.</p>
<p>An aside: I have learned over the years that if! want to find out how militant 
  the American workers are, I don&#8217;t read the radical press, I read the Wall 
  Street Journal, I read Fortune, etc.. They don&#8217;t fool around with that 
  stuff and are not burdened by a party line that insists on the backwardness 
  of the workers. They are supposed to know and they talk to each other. They 
  assume that they don&#8217;t have a popular audience, which is true enough. 
  They will describe worker unrest and workers&#8217; movements the way Time talked 
  about alienation in relation to Lordstown and similar situations.</p>
<p>What about the future? The problem with the future is that sociology is not 
  really equipped to deal with it. We can count pretty good, but we can&#8217;t 
  predict the future. Back in 1963, in his presidential address, Everett C. Hughes, 
  the president of the American Sociological Association had as his theme (remember, 
  this is 1963) why sociologists did not predict and did not expect the emergence 
  of black militancy, the civil rights movement, etc.. He said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Why did social scientists &#8212; and sociologists in particular &#8212; 
  not foresee the explosion of collective action of Negro Americans toward immediate 
  full integration into American society? It is but a special instance of the 
  more general question concerning sociological foresight of and involvement in 
  drastic and massive social change and extreme forms of social action... </p>
<p>&#8220;Some have asked why we did not foresee the great mass movement of Negroes; 
  it may be that our conception of social science is so empirical, so limited 
  to little bundles of fact applied to little hypotheses, that we are incapable 
  of entertaining a broad range of possibilities, of following out the madly unlikely 
  combinations of social circumstances.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is sometimes said that sociology deals only with those processes 
  of social behavior which are repeated again and again... </p>
<p>&#8220;Perhaps we failed to foresee present racial movements because our whole 
  inward frame is adapted to study of the middle range of behavior, with occasional 
  conducted tours toward, but not dangerously near, the extreme.&#8221; </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that has changed particularly. Sociology has a very particular 
  character, a particular role. I was looking at a table of the ASA and there 
  was a little folder on jobs available in sociology, and it includes industrial 
  relations, human re sources management (which always sends a chill up and down 
  my spine.) In other words, among the functions of sociology are to manage people, 
  to keep order in the society, to improve productivity, and so on.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Alienation</p>
<p>Let me give you instead two other categories, units of time. A long time ago 
  Robert Blauner wrote a book on alienation in which he dealt with several industries, 
  chapter by chapter. In the chapter on the automobile industry he noted, this 
  was in the early sixties that the average job in the industry took a little 
  less than 60 seconds to do. By the time that the Lordstown plant was built, 
  the average job on the assembly line at Lordstown took about 36 seconds to do. 
  While obviously, jobs vary even within a particular factory, depending upon 
  whether you work on a machine or on an assembly line, the basic drive is for 
  greater productivity. The point is to reduce the time it takes to do any job.</p>
<p>Consider these two units of time: 36 seconds, the rest of your life. The job 
  that takes 36 seconds to do that you&#8217;re going to do for the rest of your 
  life. I don&#8217;t know a better definition of alienation than that. The job 
  can be quiet, which they rarely are; it can be clean, which they are usually 
  not; it can be light and easy, but 36 seconds to do a job for the rest of your 
  life&#8212; nobody will ever convince me that higher wages, fringe benefits, 
  a vacation cottage, a motor boat, a second car, and sending your kids to college 
  will reduce the oppression of that reality. It is that alienation, which Time 
  saw years ago, which is at the root of working class resistance and working 
  class struggle. It is the kind of thing which is virtually impossible to measure. 
  There are certain things you can&#8217;t count. You can&#8217;t operate on the 
  principle that if you can&#8217;t count it, it ain&#8217;t true; or, if you 
  can&#8217;t count it, it doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>
<p>Let me give you, again, a couple of examples from the modern world. In 1956 
  the working class of Hungary in 48 hours (there were things leading up to it 
  in the preceding day or so) created workers&#8217; councils and took over control 
  of all industry, offices, shops, etc.. In effect, the Communist Party was overthrown 
  and had to be reorganized under another name. The workers councils were destroyed, 
  not by anything in Hungarian society, but by an invasion of Soviet tanks.</p>
<p>In 1968, just to keep the balance even, in western Europe, after two weeks 
  of street fighting between students and police in Paris, there was a wildcat 
  strike in a little aircraft factory in Nantes, where young men and women workers 
  imprisoned the management in their offices and, again, within 48 hours, 10 million 
  French workers occupied all the factories of France and came within a hair&#8217;s 
  breadth of overthrowing the de Gaulle government. I think that the basic difference 
  between Hungary and France was that in Hungary the army clearly fell apart and 
  much of it went over to the side of the revolution, whereas in France de Gaulle 
  kept the army intact and there weren&#8217;t the signs of cracks in the military 
  structure. So, while the workers weren&#8217;t defeated, they only went so far 
  and then the movement receded and it ended with traditional trade union kinds 
  of gains.</p>
<p>Let me submit that if a sociologist did a survey in the working class suburbs 
  of Budapest in September of 1956, he or she would never have found out that 
  one month later the Hungarian working class was going to take over the means 
  of production. The same thing would have been true in the working class suburbs 
  of Paris in April of 1968. Why? Because the workers didn&#8217;t know. That 
  is not the way fundamental revolutions or uprisings or massive changes in society 
  take place. But it seems to me that that is the direction we have to look to 
  see what the future holds in store.</p>
<p>In the United States the working class has been defeated many times and it 
  has been revived many times. There was the Knights of Labor, which declined 
  after a massive strike wave in 1877. There was the beginning of the AFL and 
  its decline in the 1920s and its later revival. Related to these developments 
  is something that Marx indicated in his view that capitalism was revolutionary. 
  He attributed that to constant revolutions in technology and the means of production 
  which led to continual changes in all the social relations. In the famous strike 
  at Homestead in the 1890s, in which the growing steel workers&#8217; union was 
  crushed, the basic cause was the invention of a new process of making steel, 
  the Bessemer furnace, which downgraded the power of the skilled steel maker. 
  Akron today is no longer a major tire making center because of the development 
  of the bias tire. Printing unions are falling apart because of the replacement 
  of traditional printing with the new technology of word processing.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Militancy Will Emerge</p>
<p>That these things happen should not be a surprise. That labor unions do not 
  seriously resist them, given the bureaucratization of the labor unions, should 
  not be a surprise. But it also shouldn&#8217;t be a surprise that there will 
  once again emerge a militant American working class which will create organizations 
  that it feels it needs, not necessarily consciously, not particularly consciously, 
  to take back what it has been losing and, hopefully, to go further. Something 
  Marx wrote can help put this in a fundamental theoretical framework. In The 
  German Ideology, one of his early writings, he wrote:</p>
<p>&#8220;Both for the production on a mass scale of the communist consciousness, 
  and for the success of the cause itself, the alteration of men on a mass scale 
  is necessary, an alteration which can only take place in a practical movement, 
  a revolution; this revolution is necessary, therefore, not only because the 
  ruling class cannot be overthrown in any other way, but also because the class 
  overthrowing it can only in a revolution succeed in ridding itself of all the 
  muck of ages and become fitted to found society anew.&#8221; </p>
<p>I suggest that this is the opposite of what most people think Marx said. Marx 
  didn&#8217;t say we have to create new people in order to make a revolution. 
  He said we have to make a revolution in order to create new people. Where does 
  the revolution come from? Do you mean that the American working class, the sexist, 
  racist, American working class can make fundamental changes in this society? 
  It has over history. But if you think that you are going to reinvent the American 
  working class first, and then make fundamental changes, you might as well retire 
  and leave the struggle. It just doesn&#8217;t work that way. Revolutions are 
  made; the CIO upsurge was made, by ordinary people with all the limitations 
  of the society &#8212; driven by 36 seconds for the rest of your life. If you 
  can live with that daily reality, there will not be any fundamental change.</p>
<p>One of the problems sociologists have is that we tend to look at ordinary workers 
  as inferior beings. We wouldn&#8217;t stand for all that crap, right? That is 
  why we are in the academy. Why should we think workers would stand for that? 
  They never have, they never will, and that, it seems to me, is the future of 
  the American working class and the American labor movement. And when that upsurge 
  takes place, all these moribund bureaucratic unions are going to rush to get 
  to the head of the parade and say, Yes, we are going to lead you, and also we 
  are going to control you, and we can get new, better contracts, and so forth. 
  A lot of the things which unions can&#8217;t do now, they may be able to do 
  then. Whether that will be possible, I don&#8217;t know. I don&#8217;t think 
  history is simply a continual repetition of the past. But in the reality of 
  work is the motive power for change. If someone can change the nature of work 
  in capitalist society, then the impetus for change might decline and disappear. 
  But I have not seen anything to indicate such a possibility. The latest attempt 
  at &#8220;reforming&#8221; work is Quality Circles, the so-called Japanese model. 
  But the latest statistics show that when Quality of Work Life, or Employee Involvement, 
  as at Ford, are introduced, industrial accidents go up, which is another indication 
  that it is a very refined way of saying speed- up.</p>
<p>That remains, and the struggle remains, and change remains.</p>
