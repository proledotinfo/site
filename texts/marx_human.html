<p class="title">Selections from &quot;Comments on James Mill's <u>Elements of Political Economy</u>&quot;</p>
<p class="author">by Karl Marx (1844)</p>

<p>Man <em>produces</em> only in order to <em>have</em> &#8212; this is the
basic presupposition of private property. The aim of production is <em>having</em>.
And not only does production have this kind of <em>useful</em> aim; it has
also a <em>selfish</em> aim; man produces only in order to <em>possess</em>
for himself; the object he produces is the objectification of his <em>immediate</em>,
selfish <em>need</em>. For man himself &#8212; in a savage, barbaric condition
-- therefore, the amount of his production is determined by the <em>extent</em>
of his immediate need, the content of which is <em>directly</em> the object
produced.</p>


<p>Under these conditions, therefore, man produces <em>no more</em>
than he immediately requires. The <em>limit of his need</em> forms the <em>limit
of his production</em>. Thus demand and supply exactly coincide. The extent
of his production is <em>measured</em> by his need. In this case no exchange
takes place, or exchange is reduced to the exchange of his labour for the
product of his labour, and this exchange is the latent form, the germ,
of real exchange.</p>


<p>As soon as exchange takes place, a surplus is produced beyond
the immediate limit of possession. But this surplus production does not
mean rising above selfish need. On the contrary, it is only an <em>indirect</em>
way of satisfying a need which finds its objectification not in <em>this</em>
production but in the production of someone else. Production has become
a <em>means of gaining a living</em>, labour to gain a living. Whereas under
the first state of affairs, therefore, need is the measure of production,
under the second state of affairs production, or rather <em>ownership of
the product</em>, is the measure of how far needs can be satisfied.</p>

<p>I have produced for myself and not for you, just as you have produced
for yourself and not for me. In itself, the result of my production has
as little connection with you as the result of your production has directly
with me. That is to say, our production is not man's production for man
as a man, i.e., it is not <em>social</em> production. Neither of us, therefore,
as a man stands in a relation of enjoyment to the other's product. As men,
we do not exist as far as our respective products are concerned. Hence
our exchange, too, cannot be the mediating process by which it is confirmed
that my product&nbsp; is [for] you, because it is an <em>objectification</em>
of your own nature, your need. For it is not <em>man's nature</em> that forms
the link between the products we make for one another. Exchange can only
set in <em>motion</em>, only confirm, the <em>character</em> of the relation
which each of us has in regard to his own product, and therefore to the
product of the other. Each of us sees in his product only the objectification
of his <em>own</em> selfish need, and therefore in the product of the other
the objectification of a <em>different</em> selfish need, independent of
him and alien to him.</p>


<p>As a man you have, of course, a human relation to my product:
you have <em>need</em> of my product. Hence it exists for you as an object
of your desire and your will. But your need, your desire, your will, are
powerless as regards my product. That means, therefore, that your <em>human</em>
nature, which accordingly is bound to stand in intimate relation to my
human production, is not your <em>power</em> over this production, your possession
of it, for it is not the <em>specific character</em>, not the <em>power</em>,
of man's nature that is recognised in my production. They [your need, your
desire, etc.] constitute rather the <em>tie</em> which makes you dependent
on me, because they put you in a position of dependence on my product.
Far from being the <em>means</em> which would give you <em>power</em> over
my production, they are instead the <em>means</em> for giving me power over
you.</p>

<p>When I produce <em>more</em> of an object than I myself can directly
use, my <em>surplus</em> production is cunningly <em>calculated</em> for your
need. It is only in <em>appearance</em> that I produce a surplus of this
object. In reality I produce a <em>different</em> object, the object of your
production, which I intend to exchange against this surplus, an exchange
which in my mind I have already completed. The <em>social</em> relation in
which I stand to you, my labour for your need, is therefore also a mere
<em>semblance</em>, and our complementing each other is likewise a mere <em>semblance</em>,
the basis of which is mutual plundering. The intention of <em>plundering</em>,
of <em>deception</em>, is necessarily present in the background, for since
our exchange is a selfish one, on your side as on mine, and since the selfishness
of each seeks to get the better of that of the other, we necessarily seek
to deceive each other. It is true though, that the power which I attribute
to my object over yours requires your <em>recognition</em> in order to become
a real power. Our mutual recognition of the respective powers of our objects,
however, is a struggle, and in a struggle the victor is the one who has
more energy, force, insight, or adroitness. If I have sufficient physical
force, I plunder you directly. If physical force cannot be used, we try
to impose on each other by bluff, and the more adroit overreaches the other.
For the <em>totality</em> of the relationship, it is a matter of chance who
overreaches whom. The <em>ideal</em>, <em>intended</em> overreaching takes
place on both sides, i.e., each in his own judgment has overreached the
other.</p>


<p>On both sides, therefore, exchange is necessarily mediated by
the <em>object</em> which each side produces and possesses. The ideal relationship
to the respective objects of our production is, of course, our mutual need.
But the <em>real, true</em> relationship, which <em>actually</em> occurs and
takes effect, is only the mutually <em>exclusive possession</em> of our respective
products. What gives your need of my article its <em>value</em>, <em>worth</em>
and <em>effect</em> for me is solely your <em>object</em>, the <em>equivalent</em>
of my object. Our respective products, therefore, are the <em>means</em>,
the <em>mediator</em>, the <em>instrument</em>, the <em>acknowledged power</em>
of our mutual needs. Your <em>demand</em> and the <em>equivalent of your possession</em>,
therefore, are for me terms that are <em>equal in significance</em> and validity,
and your demand only acquires a <em>meaning</em>, owing to having an effect,
when it has meaning and effect in relation to me As a mere human being
without this instrument your demand is an unsatisfied aspiration on your
part and an idea that does not exist for me. As a human being, therefore,
you stand in no relationship to my object, because I <em>myself</em> have
no human relationship to it. But the <em>means is</em> the <em>true power</em>
over an object and therefore we mutually regard our products as the <em>power</em>
of each of us over the other and over himself. That is to say, our own
product has risen up against us; it seemed to be our property, but in fact
we are its property. We ourselves are excluded from <em>true</em> property
because our <em>property</em> excludes other men.</p>


<p>The only intelligible language in which we converse with one another
consists of our objects in their relation to each other. We would not understand
a human language and it would remain without effect. By one side it would
be recognised and felt as being a request, an entreaty,&nbsp;
and therefore a <em>humiliation</em>, and consequently uttered with a feeling
of shame, of degradation. By the other side it would be regarded as <em>impudence</em>
or <em>lunacy</em> and rejected as such. We are to such an extent estranged
from man's essential nature that the direct language of this essential
nature seems to us a <em>violation of human dignity</em>, whereas the estranged
language of material values seems to be the well-justified assertion of
human dignity that is self-confident and conscious of itself.</p>


<p>Although in your eyes your product is an <em>instrument</em>, a
<em>means</em>, for taking possession of my product and thus for satisfying
your need; yet in my eyes it is the <em>purpose</em> of our exchange. For
me, you are rather the means and instrument for producing this object that
is my aim, just as conversely you stand in the same relationship to my
object. But 1) each of us actually <em>behaves</em> in the way he is regarded
by the other. You have actually made yourself the means, the instrument,
the producer of <em>your</em> own object in order to gain possession of mine;
2) your own object is for you only the <em>sensuously perceptible covering</em>,
the <em>hidden shape</em>, of my object; for its production <em>signifies</em>
and seeks to <em>express</em> the <em>acquisition</em> of my object. In fact,
therefore, you have become for yourself a <em>means</em>, an <em>instrument</em>
of your object, of which your desire is the <em>servant</em>, and you have
performed menial services in order that the object shall never again do
a favour to your desire. If then our mutual thraldom to the object at the
beginning of the process is now seen to be in reality the relationship
between <em>master</em> and <em>slave</em>, that is merely the <em>crude</em>
and <em>frank</em> expression of our <em>essential</em> relationship.</p>


<p>Our <em>mutual</em> value is for us the <em>value</em> of our mutual
objects. Hence for us man himself is mutually of <em>no value</em>.</p>


<p>Let us suppose that we had carried out production as human beings.
Each of us would have <em>in two ways affirmed</em> himself and the other
person. 1) In my <em>production</em> I would have objectified my <em>individuality,
its specific character</em>, and therefore enjoyed not only an individual
<em>manifestation of my life</em> during the activity, but also when looking
at the object I would have the individual pleasure of knowing my personality
to be <em>objective, visible to the senses</em> and hence a power <em>beyond
all doubt</em>. 2) In your enjoyment or use of my product I would have the
<em>direct</em> enjoyment both of being conscious of having satisfied a <em>human</em>
need by my work, that is, of having objectified <em>man's</em> essential
nature, and of having thus created an object corresponding to the need
of another <em>man's</em> essential nature. 3) I would have been for you
the <em>mediator</em> between you and the species, and therefore would become
recognised and felt by you yourself as a completion of your own essential
nature and as a necessary part of yourself, and consequently would know
myself to be confirmed both in your thought and your love. 4) In the individual
expression of my life I would have directly created your expression of
your life, and therefore in my individual activity I would have directly
<em>confirmed</em> and <em>realised</em> my true nature, my <em>human</em> nature,
my <em>communal nature</em>.</p>


<P>Our products would be so many mirrors in which we saw reflected our
essential nature.</p>


<p>This relationship would moreover be reciprocal; what occurs on
my side has also to occur on yours.</p>


<p>Let us review the various factors as seen in our supposition:</p>


<p>My work would be a <em>free manifestation of life</em>, hence an
<em>enjoyment of life</em>. Presupposing private property, my work is an
<em>alienation of life</em>, for I work <em>in order to live</em>, in order
to obtain for myself the <em>means</em> of life. My work is <em>not</em> my
life.</p>


<p>Secondly, the <em>specific nature</em> of my individuality, therefore,
would be affirmed in my labour, since the latter would be an affirmation
of my <em>individual</em> life. Labour therefore would be <em>true, active
property</em>. Presupposing private property, my individuality is alienated
to such a degree that this <em>activity is</em> instead <em>hateful</em> to
me, a <em>torment</em>, and rather the <em>semblance</em> of an activity. Hence,
too, it is only a <em>forced</em> activity and one imposed on me only through
an <em>external</em> fortuitous need, <em>not</em> through an <em>inner, essential</em>
one.</p>


<p>My labour can appear in my object only as what it is. It cannot
appear as something which by its nature it is <em>not</em>. Hence it appears
only as the expression of my <em>loss of self</em> and of my <em>powerlessness</em>
that is objective, sensuously perceptible, obvious and therefore put beyond
all doubt.</p>
