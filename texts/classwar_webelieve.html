<p class="title">WHAT WE BELIEVE</p>
<p class="author">by the Class War Federation</p>
<p class="subtitle">Why Class War?</p>
<p> Class War is not just another party seeking to gain power or a new way of 
  telling people what to do. Class war is what happens when ordinary people have 
  had enough of being pushed around and decide to fight back. If you&#8217;re 
  one of the people who&#8217;ve swallowed the crap about &#8220;we&#8217;re all 
  middle class now&#8221; or &#8220;we live in a classless society&#8221; this 
  is the time to stop reading! We live in a society severely split along the lines 
  of class, where capitalism, the State and the ruling class dominate us. So what 
  do we mean by this?</p>
<p class="subtitle">Capitalism</p>
<p>Capitalism is an economic system run purely for profit in the interests of 
  a small class - the capitalists - at the expense of a larger class - the working 
  class. The whole of our present society is geared to the needs of capitalism. 
  It is the mechanism whereby we sell our labour, in exchange for money, to purchase 
  the goods and services we need, which we also happen to have produced in the 
  first place! However, we only get a proportion of the wealth that our labour 
  produces, the rest goes to the capitalists in profit.</p>
<p>This is fundamental to capitalism - in order for it to work the many must produce 
  wealth for the few. Western style capitalism is often hailed as being the free 
  market, all it means is that they are &#8220;free&#8221; to exploit us.</p>
<p>The situation is exactly the same in the so-called &#8220;planned economies&#8221; 
  of the &#8220;Communist&#8221; countries. Karl Marx suggested that capitalism 
  is a machine governed by natural laws - it isn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s an economic 
  system run by a group of people who compete fiercely with each other for the 
  right to rip us off. Capitalism has nothing to offer us except an endless cycle 
  of war, famine, recession and unemployment. It is not inevitable that it will 
  die of it&#8217;s own accord, it could linger on for centuries yet, lurching 
  from crisis to crisis, therefore it must be destroyed.</p>
<p class="subtitle">The State</p>
<p>Although capitalism is the major form of social organisation in terms of production, 
  there are things that it can&#8217;t do. Broadly speaking it cannot supply the 
  `social&#8217; organisation of society, this hole is filled by something else 
  - the State.</p>
<p>The State is the means by which a tiny minority control and dominate the rest 
  of us, in the interests of the ruling power in our society - the capitalists. 
  To give you an idea of how small a minority we are talking about, the often 
  quoted figures are still true - that 7% of the population owns 84% of the wealth. 
  The state is a set of institutions and bodies through which government is exercised 
  e.g. parliament, local government, ministries, civil service, police, law, education, 
  and the church. The aim of government is to keep the lid on class conflict, 
  and to control competition between the capitalist, to make sure of the smooth 
  running of society. It does this by enforcing the laws of private property, 
  and the right of capitalists to buy and sell it. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether 
  that property is land, food, health, sex, factories, houses or anything else 
  that takes their fancy.</p>
<p>But the State came before capitalism, and it has always been a form of control 
  and oppression in the interests of whatever ruling class is in power, and whatever 
  economic system they choose to use. In Britain we are given the `choice&#8217;, 
  every five years or so, of what Party we&#8217;d like to govern us. This, like 
  many other `choices&#8217;, is a false on, a con trick to fool us into thinking 
  we can change things through the vote. It also gives us politicians, as figureheads, 
  to blame for our difficulties.</p>
<p>But the reality is that the power of the state lies with the capitalists, and 
  the states own officials - they pull the strings. With power concentrated like 
  it is there is always the risk that a small group can mount an attempt to gain 
  control of the state, for example Fascists or Lenin-inspired communists. This 
  would be nothing more than swapping one set of bosses for another - we want 
  to sweep the lot of them away.</p>
<p class="subtitle">CLASS</p>
<p>Because capitalism represents exploitation, and the State represents domination, 
  it isn&#8217;t surprising that the society they have produced is split into 
  different categories, or classes, of people who hold a position directly in 
  relation to capitalism and the state.</p>
<p>It is important that we stress here that we have to generalise when defining 
  class, there are always exceptions to the rule, there are also sub-sections 
  within classes that can confuse the picture.</p>
<p><strong>The Ruling Class</strong><br>
  <em>About 5% of the population.</em><br>
  Some examples: Owners of major companies, landowners judges ,top cops, church 
  leaders and the aristocracy including the Royal Family.</p>
<p><strong>The Middle Class</strong><br>
  <em>About 20% of the population</em><br>
  Some examples :professionals e.g. journalists, doctors, teachers, management, 
  social workers Also priests, officers in the armed forces and the owners of 
  small businesses</p>
<p><strong>The Working Class</strong><br>
  <em>About 75% of the population</em><br>
  Some examples: Factory shop and office workers, nurses, technicians agricultural 
  workers, soldiers up to NCO level and the unemployed</p>
<p>The above figures are not the invention of Class War - they come from the State&#8217;s 
  own figures and were updated after the 1981 census.</p>
<p><strong>The Ruling Class</strong></p>
<p>In general there are two main factors that give you your place in the class 
  system : wealth and power. The ruling class rule but they don&#8217;t actually 
  govern - that is left to the State&#8217;s politicians and officials They don&#8217;t 
  all sit around in smoke filled rooms conspiring to oppress us, they don&#8217;t 
  need to most of the time. So how do they keep us in our place? By the old trick 
  of divide and rule - setting white against black, men against women and worker 
  against worker. This breaks down any sense of class solidarity, identity and 
  unity - without which a revolution is an impossible dream.</p>
<p><strong>The Middle Class</strong></p>
<p>Contact between the ruling class and the working class is very rare Most inter-class 
  contact comes between the working and middle classes. The middle class is made 
  up of many sub-sections and layers, all performing different roles and functions 
  necessary for capitalist society to run. Basically speaking they manage us in 
  the interests of the ruling class.</p>
<p>The most recognisable role for the middle class is the economic management 
  of business and industry e.g. work/factory managers, and accountants. These 
  are the top dogs, the highest earners in the middle class, because Without their 
  services capitalism would rapidly collapse.</p>
<p>By it&#8217;s very nature capitalism is filled with brutality and inequality. 
  If left to it&#8217;s devices it would end in either barbarism or class revolution. 
  Neither is any good to the ruling class, so this must be prevented by capitalism 
  putting on a `human face` - the caring side of capitalism! a large section of 
  the middle class provide this function. Mopping up the casualties of class society, 
  and providing a `buffer&#8217; for class anger, and sometime channeling it into 
  minor tinkering with social conditions. they also provide the vital services 
  we need, but at a cost to us - they have virtual control over whole areas of 
  our lives.</p>
<p>A not so obvious role of the middle class is to provide and intellectual and 
  cultural framework in which ideas that serve the interests of the ruling class 
  become part of our everyday thoughts. The endless repeating of certain ideas, 
  stereotypes and myths try to stifle our class consciousness and turn us into 
  `model citizens&#8217;. These can be the crude lies like ` all blacks are lazy 
  and thick&#8217; or the more sophisticated crap about the so-called `classless 
  society&#8217;. Examples would be the media and advertising industry, education 
  and religion.</p>
<p>Capitalism must have a constant supply of new ideas to create new markets to 
  sustain its profits. It must also evolve in order to survive. Middle class researchers 
  and intellectuals provide the information necessary to make this possible. This 
  is true right from university professors to the new so-called `green&#8217; 
  entrepreneurs.</p>
<p>Because of the varied roles of the middle classes there is often conflict and 
  contradictions within its ranks. When the class struggle comes to a head it 
  would split them, forcing them to take sides. As a general rule those near the 
  top would side with the bosses, having the most to lose. Those who come on our 
  side can only do so on our terms. Whish is to join us as equals, and not in 
  their usual role as leaders.</p>
<p><strong>The Working Class</strong></p>
<p>The briefest way of describing our class is to say we are everyone who is not 
  in the middle and ruling class! This is not just a smart arse remark. In general 
  the working class are people who live by their labour, the ownership of property 
  that generates wealth is the dividing line - if you have enough property or 
  money not to work then you are not working class.</p>
<p>The other part of class identity is `social power&#8217;. The working classes 
  do not have the power, we are the ones who are told what to do. We are defined 
  not by what we do, but by what is done to us. But this does not mean that we 
  are powerless - far from it. The state spends vast amounts of money and energy 
  to keep us in our place. Also, because our work is at the very centre of everyday 
  practical economic activity it is fair to say that everything hinges around 
  whether we want to `play the game&#8217; or not .</p>
<p>Class is a much disputed topic. the ruling class need to confuse the issue 
  in order to survive. If the majority of people have a clear idea of the workings 
  of a class society, social control would be impossible and the ruling class 
  would be toppled from their positions of wealth privilege and power.</p>
<p>As capitalism developed and class society became a feature of people&#8217;s 
  lives , the ruling class found it necessary to stifle class consciousness, and 
  even to get working class people to identify with capitalism. Myths like ` we&#8217;re 
  all middle class now&#8217; or ` we live in a classless society&#8217; , are 
  laughable and contradictory. These are the rantings of middle class journalists, 
  ad-men and politicians, who want to wish away class conflict and try to create 
  a false idea of equality.</p>
<p>With the rise of the `Consumer Society&#8217; and the easy availability of 
  credit, more and more working class people can afford things like their own 
  house, car, holidays abroad etc, But this increase of personal wealth does in 
  no way increase your social power. At the end of the day these extra goods all 
  rely on your ability to work. The day you lose your job and can&#8217;t keep 
  up the payments, they all go out the window along with the easy credit that 
  made them available. and at the same time when we can afford a few extra goodies, 
  the wealth of the already rich and powerful rises fantastically. What counds 
  is not token improvements in our life-styles but the gross inequality in the 
  overall distribution of wealth and power.</p>
<p>With the running down of the traditional heavy industries, the old image of 
  the working class has dramatically changed - massively so during the 1980&#8217;s. 
  In its place are more white collar workers, and the rise in service industry, 
  high tech and part time employment. But it&#8217;s ridiculous to say that just 
  because there is a more diverse labour market the working class has disappeared! 
  It hasn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s just that to the middle class politicians, media 
  people and journalists if you don&#8217;t wear overalls, a cloth cap, and get 
  your hands dirty at work you aren&#8217;t working class. That&#8217;s how thick 
  they really are!</p>
<p>The end of class society can only come about through working class revolution. 
  This is because the working class is the only social group capable of this massive 
  transformation of society, by virtue of the fact that we are the overwhelming 
  majority and because we have the interest, motivation and ability to do so. 
  History has shown us many examples of the working class&#8217;s revolutionary 
  ability, there is no good reason for thinking that this will be any different 
  in the future.</p>
<p class="subtitle">Class Struggle</p>
<p>As we said earlier, once you are aware of how crap this society is you either:</p>
<p>1) Do nothing about it because you belong to the ruling class or middle class 
  and have a lot to lose through a revolution</p>
<p>2) Take a cynical `why bother&#8217; attitude, believe that this is the way 
  it will always be and go back to sticking your head in the sand</p>
<p>3) Or you believe that things should change and that we have to organise and 
  fight back to do so.</p>
<p>How you go about doing number three depends on how much `change&#8217; you 
  actually want, and what exactly you are prepared to do. Some people feel they 
  are changing society by voting Labour, joining CND, becoming a vegetarian or 
  joining the Green party. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with being a Green, vegetarian 
  member of CND, but it is being criminally naive if you think it will really 
  change the overall structure of society. The same goes for those who think that 
  by `dropping out&#8217; and living some sort of `alternative lifestyle&#8217; 
  they are doing something to change society. They aren&#8217;t. The State can 
  tolerate millions of it&#8217;s citizens wandering off and living in teepees. 
  and would probably prefer them to do so since they would then be not harmless 
  , and no threat to the State. Others think that by voting Labour they&#8217;ll 
  achieve change. We don&#8217;t. Class War doesn&#8217;t prattle on about `waiting 
  for a Labour Government&#8221; or electing Socialist Councils because the Labour 
  Party is about as revolutionary as a pond full of ducks! It&#8217;s political 
  aims and ideas are just a `soft&#8217; version of capitalism. It also has a 
  negative and destructive influence because it pretends to be the political voice 
  of the working class. The reality is that it&#8217; s run by a motley collection 
  of bloated, corrupt union officials and trendy-lefty social worker types who 
  are nothing more than a load of parasitical, careerist bureaucrats, easing their 
  `radical consciousness&#8217; by naming tower blocks after obscure Latin American 
  freedom fighters and drinking Nicaraguan coffee at their smart parties, in their 
  smart houses in Hampstead and Holland Park.</p>
<p>Some people join Left-wing groups like the Socialist Workers Party, or Militant. 
  They do want to change society and realise (well some do) that it will only 
  change through a revolution. Class War believers this too ,but how these groups 
  see the coming about of a revolution, and what type of society will be formed 
  and by who, is fundamentally different to what we think and want.</p>
<p>Firstly Class War is not another `Party&#8221; trying to gain power. We don&#8217;t 
  want to swap one set of bosses for another, no matter how `radical and progressive 
  &#8216;they pretend to be. They talk about `democratic centralism&#8217; and 
  how the working class needs `their leadership&#8217; - What a joke! We don&#8217;t 
  need them anymore than we need the Tories or Labour - THEY NEED US! We have 
  no intention of destroying capitalism just so that it can be replaced by a NEW 
  state, and new laws. Quite apart from anything else, the very nature of these 
  tiny bands of `revolutionaries&#8217; who seem to form new groups, and splinter 
  groups, at the drop of a hat means they usually have an exclusively middle class 
  membership. The working class members soon leave. As a result they launch endless 
  new `front organisations&#8217; to try to recruit members. Based around issues 
  such as the war in Ireland, anti racism and sexism and gay rights etc. The damage 
  that has been done by their guilt-ridden brands of anti-racism and anti-sexism, 
  in particular, is a disgrace to see. In reality though, these obscure left wing 
  groups are little more than a talking shop where their members prattle away 
  to their hearts content about `the political relevance of one-legged tea pickers 
  in Tibet&#8217;. While the real world passes them by...</p>
<p>Unlike the Left we see the community as of crucial importance to our class. 
  It is obvious no what any major industrial battles will not succeed without 
  massive community support, such as during the Miners Strike. Crime and other 
  anti-social behavior, racism and sexism must be fought from within our communities, 
  we can&#8217;t sit back waiting for someone to do it for us. This is what the 
  Left want us to do, leave everything to them and they will sort it our for us. 
  But what usually happens is that as soon as something else appears on the horizon 
  they&#8217;re off like a shot! A good example of this is the Poll Tax - as soon 
  as it was announced that it was going to be scrapped they dropped it like a 
  hot potato, probably relieved that their would be no more riots in Trafalgar 
  Square that would threaten their cozy lifestyles.</p>
<p>To the Left the working class are there to be ordered about because we are 
  too thick to think for ourselves. The new concerns of the Left in this country 
  reflect the political, economic and cultural hopes of the middle class more 
  than ever before. Tragically any decent revolutionaries within these groups 
  usually become burnt out, disillusioned and are wasted. Class War makes no `revolutionary 
  demands&#8217; on behalf for the working class. But we do see the need to play 
  up the revolutionary elements within our struggles, towards an objective of 
  creating a popular `culture of resistance&#8217;. This is the popularisation 
  of the ideas of class struggle, class pride and identity, and the values of 
  solidarity, self-management and internationalism. Fundamentally this is about 
  bringing politics into all areas of peoples lives. At present the capitalists 
  invade all areas of our lives - in turn we will have to retrieve every part 
  of them.</p>

  any possible revolutionary movement. In areas of the world where this has happened, 
  like Spain, Italy and Russia, the traditions have lingered on generations after 
  the original movements were crushed - it&#8217;s powerful stuff!</p>
<p class="subtitle">WHAT WE DO</p>
<p>As we have said before, the Class War Federation doesn&#8217;t have all the 
  answers, neither do we pretend to. We are not a new &#8220;party&#8221;, or 
  leaders in waiting. Unlike the rest of the Left we don&#8217;t see ordinary 
  working class people as mindless, moronic sheep with no political brain of their 
  own who we must seek out and educate with our &#8220;superior&#8221; political 
  beliefs. We believe that ordinary people have our basic politics already - that 
  of suspicion of authority, and a hatred for the privileged elite. The role of 
  our propaganda is to champion and develop these ideas.</p>
<p>Our propaganda is fundamentally different from all the other political groups. 
  While the Left whine and moan about the power of the State, injustice, write 
  garbled theory and copy the dated writings of obscure 19th century intellectuals 
  or concentrate on &#8220;building the part&#8221;, Class War tries to increase 
  the confidence, autonomy, initiative and solidarity of working class people.</p>
<p>Moaning on and on about how terrible everything is, is depressing and boring 
  and encourages reformism (Green politics for example). We know that however 
  many reforms are made, the ruling class will be in direct, or indirect (e.g. 
  culturally) control of our lives. They will still control where and how we live 
  and work, and to a large extent what we think. Apart from sheer physical force, 
  the ruling class controls us by demoralisation, pacification, creating apathy, 
  robbing us of our identity as a class and fostering and encouraging prejudice 
  of every possible kind to divide us. Through our propaganda, we try to combat 
  this.</p>
<p>There are three ideas central to Class War, humour, populism and violence. 
  Some people have said that writing a paper in this style is patronising - well 
  that&#8217;s crap, of course many working class people are very capable of reading 
  intellectual material - and Class War is aimed at them as much as those who 
  aren&#8217;t. Humour is essential to the paper, firstly because is makes people 
  want to read it, and secondly because it is the best way we have of making our 
  point. People remember witty one-liners, and repeat them to their mates, taking 
  with it the political content. Humour is a very powerful weapon. It makes our 
  enemies seem ridiculous and less powerful.</p>
<p>Politics is not separate from everyday life, it is life. The idea that politics 
  must be boring and serious encourages us to forget this. The trouble with most 
  lefty papers is that they are difficult and boring to read. There is a reason 
  why people like to read The Sun. It&#8217;s not because they&#8217;re stupid 
  and ignorant, it&#8217;s because a lot of the time is a light entertaining read. 
  This isn&#8217;t saying that The Sun doesn&#8217;t talk crap. It just means 
  that there is a lot to be said for a paper that is simple, entertaining and 
  easy to read, and that&#8217;s what Class War should be like if we want people 
  to read it. The idea that if you enjoy reading a paper like that, or watching 
  soaps or sitcoms on the telly, means you&#8217;re thick, is just intellectual 
  bullshit.</p>
<p>Class War doesn&#8217;t shy away from violence, it promotes open class violence 
  - the idea of a lot of people fighting a common enemy. We feature people fighting 
  back in the paper to show that it happens all the time (it&#8217;s ignored or 
  marginalised by everyone else), and to show that it works, giving people the 
  confidence they need to take on capitalism and the State. After all the ruling 
  class aren&#8217;t just going to roll over and give up their power - it will 
  have to be taken from them.</p>
<p>We also produce a range of propaganda for people who have read Class War and 
  want to know more about what we believe - you&#8217;re reading some now! Our 
  theoretical journal, The Heavy Stuff, comes out regularly and goes into current 
  issues and affairs with more depth than Class War does. We also have Unfinished 
  Business, a 200 page book which goes into the present situation that our class 
  is in, how we got there, and how we can learn from the past to change the present. 
  All of the ideas you have read here are gone into in more detail, and it&#8217;s 
  highly recommended reading.
<p class="subtitle">
  WE ARE CLASS WAR</p>
<p>The Class War Federation is made up of normal people, we are not weirdoes or 
  loony lefties! Our politics are common sense and straightforward not the intellectual 
  ranting of university professors. We strongly believe that everyday life and 
  politics are the same thing. If your politics aren&#8217;t part of everyday 
  life then they are worthless. Our political activity must be as open to a 30 
  year old housewife, as to a 40 year old miner as to an OAP.</p>
<p>We do not demand 6am paper sales outside factories in the freezing cold, or 
  24 hour activity (endless rounds of meetings etc). Class War is not arrogant 
  like the Left, or your everyday politician. Yes, we do have ideas and we do 
  stand firm behind our views, but we don&#8217;t think we are perfect, we don&#8217;t 
  put forward a theory and say that if everyone followed it to the letter then 
  everything would be fine and the sun would always shine! Our politics come from 
  our lives and the real world; they are a necessity, not a theory.</p>
<p>Class War are not the only &#8220;Left wing&#8221; group who recognise that 
  working class people are political (because they have to be) - it&#8217;s just 
  that it&#8217;s couched in different terms from the intellectual claptrap of 
  the Left. We believe that it is right, and a necessity, that there should be 
  similar groups to our own, and that there should always be debate within our 
  Federation. Because we are a working class group, and because our politics come 
  from there, we are able to respect and work with working class people who are 
  not yet political, or who may have different views than our own.<br>
