<p class="title">THE OAKLAND GENERAL STRIKE
</p><p class="author">by Stan Weir</p>
</p><p>The Oakland (California) General Strike was an extension of the national
strike wave. It was not a 'called' strike. Shortly before 5 a.m., Monday,
December 3, 1946, the hundreds of workers passing through downtown Oakland
on their way to work became witness to the police herding a fleet of scab
trucks through the downtown area. The trucks contained commodities to fill
the shelves of two major department stores whose clerks (mostly women) had
long been on strike. The witnesses, that is, truck drivers, bus and
streetcar operators and passengers, got off their vehicles and did not
return. The city filled with workers, they milled about in the city's core
for several hours and then organized themselves.
</p><p>By nightfall the strikers had instructed all stores except pharmacies and
food markets to shut down, Bars were al lowed to stay open, but they could
serve only beer and had to put their juke boxes out on the sidewalk to
play at full volume and no charge. 'Pistol Packin' Mama, Lay That Pistol
Down', the number one hit, echoed off all the buildings. That first
24-hour period of the 54-hour strike had a carnival spirit. A mass of
couples danced in the streets. The participants were making history, knew
it, and were having fun. By Tuesday morning they had cordoned off the
central city and were directing traffic. Anyone could leave, but only
those with passports (union cards) could get in. The comment made by a
prominent national network newscaster, that 'Oakland is a ghost town
tonight,' was a contribution to ignorance. Never before or since had
Oakland been so alive and happy for the majority of the population. It was
a town of law and order. In that city of over a quarter mil lion,
strangers passed each other on the street and did not have fear, but the
opposite.
</p><p>Before the second day of the strike was half over a large group of war
veterans among the strikers formed their own squads and went through
close-order drills. They then marched on the Tribune Tower, offices of the
anti-labor OAKLAND TRIBUNE, and from there marched on City Hall demanding
the resignation of the mayor and city council. Sailor's Union of the
Pacific (SUP) crews walked off the three ships at the Oakland Army base
loaded with military supplies for troops in Japan. By that night the
strikers closed some grocery stores in order to conserve dwindling food
supplies. In all general strikes the participants are very soon forced by
the very nature of events to themselves run the society they have just
stopped. The process in the Oakland experiment was beginning to deepen.
There was as yet little evidence of official union leadership in the

streets. The top local Teamster officials, except one, were not to be
found; the exception would be fired five months later for his strike
activity. International Teamster President Dave Beck wired orders 'to
break the strike' because it was a revolutionary attempt 'to overthrow the
government'. He ordered all Teamsters who had left their jobs to return to
work. (OAKLAND TRIBUNE, December 5, 1946)
</p><p>A number of the secondary Oakland and Alameda County union leaders did
what they could to create a semblance of straight trade-union
organization. The ranks, unused to leading themselves and having no
precedent for this sort of strike in their own experience, wanted the
well-known labor leaders in the Bay Area to step forward with expertise,
aid, and public legitimization. The man who was always billed as leader of
the 1934 San Francisco General Strike, ILWU President Harry Bridges, who
was then also State CIO President, refused to become involved,, ,just as
he did 18 years later during the Berkeley Free Speech Movement struggles.
The rank-and-file longshoremen and warehouse- men who had been drawn to
the street strike were out there on their own. No organized contingents
from the hundreds available in the warehouse and longshore hiring halls
were sent to help, No CIO shops were given the nod to walk out or
'sick-out'. Only through CIO participation could significant numbers of
blacks have been drawn into this mainly white strike. The ILWU and other
CIO unions would honor picket lines like those around the Tribune Tower or
at the Oakland Army Base, but otherwise they minded their own business.
Bridges had recently committed himself to a nine-year extension of the
wartime no-strike pledge.
</p><p>The one major leader of the San Francisco General Strike who would come to
Oakland was the SUP's Secretary Treasurer, Harry Lundeberg. On the second
night of the strike he was the principal speaker at the mass meeting in
the overflowing Oakland Auditorium. He had been alerted when the strike
was less than three hours old via a cafl from an old-time member at a pay
phone on an Oakland street. By noon there were contingents composed mainly
of Hawaiians acting as 'flying squads', patrolling to find any evidence of
strike-breaking activity. They enlarged Upon their number by issuing large
white buttons to all seamen or persons on the Street that they knew. The
buttons con tained the words ' Brotherhood of the Sea', They represented
the first officially-organized activity on the street, They did not
attempt to run the entire strike or take over. It takes a time for seamen
to get over the idea that they are somehow outsiders, The feeling is all
the stronger among Hawaiian seamen ashore or residing in the States. They
limited their activity to trouble-shooting. They won gratitude and
respect. When Lundeberg spoke at the meeting, he had no program of action
beyond that of the Oakland AFL leaders. But he got a wild response. He did
not approach the microphone reluctantly. His demeanor reflected no
hesitancy. Unlike the other speakers, he bellowed with outrage against the
city council on behalf of the strikers. In a heavy Norwegian accent he
accused: 'These finky gazoonies who call themselves city fathers have been
taking les sons from Hitler and Stalin. They don't believe in the kind of
unions that are free to strike.' All true, but whether he knew it or not,
by focusing on the City Council and no more, he was contributing to the
undercutting of the strike, Instead of dealing with the anti-labor
employers and city officials through the medium of the strike, plans were
already being formulated to deal with the crisis in the post-strike period
by attacking the City Council through use of the ballot box. The top
Alameda County CIO officials were making hourly statements for the record
that they could later use to cover up their disloyalty, The AFL officials
couldn't get them to come near the strike, but they could be expected to
participate in post-strike electoral action.
</p><p>The strike ended 54 hours old at 11 a.m. on December 5.
The people on the street learned of the decision from a sound truck put on
the Street by the AFL Central Labor Council. It was the officials' first
really decisive act of leadership. They had consulted among themselves and
decided to end the strike on the basis of the Oakland City Manager's
promise that police would not again be used to bring in scabs. No
concessions were gained for the women retail clerks at Kahn's and Hastings
Department Stores whose strikes had triggered the General Strike; they
were left free to negotiate any settlement they could get on their own.
Those women and many other strikers heard the sound truck's message with
the form of anger that was close to heartbreak, Numbers of truckers and
other workers continued to picket with the women, yelling protests at the
truck and appealing to all who could hear that they should stay out. But
all strikers other than the clerks had been ordered back to work and no
longer had any protection against the disciplinary actions that might be
brought against them for strike-caused absences, By noon only a few score
of workers were left, wandering disconsolately around the now-barren city,
The CIO mass meeting that had been called for that night to discuss strike
'unity' was never held.
</p><p>In the strike's aftermath every incumbent official in the major Oakland
Teamsters Local 70 was voted out of office. A United AFL-CIO Political

Action Committee was formed to run candidates in the race for the five
open seats on the nine-person City Council. Four of them won, the ballot
listed the names of the first four labor challengers on top of each of the
incumbents, but reversed the order for the fifth open office, It was felt
that the loss was due to this trick and anti-Semitism. The fifth labor
candidate's name was Ben Goldfarb. Labor's city councilmen were regularly
outvoted by the five incumbents; however, the four winners were by no
means outspoken champions of labor. They did not utilize their offices as
a tribune for a progressive labor-civic program. They served out their
time routinely, and the strike faded to become the nation's major unknown
general strike.
</p><p>The Oakland General Strike was related to the 1946 Strike Wave in time and
spirit, and revealed an aspect of the tem per of the nation's
industrial-working-class mood at war's end. Labor historians of the
immediate post-war period have failed to examine the Oakland Strike, and
thus have failed to consider a major event of the period and what it
reveals about the mood of that time. In developing their analyses they
have focused almost entirely on the economic demands made by the unions
that participated in the Strike Wave. These demands were not unimportant.
But economic oppression was not the primary wound that had been
experienced daily during the war years.
</p><p>The 'spontaneous' Oakland General Strike was a massive event in a major
urban area with a population similar to that of all major World War II
defense-industry centers, Thousands had come to the Bay Area from all
corners of the nation-rural and urban-in the early war years, and had
stayed. Every theatre of war was represented among armed-forces veterans
returning to or settling in this largest of Northern California's central
city cores. The Oakland General Strike revealed fundamental
characteristics of a national and not simply a regional mood. Its events
combined to make a statement of working-class awareness that World War II
had not been fought for democracy. Or, more pointedly, it was a
retaliation for the absence of democracy that the people in industry and
the armed forces had experienced while 'fighting to save democracy in a
war to end all wars', The focus of people's lives was still on the war.
They hadn't fought what they believed to be 'a war against fascism' to
return home and have their strikes broken and unions housebroken.
</p><p>Emotionally, their war experiences were still very real, and yet they were
just far enough away from those experiences to begin playbacks of memory
tapes. The post-war period had not yet achieved an experiential identity.
The Oakland Key System bus drivers, streetcar conductors, and motormen who
played a leading role in the strike wore their Eisenhower jackets as work
uniforms, but the overseas bars were still on their sleeves. Like most,
they had lost four years of their youth; and while they would never
complain about that loss in those terms, there were other related
grievances over which resentment could be expressed.
