            <p>We look around us and see a world beyond our control.</p>

            <p>Something is feeding off our lives and spitting back images of 
              them in our faces.</p>
            <p>That something is the product of our own activity&#8230; our everyday 
              working lives sold hour after hour, week after week, generation 
              after generation.</p>
            <p>We don&#8217;t have property or a business we can make money from, 
              so we are forced to sell our time and energy to someone else. We 
              are the modern day working class&#8212;the proles.</p>

            </blockquote>
            <p>We don&#8217;t work because we want to. We work because we have 
              no other way to make money. We sell our time and energy to a boss 
              in order to buy the things we need to survive.</p>
            <p>We are brought together with other workers and assigned different 
              tasks. We specialize in different aspects of the work and repeat 
              these tasks over and over again. Our time at work is not really 
              part of our lives. It is dead time controlled by our bosses and 
              managers. During our time at work we make things that our bosses 
              can sell. These things are objects like cotton shirts, computers 
              and skyscrapers or qualities like clean floors and healthy patients 
              or services like having a bus take you where you want to go, having 
              a waiter take your order or having someone call you at home to try 
              to get you to buy things you don&#8217;t need. The work is not done 
              because of what it produces. We do it to get paid, and the boss 
              pays us for it to make a profit.</p>
            <p>At the end of the day the bosses re-invest the money we make them, 
              and enlarge their businesses. Our work is stored up in the things 
              our bosses own and sell&#8212;capital. They are always looking for 
              new ways to store up our activity in things, new markets to sell 
              them to, and new people with nothing to sell but their time and 
              energy to work for them. What we get from work is enough money to 
              pay for rent, food, clothes and beer&#8212;enough to keep us coming 
              back to work.</p>
            <p>When we&#8217;re not at work, we spend time traveling to or from 
              work, preparing for work, resting up because we&#8217;re exhausted 
              from work or getting drunk to forget about work. The only thing 
              worse than work, is not having it. Then we waste our weeks away 
              looking for work, without getting paid for it. If welfare is available, 
              it is a pain-in-the-ass to get and is never as much as working. 
              The constant threat of unemployment is what keeps us going to work 
              everyday. And our work is the basis of this society. The power our 
              bosses get from it expands every time we work. It is the dominant 
              force in every country in the world.</p>
            <p>At work we are under the control of our bosses, and of the markets 
              they sell to. But an invisible hand imposes a work-like discipline 
              and pointlessness on the rest of our lives as well. Life seems like 
              a kind of show we watch from the outside, but have no control over. 
              All sorts of other activities tend to become as alienating, boring and stressful 
              as work: housework, schoolwork, leisure. That&#8217;s capitalism.</p>

            <p>Work is experienced very differently depending on which side of 
              it you&#8217;re on. For our bosses, work is the way that they get 
              their money to make more money. For us, work is a miserable way 
              to survive. The less they pay us, the less we make. The faster 
              they can get us to work, the harder we have to work. Our interests 
              are opposed, and there is a constant struggle between bosses and 
              workers at work&#8212;and in the rest of the society based on work. 
              The more we pay in rent or bus fare, the more we have to work to 
              pay our rent or bus fare.</p>
            <p>The current state of wages, benefits, hours and working conditions 
              as well as politics, art and technology is a result of the current 
              state of this class struggle. Simply standing up for our own interests 
              in this struggle, is the starting point of undermining capitalism.</p>

			  Civilization is deeply divided. Most of us spend most of our time 
              working and are mostly poor, while the owners, who are mostly rich, 
              manage and profit off our work. All the communities and institutions 
              of society are built up around this basic division. There are racial, 
              cultural and language divisions and communities. There is division 
              and community around sex and age. There is the community of the 
              nation and citizenship, as well as the division between nations 
              and those with and without citizenship. We are divided and united 
              around religion and ideology. We are brought together to buy and sell on the market. Some of these identities have been 
              around for millennia. Some are a direct result of the way we work 
              today. But they are all now organized around capital. They are all 
              used to help our bosses accumulate more of our dead time stored 
              up in things, and to keep the basic division of this society from 
              tearing it apart. Poor people from one country can be made to identify 
              with their bosses from the same country and can be made to fight 
              poor people from other countries. Workers have a harder time organizing 
              a strike with workers who look different and speak a different language, 
              especially if one group thinks it&#8217;s better than the other. 
              These divisions and communities are reflected in and reflect the division 
              of labor at work.</p>
            <p>While these divisions and exclusive communities are being pushed 
              on us from one side, an all-inclusive human community is sold to us from the other. This community is just as imaginary and false. 
              It denies the basic division of society. Business owners run the 
              government and the media, the schools and prisons, the welfare offices 
              and the police. We have our lives run by them. The newspapers and 
              television put forward their view of the world. Schools teach about 
              the great (or unfortunate) history of their society and produce 
              a spectrum of graduates and dropouts fit for different kinds of 
              work. The government provides services to keep their society running 
              smoothly. And when all else fails, they have the police, the prisons 
              and the army.</p>
            <p>This is not our community.</p>

            <p>They organize us against each other, but we can organize ourselves 
              against them.</p>
            <p>The whole point of talking about class and &#8220;the proles&#8221; 
              is to insist on the very basic way in which people from different 
              &#8220;communities&#8221; have essentially similar experiences, 
              and to show that people from the same &#8220;communities&#8221; 
              should in fact hate each other. This is the starting point to fighting 
              the existing communities. When we begin to fight for our own interests 
              we see that others are doing the same thing. Prejudices fall away, 
              and our anger is directed where it belongs. We are not weak because
              we are divided. We are divided because we are weak. </p>
            <p>The existing communities become irrelevant as they 
              are attacked, and they are attacked by becoming irrelevant. Racism 
              and sexism are unappealing, when working men and women of different 
              races are fighting their class enemies side by side. And that fight 
              becomes more effective by involving people from different &#8220;communities&#8221;. 
              There will be no need for a stand-in for everything that can be 
              bought and sold&#8212;money--when there is no need to measure work 
              time stored in those things. This could only happen when we make 
              and do things because there is a need for them and not in order 
              to exchange them. There will be no need for a government to manage 
              society, when society is not divided between management and workforce&#8212;when 
              people can run their lives themselves. There will be no need for 
              national or racial communities&#8212;and there could be a human 
              community&#8212;when society is not divided into rich and poor. 
              The way to create these conditions is to fight the existing conditions.</p>
            <p>This tendency to create community by fighting against the conditions 
              of our lives&#8212;and therefore against work, money, exchange, 
              borders, nations, governments, police, religion, and race&#8212;has 
              at times been called &#8220;communism&#8221;.</p>

                --The Alarm (anarchist newspaper from Chicago in the 1880s)</p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>The government is the model for political activity. Politicians 
              representing different countries, regions, or &#8220;communities&#8221; 
              battle with each other. We are encouraged to support the leaders 
              we disagree with least, and we're never really surprised when they 
              screw us over. All a politician&#8217;s working class background 
              or radical ideals are worthless once they begin to govern. No
              matter who is in government, government has its own logic. The fact 
              that this society is divided into classes with opposing interests 
              means that it is always at risk of tearing itself apart. The government 
              is there to make sure that doesn&#8217;t happen. Whether the government 
              is a dictatorship or a democracy, it holds all the guns and will 
              use them against its own population to make sure that we keep going 
              to work.</p>
             <p>Not that long ago, an extremely unstable situation in a particular 
              country could be diffused by nationalizing all of a country&#8217;s 
              industries, creating a police state, and calling it &#8220;communism&#8221;. 
              This kind of capitalism proved to be less efficient and less flexible 
              than good old-fashioned free market capitalism. With the fall of 
              the Soviet Union, there is no longer a Red Army to march in and 
              stabilize countries in this way, and Communist parties around the 
              world are becoming simple social democrats.</p>
            <p>A working class political party is a contradiction in terms&#8212;not 
              because the membership of a particular party can&#8217;t be largely 
              working class, but because the most it can do is give the working 
              class a voice in politics. It lets our representatives put forward 
              ideas on how our bosses should run this society--how they can make 
              money and keep us under control. Whether they are advocating nationalization 
              or privatization, more welfare or more police (or both), the programs 
              of political parties are different strategies for managing capitalism.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, politics also exists outside of government. Community leaders, professional activists and unions want to place themselves between workers and bosses and be the mediators, the negotiators, the means of communication, the representatives, and ultimately the peacemakers. They fight to keep this position. In order to do that, they need to mobilize the working class in controlled ways to put pressure on more business-oriented politicians, at the same time offering business a workforce that is ready to work. This means that they have to disperse us when we start to fight back. Sometimes they do this by negotiating concessions, other times by selling us out. Politicians always call on us to vote, to sit back and let the organizer negotiate, to fall in line behind the leaders and the specialists in a kind of passive participation. These non-governmental politicians offer the government a way to maintain the status quo peacefully, and in return they get jobs managing our misery.</p>
            <p>Political groups are bureaucratic. They tend to mirror the structures 
              of work where activity is controlled from the outside. They create specialists
              in politics. They are built on 
              a division between leaders and led, between representatives and 
              represented, between organizers and organized. This is not a bad 
              choice of how to set up organizations, to be remedied with a large 
              dose of participatory democracy. It is a direct result of what political 
              groups and activities are trying to do--to manage a part of capitalism.</p>
            <p>The only thing that interests us about politics is its destruction.</p>

            <p>When we start to fight against the conditions of our lives, a completely 
              different kind of activity appears. We do not look for a politician

              try to extinguish it in a flood of petitions, lobbying and election

              looks completely different from theirs. We take property away from 
              landlords and use it for ourselves. We use militant tactics against 
              our bosses and end up fighting with the police. We form groups where 
              everyone takes part in the activity, and there is no division between 
              leaders and followers. We do not fight for our leaders, for our 
              bosses or for our country. We fight for ourselves. This is not the 
              ultimate form of democracy. We are imposing our needs on society 
              without debate&#8212;needs that are directly contrary to the interests

            <p>So we&#8217;re in a war&#8212;a class war.</p>
            <p>There is no set of ideas, proposals, and organizational strategies 
              that can bring victory. There is no solution outside of winning 
              the war.</p>
            <p>So long as they have the initiative, we are separated, and passive. 
              Our response to the conditions of our lives is individual: quitting 
              our jobs, moving to neighborhoods with cheaper rent, joining subcultures 
              and gangs, suicide, buying lottery tickets, drug abuse and alcoholism, 
              going to church. Their world looks like the only possibility. Any 
              hope for change is lived on an imaginary level&#8212;separated from 
              our everyday lives. It&#8217;s business as usual, with all 
              the crisis and destruction that this implies.</p>
            <p>When we go on the offensive we begin to recognize each other and 
              to fight collectively. We use the ways that society depends on us 
              to disrupt it. We strike, sabotage, riot, desert, mutiny and take 
              over property. We create organizations in order to amplify and coordinate 
              our activities. All kinds of new possibilities open up. We grow 
              more daring and more aggressive in pursuing our own class interests. 
              These do not lie in forming a new government, or becoming the new 
              boss. Our interests lie in ending our own way of life&#8212;and 
              therefore the society that is based on that way of life.</p>
            <p>We are the working class who want to abolish work and class. We 
              are the community of people who want to tear the existing community 
              apart. Our political program is to destroy politics. In order to 
              do that, we have to push the subversive tendencies that exist today 
              until we have completely remade society everywhere. This has at 
              times been called &#8220;revolution&#8221;.</p>
